configuration devoid of bloatware thankfully
but that's really about it
that's a little bit roomier
it's not quite as tight
what we've noted here however
s4 in the rear view
it's a rather nice box
i think that's pretty average
it's okay it's not good
nicely built um you know
that does the job then

it's the tab itself before
display of 800 by 1280

now you'll have noticed lately
it's pretty good viewing angles
so some nice texture there
this is well worth considering
it's a really nice experience
ok let's start inside box
hope you enjoyed the video
I wish it could be
but that's just the way
thank you to who yawns
I really appreciate the opportunity
the tablet is 10 inches
it protected the tablet really
Play and things like that
I'd prefer a rechargeable pen
it really didn't bother me
I think it's really good
this is a quick example
i've tried facebook on it
it's um found your location
hopefully you enjoyed this video
it's not an extra battery
that's not a good sign
PCIe mode the only time
there's not a lot of
she can get on YouTube
stuck at home me too
we all are social distancing
my company is still functioning
I'm such a bad liar
okay and look at that
I actually have some time
this happens with most devices
I swapped out my trusty
it's got a strong build
it feels good and solid
ask and you shall receive
it is very apparent it
they look very very nice
they both look absolutely fantastic
we covered the three basics
the pdfs reading and manga
Keogh matrix pad s8 edition
OH matrix patent s8 review
let's open it up now
this is typical thinkpad packaging
i'm really impressed with it
a little bit larger display
this is an excellent keyboard
this is the front-facing camera
gotta say that all right
let's check out that display
it also covers the color
and that's thanks to that
and that's really fast now
they're two front facing speakers
let's wrap it all up
lenovo includes its magnetic keyboard
the backlit keyboard in general
what's new is in sigh
you get the tablet itself
i really like the surface
the drawing surface is really
ui is pleasing and intuitive
this is the metallic back
is that a charging cable
the default value is fine
NT it was quite bad
cs5 pressure works very well
this is MIDI Bank pinch
there is no lack here
it doesn't work with me
so that's the problem here
the physical shortcut buttons here
viewing angles are pretty good
I found it quite nice
you can do anything light
you know it's quite impressive
I have two two monitors
which is the hdmi cable
but i ain't complaining though
remover onwards to the tablet
so these are the contents
i'll be finishing my paintings
they provided an extra pen
would i recommend this tablet
how well do they respond
it is good and clear
you get your general games
so it's a one thing
these particular headphones are actually
this is actually a nice
it's it's not all right
this is the sim bans
we have a warranty card
we have this little clip
this screen is quite reflective
the volume buttons are here
so it's actually quite responsive
reproduction is actually quite good
Android OS tablet or smartphones
I put down the department
and that's that strange stroke
it's quite responsive so when
I'm drawing at normal speed
I really like this app
let's try and sheet this
let's create some dots here
Jeeter but it's very minimal
well I was writing this
this is normal drawing speed
I think it looks fine
the responsiveness is quite decent
the battery life is great
Android is the Samsung tablets
this thing is absolutely huge
ok let's do that properly
I have one of these
go-to tablet every other tablet
this is my honest opinion
oh my oh my gosh
no beach has a tablet
oh i see a pen
oh and there's a glove
this is a quad-core CPU
PC it's running Windows 10

stop call the and next
Sorry, I'm still excited ...
but there are some things
I really like about it
I've used these practice pages
hi everyone mahmoud is here
i like the usb cable
at least for mac right
um yep everything works great
seven well to be honest
I would highly recommend this
a 'but reviews trademark symbol
one is a power button
there are four screw holes
then you use the provided
it wasn't more entertaining inside
I had immediately mistaken it
second isn't really a complaint
the display looks very nice
there are some miscellaneous pros
which is roughly around 120
so is it worth it
they're both at gleamie arts
so let's go in right
it takes a few minutes
um it looks really nice
um i quite like it
subscribe if you want to
is this default home screen
let's drop this agenda widget
I like the UI interface
let's go to tech me
also pinch-to-zoom etc is silky
smooth as you can see
actually you can load any
Android app on the tablet
what do you say keyboard
what do you say swipe
the what do you say
I have with this tablet
Polaris Office with this tablet
so you can open up
so that's a great value
I'd really like about this
you are watching a little
TV with the brand-new Toshiba
HDMI plugged in right now
I managed to break one
you can see it here
we didn't register it yet
stick it in the post
I liked the power adapter
IPS panel as the original
I'm trying to load here
it needs the active venting
it adds exception little bulk
I add original touch cover
run time about ten hours
III enjoy the Dell product
Huion. No thank you guys.
Lovely which had another pen
you got your power cable
There we go okay now
But the glove solves it
well what else is there?
it's an entry level tablet
the resolution is pretty low
but they don't supply one
I'm pretty impressed with that
you can run these things
that's going to be something
this is for Star Trek
this is a 1080p video
I'll get rid of that
it's got you know the
Play Store is all there
it does have dual cameras
I've got the hair pad
run pretty smooth as well
I've tried modern combat 5
and it lags a lot
I know the thin metal
it doesn't have the full
you can see the available
you can take a look
not a huge number again
this is a pretty fast
there is no pinch zooming
you have to be careful
obviously it's not supremely loud
this is pretty good next
go figure so that's the
it's very reasonable at $199
the device isn't that fast
unboxing for you guys so
so now we can compare
look at all the clownfish
I think it's a fox
pull tab on them now
this is a 13-inch unit
but what really surprised me
now this is again her
it has the click wheel
I mean there's no jitter
XP pen was the driver
hooked up now this one
I also love the pen
I wanted it to do

thank you guys for watching
just like the previous tablet
it just looks really nice
you know what i'm saying
has some pretty awesome specs
right there so pretty awesome
that's a beautiful looking screen
i mean that looks great
what up let's see boom
this is probably the weakest
it's really nice and simple
it's comfortable in the hand
the construction seems very nice
like an eight inch tablet
what the masked tablets were
we've got everything we want
it's a small tablet though
this is absolutely fine now
the pen is actually nice
now that's all one cable
there's an instruction manual which
it did get it calibrated
the parallax isn't too bad
I was happy with this
this is full color one
the tablet does feel well-made
let's say a surface book
this isn't anyone in particular
the rotating ring was clean
everybody knows that everybody knows
work on this tablet definitely
I can do it faster
the tablet is pretty decent
I'm pretty happy with this
I mean that's pre swish
is this something you'd buy
have you already got one
have a very good day
we have these drawing tablets
welcome to panels and borders
interesting enough expensive tablet brands
i'd have to comment that
gaomon sells tablet holders separately
your tablet can work now
i genuinely appreciate this tablet
you know user friendly also
i personally recommend this tablet
today's sponsor is xp pen
bamboo tablet since grade 11
the boxes alone are adorable
just put those aside there
this is a protective film
so we've got another cover
so this is the stand
there's no worries about that
i found that it was
which of course is different
i find that my ipad
hey there in this video
I've made it so anyway
it's it's a big box
I didn't notice right off
okay so boring stuff first
it didn't work so anyway
this is the plug that
but if you want to
so this is the tablet
so let's get this off
I'll put a picture somewhere
okay and that's really all
this is actually three $59.99
they didn't give me any
I'm not really seeing them
this within this is srgb
that's the smaller gamut there
there's just the eyeball test
it's not a big difference
make sure you're calibrating it
I'm just not used to
the stylist is very comfortable
there's a 1.2 megapixel webcam
slot for storage expansion micro
that's a complete fingerprint magnet
yeah i said it right
i might drop the tablet
we have the pen case
it fits my hand perfectly
the tablet looks really nice
it has four rubber feet
okay yeah it does work
i decided to draw millie
that won't be forgotten forever
you guys see ya you
and let's talk about the
this one is super natural
right there on the tablet
my rankings are flat-out insane
thank you much for watching
so let's get started first
okay how about the adapters
it works just practice now
we do have a micro
let's talk about this screen
google play music through the
we're able to swipe through
Sony's media collection and download
what is going on guys
is it gonna be good
the battery is 5,000 milliamps
I haven't had too much
the speakers are horrendous horrendous
which is the best processor
which if you set up
double press the power button
I'll sort of prevent ringing
I'll provide a short summary
O's for Bluetooth pen tablet
you can make various adjustments
so the connectivity was great
I lost some an act
is you can draw various
I do have a ton
it's this gloss edge right
I'm the type of person
i believe it's 18 hours
you can just double check
between eight to ten hours
just be careful with it
i did purchase this device
setup can be really tricky
the case is like hopefully
it's not a sticky case
that's not bad and i
and that's just a bummer
it's powered off right now
we have a power cable
so there's a charger cable
it just doesn't feel good
um and then yeah so
see how dark it is
we are ready to go
i do not like it
it's a little bit brighter
let's go a different color
let's go like um gray
the ghosting is a problem
that was the first experience
i don't like the stylus
it's i mean almost watchable
i'm sorry maybe that'll help
it's okay like it's okay
okay so let's go back
um but they're getting there
i think coleto like three
um it's just not great
will i use this thing
that's my rating of it
there's a SIM card slot
headphone Jack nothing up here
there's a sliding door here
this guy is more stable
you can see we've got
isn't that respect so here
it's a little bit quirky
it's probably a bit more
of course this is over
Word Excel or PowerPoint document
you've attached a laptop dock
it's a pretty large phone
we'll switch to full screen
Express for tablets installed here
I've already done here before
I don't have great handwriting
jetstream have a two button
I'm pricing for that though
I even announced that again
the volume buttons are here
maybe this is for you
it does have a full-size
I'm sure you've seen that
the screen actually looks great
it's gonna be very satisfying
that's cool and it's windows
thanks to the anti-glare finish
major delays in the strokes
let's get some drawing done
my pretty darlings bye bye
hello everyone in today's video
that's inside this zip back
this is a matte surface
and this is the pen
one point six point one
are they all work really
this is my two-year-old girl
Tiffany sleeping on her it
it's also not as smooth
sensitivity doesn't work by default
they are very responsive so
it's always photoshop on windows
you can damage the components
the becky liliana hamentry lauren
cronielson joseph copel clockwork construct
and of course lib libli
I'll be reviewing a spy
he also takes a micro
he has a dual speakers
that's where the speakers are
any further tablet review videos
let's get right into it
we got the tablet itself
it's a little bit lightweight
it has a screen protector
model the artist pro 13.3
the drivers are all familiar
fortunately don't have that here
that's very pleasant to hold
this is a worthy consideration
i'm bad at ending videos
8.2 it's available now on
now what does iboard 10.1
aluminum very stiff very rugged
obviously it's not as portable
the words are fairly small
Nexus runs on that CPU
that's not a bad capacity
says a gig of ram
the zoom was never cheap
10.1 has longer battery life
how much data you use
LT reception this is decent
tablets are generally pretty good
we find those eye board
certainly can help with that
not just because it's bigger
they both feel reasonably fast
not super look at you
my right is redo while
hello everyone in this video
i'll be reviewing this gmac
m70 kids android tablet now
that's pretty installed little pianist
I'm going to be showing
that's not used now though
I quite like the accent
color of that seafoam green
I noticed with this Cintiq
this tablet works really well
8-inch dual core tablet that
it's dual core number two
two megapixel point eight megapixel
it's a great budget tablet
this is the second one
they can't access anything else
so what's actually on there
plus tablet factual books story
books all kinds of things
so i really love that
that makes it really accessible
you've got harry potter there
they weren't like particularly advanced
my four-year-old is quite diddy
put the sd card in
they can only have it
how many hours or minutes
they are built to last
hey guys your own apology
inch screen 32 gigabytes camera
it is a really nice
I'm assuming this is yep
but that's a given considering
USB cable along with this
i played these games along
the speaker is about here
it doesn't matter easy snap
I do quite like that
so that's pretty much it
YouTube works fine streaming fine
I'd fairly happy with it
it runs nice and smooth
we've got some different things
it'd be like really quiet
it's very smooth very clear
Buy it was on special
Wi-Fi running android 5.1 lollipop
it is running android 5.1
how long the battery lasts
you're gonna pay for it
you have your volume rocker
I believe that's a microphone
it's just a 16 gigabyte
the five percent off discount
it didn't have that flexibility
you absolutely can do that
the device is eight hundred
I didn't find the device
help me back from what
bang for your buck anyways
I could find on Amazon
yeah she'd probably like this
we find a user manual
you get a plug-in charger
that's exactly what this did
isn't that bad at all
i said it runs android
it does an adequate job
there's nothing that stands out
hey everyone Leo bond here
you have three main sections
I didn't try them all
I do recommend this thing

I cracked open my custom
we're reviewing the goman m1020
um so here's a pen
it has a nice feel
i must say so guys
is it called dragon touch
here is for the tablet
the tablet uses wire cable
this is the pen stylus
the default pressure works fine
there's no lag at all
I draw the first stroke
so it's on and off
I have contacted the company
it's very smooth this is
this is a finicky photo
works very well here now
I have contacted a company
we have reached 10,000 subscribers

I drew and designed myself
the box is really nice
it's good for portability up

it looks really really sweet.
Some tablet pens these days
This one was another one

a hinge around the hinge
the screen is facing up
let me login a second
it it does feel solid
the deck is actually aluminum
I'm I'm just overdoing it
but this one does not
I I like totally removed
I'm going to tell you
but for most indie games
there's two on this side
not bad at all really
this is a real honest-to-goodness
how are you really cool
this is the power cable
it probably also helps out
lack a lot of detail
so it's nice to see
the tablet have full windows
you did a great job
Lenovo and great job Microsoft
I've got something really exciting
lightweight well balanced and also
let's go to the computer
Express keys the touch here

it's nice and thin overall
there is a trackpad again
you're looking at bluetooth 4.2

I like it even though
it unlocking is quite fast
it shouldn't be an issue
oh here's the pad okay
the shared drive her pistol
this fix was really easy
the tablet was working flawlessly
it worked exactly as intended
so here's a sculpting time-lapse
it's just a feeling that
I can't help but notice
but with that being said

Cupid responsiveness isn't the best
just a reference i think
isn't it only white right
YouTube works great for work

its ears is quite heavy
the belt is absolutely lovely
because that's what they do
though it's addressed to me
they are definitely made because

I've been playing with this
I guess but twenty dollars
it's like it's it's good
there is a special software
before the live you start
thank you the tablet that
the pen design is created
let's see how it works
you need a tablet driver
you've got a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the volume rocker
power button and reset here
it's called to the touch
so that's a pleasant surprise
it doesn't feel too heavy
but what did you expect
that's certainly a good thing
so that's a good thing
doesn't slow down the tablet
even from a tablet perspective
low light shots are bad
look it costs 100 quid
do i recommend this tablet
why even watching this video
max s7000 one tablet price-wise

I do on my phone
But let's be real, right?

that only costs 50 dollars
it is beyond slow apps
take forever to open up
so what can you expect
it's just not very bright
it's a horrible sounding speaker
well it has a camera
the cameras are also horrible
applications are here like netflix
the issue is uh storage
so that's actually really good
not only is it durable
so is it worth it
you make up your mind
Tecla speeds or pittin HD
this makes it extremely fragile
turn out onion soup unusable
here camera is only 5mp

Tecla speed on its d
which one do you want
it's good just say alexa

that seems a bit odd
I'm giving away my setup
there's this really cool tablet
delete get rid of that
let's go through all programs
I'm gonna set that up
that's a really fair comparison
but it's gotta be done
on the operating system windows
this is an absolute breeze
what is not so good

I'm a little bit rusty
it's cheap and it's great
all a brand new released
and on top of it
Giga bytes of system storage
now in terms of battery
fold all the typical products
you just keep adding it
not mixing up with anything
starting with the calculator calendar
let's go into portrait now
another main purpose of me
it's a pretty nice comfortable
it's a high resolution screen
there's still plenty of glare
it it scores about what
have this wireless mouse that
I was good and see

this right here is mute
I don't know Ashley TV
Twitter out there work now
all right there de tank
don't saying you got navigation
I see you for wallpaper
did they not include it
the price is insanely good
US dollars which is crazy
like that's a wonderful price
but it's just one thing
time's that being said had
you really cannot beat it
here's what it sounds like
and here are these speeds
it's actually a single band
we don't have five gigahertz
of course it's 2.4 gigahertz
I'm not too sure so
if you're doing competitive gaming
maybe you can get an
that's some very severe back
and should you get it
it does look pretty nice
which is a good thing
it's not a whole lot
and it's actually very minimal
we only have 2.4 gigahertz
I haven't talked about yet
you've probably already guessed it
it has the old band
i have an xp pen
we had the cover plate
we had all the cables
that stuff doesn't happen anymore
that is really good ergonomics
this is the stylus holder
you can pull it out
so what you could do
this pen is the pa
let's go ahead and see
which is pen tablet right
so you're looking at used
they do get pretty loud
The tablet I paid for.
That’s what I paid for.
Wacom sent me a Cintiq
24 is the perfect size.
They’re too slow, not tactile.
I always keep touch off.
It’s just a C clamp.
You need a decent desk.
It does in fact matter.
It cycles every few seconds.
Is it a driver issue?
But not today. Not yet.
Maybe the driver will update.
programs, or niche programs like
actually really like the design
quite unusual is very thin
nib kind of felt unsteady
there's an option for it
I was really pleasantly surprised
my channel isn't for kids
I'm probably butchering that name
you just pull this thing
I think that's what's called
there might be other functions
it's it's pretty pretty nice
it's there's very little lag
this this is a anti-lgbt
I'm so proud of myself
we have the fill tool
I mean look at this
I loved it so much
Pablo here on the front
I mean back in 2005
I take my brush pen
I assumed you always needed
I'm really impressed by that
I'm using the Dodge tool
I can't really explain them
I don't like that one
I'm working on the hair
yeah that works and then
so you can see it
it feels smooth as butter
it's a little bit noisier
I'm sure what they do
so that's useful but where
sensitivity is controlling the size
it's really easy to do
not exactly what I want
let me make that smaller
and then under mapping what
I got in the gallon
there's a few other features
we can set the fan
let's try getting a brush
it's probably gonna be something
I'll see you next time
but is it any better
which one looks better okay
active pen is sold separately
look at that it's beautiful
presentation makes me feel special
it's uh that's it next
yeah tell us that okay
little pouch for slimmer knives
I assume look at that
that's a nice looking pen
this is kind of painful
Bharti gets by thank you
it looks really really premium
you guys enjoyed this video
this is the artist 12

thank you mom central bye
i have this with me
very reason it's not indestructible
and i have to say
well that won't happen here
well it's called pika going
it could do both solid
that's the only differences there
you can't hear a thing
this is typing whoops test
Reddit or stuff like that
it doesn't have a problem
I do like about this
read it go through whatever
I'm not gonna like it
I've personally ever drawn on
the screen is 11.6 inches
it's not a laminated display
I've used swiping a lot
it's all combined into one
the pen feels incredibly smooth
I just didn't need it
thanks to the flat sided
really well around curves so
this 12 inch form factor
set it on my lap
not right now right now
okay now check this out
they got magazines out there
man uh uh um what
pick one up for yourself
let's get into this now

there's nothing up here okay
what would this be for
don't go find a screwdriver
they got a tactical laser
the falling alley's cool man
this size is really enjoyable
it's really good fun so
let's put it that way
this is a fantastic choice
the contents are the same.
You get the tablet itself.
To test their entertainment features
play store on both models.
sound when you press them
it's a little bit confusing
i didn't experience much lag
also including in the box
Express keys on your tablet
I did not do much
I have to cut everything
it just didn't look how
I forgot to mention before
it's gonna be still white
but it's kind of thin
click on the pen so
I upload a new video
Tech's new top-of-the-line CF 20

it does feel quite hefty
this is the latest dragon
we have a warranty card
it does support stereo music

oh i reload too slow
i thought i was bad
it is small and light
our pen is battery free
there is another protective plastic
which is the deco mini
it is light and portable
it's it's it's quite weird
Android software on this one
it's not great and you
it does the job obviously
I'm happy with the software
we have power switch here
let's look at the sensors

it's sturdy solid and towering
can't override it now personally
this is a review unit
this tablet is very thin
this tablet is supported on
Mac OS and also Windows
let's go into you mapping
I see some issues here
so the shortcut buttons they
are they work really well
alright let's jump to using
I'm using Photoshop on Windows
I hope this is helpful
it must be a victory
so let's start okay guys
this is the press keys
you just can give him
let's start with the unboxing
we can pair it with
Bluetooth there is no NFC
not that you're gonna use
quality is like 5 megapixels
I did the video test
it's really clean and simple
it's really nice and soft
it's filled with some papers
if that happens to you
let's see how it is
it's the texture you know
see what else we have
we have a user manual
so we'll put that aside
that would not be fun
canada india uk united states
it's quite a few okay

I'm just gonna open up
got another ps1 game here
over the fire eight HD
I really appreciate you watching
shall we alright first up
one is a bit strange
the pen is pretty decent
the tablet feels quite solid
I'd say it's three point
seven five out of five
we've all been waiting for
let's go cool cool here
we have the display tablet
what else do we have
what else do we have
usually with my pen tablets
which tablet are you using
um so light so pretty
there were some weird blobs
Pro is fantastic as is.
I’ve scratched tablets this way.
Uninstall any old tablet drivers.
The tablet is somewhat insensitive.
But you adapt to it.
In Photoshop this is great.
right, try clicking that button.
That wraps up this review.
I have used so far.
that is a boss toe
go straight into your laptop
and you're good to go
I have not personally before
Bosto 8,192 pressure levels pen
the tablet recognizes the pen
prices will change so definitely
that's not a problem either
that's for sure now overall
we have a reset button
you're having a wonderful day
here are the top buttons
Heuer and website in particular
I'm bit of an elitist
I love my display tablets
I've used that a lot
that's a different book altogether
I'm trying to make is
it makes a huge difference
this is just a map
this thing is only $79.99
go check out my videos
which isn't a good thing
there is a dialer app
Alcatel 310 tablet as always
it's good bye for now
watch boom there you go
I like what Lenovo is
the pricing structure is great
two to three thousand dollars.
Which is significantly more affordable
Oh! This is the reveal.
Here's the actual grand review.
We have the Cintiq itself.
And we have the pen.
Where you plug it in?
This is a one-stop shop.
Milo, what time is it?
[Milo] It's color dodge time!
Aw man, here we go.
Give me an ice attack!
The response time was quick.
Look at all that sun.
this tablet is pretty amazing
so let's let's see how
CD is it this one
let's sing a chord okay
you can't see you nicely
there's this row of button
you'll feel the line okay
so you've got eight buttons
I have so far now
okay now using this time
mix-up oh no s 640
you hit a small one
okay you just need to
okay now if let's say
it's a hand tool so
it's a tablet review so
so that's it for this
I will say so far
okay it's so small that
we'll see you next time
who's a cute widow's queen
it's a pretty good upgrade
Hey guys, how's it going!
And they gave me this..
Ooo you see my reflection?
Look at all this stuff.
We'll test it out later.
Oh! I'm using it backwards.
I figured this out, guys.
tablets is with the details.
So I'm gonna try that.
Just to give a comparison.This
I absolutely loved this glove.
It was like so smooth.
Huh? Do you breathe fire?
it wasn't very big files
the screen is very shiny
the pen squeaks really slightly
don't get me wrong the
I think it's exceptionally good
yes because of today's smartphones
the u.s. still use experienced
thanks to the large screen
see you and thank you
it's really good all right
we have this usb cable
there is no pen stand
and here at the side
all these physical shortcut buttons
this pen is very sensitive
i'm using the usbc adapter
no driver installation is required
it's going to be disorienting
it is worth mentioning that
thanks very much for listening
that sounds really great here
it's actually pretty well built
you do have a card
it didn't work on here
the color on the display
Word here running on it
I've got a Bluetooth keyboard
be book v3 ultra book
I like the build quality
I think you'll be fine
might you'll definitely need that
let's check this one out.
and you might ask me
the pen feels very light.
the pen is battery free
oh wow look at that
definitely not the swimming pool
you're using you can edit
that's who you on did
they are very nice people
it's definitely a speed improvement
RAM so yeah the speed
get rid of the reflections
OS layout got the apps
you can move stuff around
I like about the tablet
I got a different tutorial
you can use tuning radio
Alexa the virtual assistant features
this thing called word runner
it wasn't on by default
so there's this adaptive brightness
hey what's going on guys
welcome back to another video
there's not much to it
tablet is not too bad
the rock button charging port
we have the stereo speakers
i do like that detail
so let's turn it on
we can see it here
let's play some titles here
yeah not too bad guys
we're playing with standard graphics
i think it's pretty responsive
another thing i find helpful
I do like that size
I don't like anything smaller
so you'll be supporting me
its gesture control is fine
so we finally have it
and what are we getting
glass covered full hd screen
not that most people mind
i am sure of it
you'll find two loudspeakers here
it's starting to then change
this screen is really good
internal storage speeds quite slow
does it bottleneck the system
this is a low score
look at the weak area
well away from my router
you don't actually see this
the screen is looking pretty
that is a lot lighter
that's not a huge lemon
it's a more premium model
let's just get into it
it just worked cool beans
you know what they say
the pen pressure is good
this is a good choice
i just want to mention
it's deeply personal to me
but finding your way back
let me know that too
it's definitely a lot smoother
the screen is 10.1 inches
time is a little slow
there is a pogo port
it scratched our camera on
this is our sim tray
do it a lot better
wait a little bit heavier
this still isn't perfect okay
scroll down to the bottom
maximum brightness will quickly show
that's what it's 50% brightness
a game will take that
that definitely would take last
Netflix is and standard definition
you will not have full
accuracy of two meters now
GPS but it actually works
last t30 is pretty good
I found with some games
what you're listening to is
okay so just to recap
I'll start with the positives
that is really really good
not the tablet for it
it's just still not perfect
ok you don't see major
we have the full court
Ram 8 or 16 gigs
so what they give you
they weigh about 2.8 pounds
when you're talking about lenovo
performance is nice on this
so that was pretty impressive
the back will get warm
so surface pro is notoriously
the trackpad is pretty good
Pro though is the fact
hello camera yeah not often
that's gone because Thunderbolt 3
LTE module on the side
obviously it's got some glare
Pro Challenger in that respect
this one has really good
display tablet is incredibly affordable
it's annoying pass the calibration
the tablet and the pan
I have to say that
I need a new computer
Talbot came with a stand
this one is good enough
it doesn't have any face
today's news scrolls pretty good
i didn't notice any lag
we can only use balanced
it doesn't look too bad
the game is definitely playable
i noticed for the camera
also isn't that bad either
quality is also really good
thank you guys for watching
hey everyone in today's video
XP pen in this video
what the driver can do
yes this tablet actually supports
so this is the tablet
they will also light up
nice very solid and now
this is not very useful
there is actually the functionality
this is the mapping area
you should choose reset customer
it's really sensitive very responsive
so it's not too slippery
they give you different versions
no driver installation is required
I'm quite impressed by this
I'll be showing you guys
I've had for ages anyway
D tablet was working pretty
I got into the painting
so what is this thing
it's a pen display basically
if you really wanted to
you could take it off
it has a standard release
I've never seen that before
it's pretty comfortable to hold
I'm not getting any fish
I often do even appropriate
straightener turned on the higher
you set the stroke straightener
that doesn't have that problem
I know that sounds strange
I hope it was okay
okay text you later bye
Caesar people totally like Brutus
I'm reviewing the Delmont PD
this tablet is pretty big
it doesn't become completely flat
it makes me feel secure
okay so coming to price
I really love the size

I hope it's not mobile

I'm at the wireless spot
okay so you get it
this one is no problem
you may consider this tablet
I'm looking at the Toshiba
Tegra Nvidia processor built in
you know obviously navigation so
it is a good tablet
just not the sexiest thing
I'm doing it for charity
we'll speak to you soon
it looks good um again
watch this see that see
I'm mostly okay with that
okay moving on to audio
it's it's really whatever when
let me launch something else
that's probably the reason why
it's a very old crap
I I couldn't believe it
do i recommends this tablet
put it that way alright
that's it for this review
let's talk about the hardware
this is much more convenient
they are programmed for photoshop
the light will stay on
this is tablet driver version
I'm using a 4k monitor
this is the mapping area
that comes with the pen
yes there is the bottom
especially the pen display monitors
so this is pretty standard
tablet looks fine with mischief
Wacom tablet at this size
yo like this video now
Welcome driver from their website
this is only really cool
I've actually used a tablet
that isn't a display so
there is no power cable
it's not it's not heavy
you can't really beat it
we're gonna talk about that
going back to the p0
you go for the g6
wait for it to finish
its finishes are very well
this is something like that
which was a big plus
See what I did there?
I wouldn't even bother trying.
Now let's discuss the pen.
Adobe Fresco is coming soon.
They're offering six months license
Android compatibility means the Wacom
And now for some comparisons.
And now for the price.
The pros of the Wacom
And now for the cons.
And now for my conclusion.
I'm also happy to see
there is like no lag
it's really accurate you know
there's no blockiness it's not
that's one of the reasons
I find they super useful
this is a review unit
we have the warranty card
the design feels quite solid
it's towards the lighter side
buttons have a nice quicky
and this is that tablet
the corners are rounded off
we have this red color
I have already assigned mine
the pen is very sensitive
they are really quite smooth
let me show you how
well the line is tapered
we see some marks here
I like the pen case
I hope this is helpful
that one is not supported
I tried is a new
yes not great for multitasking
you can play most games
it has the same 10.1
around it are quite big
a tablet has two speakers
it's certainly fine for watching
YouTube Netflix and Amazon video
let's check out some alternatives
hey everyone in today's video
this is a review unit
we have this nice pattern
can you see the pattern
is dot matrix pattern here
these are the different functions
let's take a look at
Krita same thing pressure works
delete the wind tab drivers
I'm reviewing the Samsung ativ
inch tablet that runs full
oh it better be given
like a little click pad
that doesn't happen so well
the display is 10.1 inches
it also gets very bright
it's got an octa-core processor
oh that's an old one
we go this is one
we've also got some photos
let's pop into Google Chrome
also sea winds mister vlogger
it's a very robust tablet
I really do appreciate it
I also forgot to mention
when you get everything reattached
kickstand so on the surface
this one sits more flat
it really does lay flat
this is a ThinkPad keyboard
I was expecting a louder
but it does sound okay
a graphical processor too heavily
I've got a blu-ray MKV
i've been thanks for watching
you can take it places
I made a few errors
six pro tablet that runs
this is a quad-core CPU
I don't really like about
that comes with this device
definitely go for it alright
the viewing angles are good
they don't sound that great
tablet is probably not ideal
the battery life on it
so keep that in mind
the battery life isn't great
Tablet companies target well-known artists,
email lists and social media.
Giveaways are worse than reviews.
Never agree to test tablets.
You have the power here.
the note is on display
that's included with the unit
touch responsiveness is very good
here is the s-pen slot
I try to scroll here
Samsung wants to change that
you just have more precision
we hope you like this
numbers come by the site
Windows 10 your Lynx vision
it looks really good on
it's very similar to the
Xbox elite rubberized grips now
just doesn't feel quite right
this is a great solution
the battery lasts very well
it has plenty of power
you can do your gallery
so let's say for example
okay that's that max volume
taken on this tablet overall
SD card slot actually works
this is at maximum brightness
you get a lot less
we're in the bookstore view
that's a much better presentation
take a look at multimedia
you control is slightly complicated
it looks like you poked
HDMI USB C microphone headphone
picks up fingerprints pretty easily
let's look at the bezels
it's not the best again
most of them are better
the screen has noticeably yellowed
and this actually does help
as you can see here
this is very well optimized
it's pretty much as whoops
there are times that multitasking
so there's that's not good
the performance is not bad
I am impressed with it
I really wouldn't recommend it
hey guys what's going on
it has dual sim capabilities
I shouldn't have to note
this would be quite good
I'll see you same time
hello shoppers for today's video
jack and a sim tray
apps to test the tablet
your goal to destroy it
it doesn't produce smooth lines
then let's go here in
anddd there's a black box
let's open it soooo here
the tablet won't be damaged
just like the 10-inch yoga
IPS LCD s in general
but it's still pretty good
it's also running lenovo's own
you really can't go wrong
I'll just turn it off
I'm not that keen on
I really like that screen
considered is 1280 by 800
you can go for gadget
it's not on other devices
it feels quite nicely made
we're getting a desktop class
the tablet feared surprisingly high-end
but the frame is unprotected
sure it might be because
it's quite bright with 400
nits and it's readable outside
let's check out the alternatives
so let's do an unboxing
let's peel off the plastic
he's a chill little guy
what else in the box
it's got a little usb
this is the pen itself
it's not a chargeable pen
yeah it's a three-in-one cable
the response is really nice
the pressure is really nice
it was just on occasion
it's very it's very sleek
i'll see you again sometime
so it's an octa-core processor
it's not a glass screen
the back is that's metal
it's a little bit tinny
that's coming through those speakers
but reduce it in size
nice and quick to charge
it's a pretty cheap quality
I already set it up
so that's a good sign
so that's a positive thing
let's talk about the cameras
well it's looking pretty good
it's a two megapixel camera
and 5 gigahertz networks also
that's a full-size USB port
you also get right here
let's turn the volume up
it's playing it absolutely fine

it is with the pen
yeah so that is adequate
write the traditional ink right
I'm I'm fine with it
I mean for a prototype
so the front display sheet
so yeah alright come on
that couldn't be more true
thirteen is a pen display
it's just a fancy-pants monitor
inch display to be exact
and that's what this pen
all you need is creativity
it comes in three colors
this is a laminated screen
there are two drawing gloves
I have cables like that
it requires a special cable
I couldn't test those either
Android devices over on who
go for it have fun
who would have thought that
that's because renova is shipping
speaking of the headphone jack
the sound quality is bad
it was fine for everybody
it's not a top performer
MTN were 21 quad-core processor

the keyboard is really nice
the build quality is amazing
this has that dual tone
I think it looks amazing
I think these sound amazing
they actually work really well

I well that I've noticed
Nikolaas screen so once again

it's a little bit slimmer
I come in this video
it's a port convertible tablet
so it's a convertible slice
it's not getting too hot
a data only SIM card
it's really very nice tablet
it actually balances quite well

it's priced at 549 dollars
we have an empty slot
there's no extra widgets here

that's ballpark for a Tegra
you're definitely good to go
because it's so darn thin
you can see the standard
speakers are actually pretty good
quality on the rear camera
given how thin and light
comm here with the first
netbook sized keyboard really cramped
this is the Windows Metro
this tablet the reason why

Photoshop is two input lag
it's it to support cute
Lenovo tap is seven review

this is a major upgrade
the specification is pre beast
gigs of free internal memory
the side vessels are small

this are just absolutely gorgeous
you've got your standard home
you might just find that
this was just created before
Ridge and slightly raised buttons
I didn't notice very much
but is it any good?
Performance is impressive as Windows
There are pluses and minuses
to this, for example battery
release and the illusion shatters.
Like button if you enjoyed!
uh collagen so 120 tablets
and i'm gonna little guys
looks like in real life
the colors are fairly vibrant
it has both bluetooth version
tablets that use non-flash mediums
thanks to its hdmi connection
which is great for presentations
we will be testing this
I think it's a point
I do graphic design SketchBook
I read some reviews online
M chips chipset based computers
comparative is the asus ux305
that has the same chip
these keyboards are very low
the windows button is here
all the hardware decisions aside
M processor has been something
they don't sound very good
real quick is pop open
but you'll get a computer
hey what is up guys
has some pretty beastly specs
grill is the front-facing camera
tablet running almost pure stock
but you've probably experienced yourself
Nexus tablet with front-facing speakers
do you get more power
become a rocket so yes
that problem is completely gone
that's more than three words
it works whatever the reason
I have the first version
that's it other than that
we'll be looking at this
it's a brand new model
it's time to get started
it's a pretty good tablet
we want the picker tool
fill that in anywhere else
it's not amazing is it
uh bucket fill that one
whoa really easy there okay
so that's it from me
see you later bye you
what is what and then
different languages that is also
it's really nice doesn't slide
it's really comfy to hold
the front-facing camera is 480p
you don't need anything else
it's a pretty decent device
I wanted to touch on
10 is Amazon's newest tablet
the most obvious is size
the camera is also different
hello a couple weeks ago
the answer is priced the
that's none of that online
I'm used to working with
seems like on my old
I want to touch upon
own rep who said yeah
it's really cool drying up
the pen is battery free
it's much much more natural
i really do appreciate it
i'll see you next time
this tablet has 3 programmable
Wii on pin tablet driver
it never became fully functional
that is the bet aside
I found myself getting lost
remember the active area on
I recommend it to beginners
so there is another option
it should be this week
i'll talk to you soon
i did confirm from them
i'm gonna leave it here
love you peace so you
hello this is simason corner
you need to get started
p80x does have this capability
what do these numbers mean
hello this is simracing nice
you'll need for this level
i'm sorry for this complication
it is a winning combination
and this is the sony
they are living by that
read news surf the web
check my email with this
which is you know boring
that was a big problem
which is a new game
we go deletion the reason
I can change the size
they could make it thinner
they could make it lighter
it's just incremental improving something
I use it every day
I use it when traveling
i usually run at home
you can get more round
I can play two games
and that's a big game
it's running the 801 chipset
I'm looking forward to that
you might be saying well
I'm not going to lie
yeah we have the back
I shouldn't chose that one
thanks for the set up
it's kind of like oh
you know something like that
so yeah it's very cool
let's go back to there
every single one of those
well look at some sunglasses
3000 milliamp battery is gigantic
we're wrapping up here so
I don't really like that
sorry for the long video
it's not like normal tablets
it feels quite spacious gama
it comes with a stand
which are the common colors
it hasn't changed at all
it has 8,192 pressure levels
you're gonna need them because
have more wires than this
do we sell the tablet
I really really like this
because that's the only thing
I made so many mistakes
it looks a little creepy
that's it for this video
headers for a stock card
that's it for this episode
thanks again for watching everyone
hi my name is Ashley
obviously this is a latitude
not happy to answer them
then this second button here
let's see how this goes
I already redesigned S&T twice
this is her modern version
here's a character design tip
voila the sketch is done
I started with the basics
and here's the final product
working fairly decently from what
this is a $399 tablet
we're gonna unbox it galette
pinky boo do the unboxing
what comes that little hard
we go there we go
yeah let's see here so
chargin okay lots of wires
this is the wacom one
this is my 13-inch Cintiq
it's close to get sturdy
compare this to the 13-inch
and then look at this
they had laptops of mind
Wacom which is good right
you can definitely you know
so let's um let's pick
so they're your real pencil
is that the stylus on
they'd be here neither ways
no pressure no pressure chalk
she looks like she's from
it's definitely for the money
Wacom tablet I recommend it
thanks so much for watching
I've been enjoying the experience
I was watching after that
I hope that changes soon
Alexa to function and annoyingly
I'm at Erin lyy see
hello and welcome together media
I'm grant Abbott and today
maybe students maybe as students
it's very comfortable to use
so let's talk input methods
i will mention the lenovo
let's talk about the speakers
i have so i guess
lenovo does include a little
the price point is awesome
it's a nice little tablet
HDMI and a mini USB
what you're used to using
it's quite small and compact
I'd say this is just
I'm thinking they're getting one
we were the larger keys
whichever you like alright guys
oh and by the way
I go into the child
but it's only about two
this is a child's tablet
just go through all those
I didn't get it right
obviously expandable with the micro
USB card micro SD card
it wasn't perfect at all
so that's what i did
i think it turned out
what makes this tablet really
it has a 1 gigahertz
this is actually the exact
lepen is actually a manufacturer
there's nothing on the bottom
and it's easy to read
which is another counterintuitive aspect
it's a very impressive display
the barnes & noble devices
Vudu app so last year
that's not looking too bad
I'm probably gonna regret this
Squarespace makes that super easy
I was a bad noise
this is the tiniest tablet
so we've got our tablet
my hand was pretty tired
is that the screen protector
just rub them out man
you just select the button
I am unworthy of this
let's take a quick look
this wheel is quite nice
it does feel pretty good
this one's a bit tricky
tablet rather than display tablet
it's just all fairly obvious
so it's it's quite compatible
this tablet came with you
I tested out replacing one
the colors looked very similar
I'm using a default Photoshop
this is a drawing monitor
the pen didn't work correctly
that's what's helped me overall
I really like the tablet
I didn't have any problems
and here's the front camera
google don't hit the bomb
i'm gonna do super slam
the tablet plugged in directly
thank you for 50 subscribers
click on the driver tab
it's always set to left
the tablet will randomly freeze
let's talk about the cable
I will do a live
leave a like and subscribe
hello everyone a long time
this is the power adapter
this is a pen charger
it comes with four screws
I'm recording with one hand
I call a power adapter
it just goes into it
not a pen display tablet
and here is my review
you should also realize that
smart tablet is your choice
this is the Samsung Galaxy
this is an ideal solution
it just weighs 467 grams
because even at max volume
have a look at this
Samsung Galaxy Tab s 10.5
this is the week 15
let me just this side
it's very simple and clean
I like the rounded corners
it looks very slick alright
Windows ink on or off
I may reduce the brush
they also respond to pressure
I don't see any jitter
this is also very responsive
it's very responsive and pressure
I expect them to so
this is a drunk tablet
alright so thanks for watching
It won’t work below that.
Those only work on computers.
Install. Plug your tablet in.
you can run it perfectly
Samsung has dropped a magazine
it's a to be answered
so i'd seen something recently
game glass maps the controls
it's quite a chunky tablet
it's very good for multimedia
but you can see here
it's really nice and smooth
the sound quality isn't brilliant
it handles all basic tasks
lets you easily write notes
hello everyone in this video
I'm going to be unboxing
the box is the tablet
I was super happy about
I hope you enjoyed it
hope to see you soon
thanks to the proprietary widgets
I like Samsung's tablets though
it's got a really nice
you do have a headset
Courtney uh who are you
let's crack open this tablet
so it's about high time
so here's the final product
it has a smooth surface
enjoy the speed paint first
but guess you couldn't count
the pressure sensitivity was working
this is the packaging box
quality disk feels very sturdy
the finishing is very nice
I would say quite good
they were not there when
there are two buttons here
there are eight replacement nibs
it's a very small receiver
there could be some issues
Photoshop cs5 on the Mac
this is a drawing app
pressure works is very smooth
there is no lack lines
Pro pressure works no lack
all right here is where
so let me try that
so this is quite frustrating
it just does not work
let me try rotating anti-clockwise
but not so with this
Crete R or not work
I'm not too sure so
these are the apps that
our affinity photo and designer
let me summarize for you
the build quality is excellent
that's all for today's review
hi guys welcome back today
you're getting a tablet with
i think you should consider
if you're looking for one
it's got a headphone jack
But without further ado folks.
Let's dive into today's video
You can create notes now
You can have dotted notes
I like journaling on paper
beforehand is definitely more accurate
just take note into that
I'm very impressed with this
and if you have one
it's like a real pen
whenever you push on it
thanks for watching this review
shout out to my boy

the big quality is ok
I'm not speaking for Samsung
you can install them yourself
hello everyone my name is
the report rate is 265
I really do like it
let's see this glove again
I think that's about it
the pressure is absolutely astounding
it is 100% worth it
I've seen much smaller town
and don't get me wrong
a pen with 9 amps
but it's worth mentioning again
you would feel absolutely horrendous
tail killed rather than herself
and that japheth are inflamed
if everyone else believes it
it's also none of that
the quality is absolutely amazing
the n1 is an aluminum
the back surface is smooth
one thing that I found
you'll notice some color bleeding
that is still in beta
I will have no problems
i'm kevin the tech ninja
let's get started xp pen
and this is mini 7w
but this is wireless deco
this is about 60 us
this video is not sponsored
build buttons on the tablet
this is the usb-c cable
it's a really good quality
cable guys i like it
i will start with pros
the tablet surface is great
it is matte and matte
it's actually a good idea
if you have any questions
keep watching mathematics goodbye you

okay you can control it
you can change your password
where's the map you know
I can take pictures here
I forgot to set press
yes just bear with it.
the box quality is excellent
that's what they are claiming.
you also get a pen
you also get a manual
but it's not a cd.
this time in the box
mwhich was kind of odd.
this was a true joy
this might cause an issue.
you can't really get those.
what is going on guys
no buttons at the top
I don't think so no
maybe you're into consuming media
I have my home button
I'll load up my Greg
of course like i said
it's an actual glass surface
which is very very nice
this is a desktop device
that would bother me it
the drivers will completely crash
that's a little bit better
is this a good purchase
essentially is a mini computer
i'll see you next foreign
hey everyone in today's video
$30 this is the tablet
tablet design is pretty straightforward
I like the rounded corners
Wacom Intuos step was released
there are 4 shotgun buttons
this is a braided cable
so on one end this
I'm using a 27-inch monitor
looks pretty smooth to me
this is me teabag paint
I hope this is helpful
it's very thin this board
it's not even that hard
we got a rocker switch
now cross the top here
it stopped flashing at me
so that's the back button
I'm hovering over to right-click
use it for my job
select your free bundle software
have you know stroke modify
I find really quite tricky
this is clip studio paint
let's draw with a pen
I'm not really quite sure
this is really quite amazing
you've got spendings in there
Wacom thing across the top
there's no webcam reset button
that's sort of your default
have everything looked too tiny
this is the h 610
some people collect action figures
the build is good enough
it's calibrated pretty well too
their tap opal shortcut keys
it's a little bit textured
Windows or on a Mac
there is one major caveat
thank you guys for watching
you can practice your line
i think it's quite good
that's right for 900 rupees
they can practice their equations
this is a handy feature
this is a good feature
this is a good addition
yeah and one more thing
I'm using the first feature
that cure is a good
this is a spacebar so
so it's just my opinion
I thought was really cool
it is $119.99 u.s. dollars
which is really really great
it's about the same weight
extractors built into the stand
it'll never fall out so
I feel like the paper
texture gives it good resistance
I think it will suffice
let's just peel off the
what's also kind of neat
I can also do multitasking
hello everyone in this video
it's a Samsung Galaxy Tab
Android tablet now this tablet
it's a decent mid-range tablet
is you can see that
the logos at the top
and the power button okay
that's how the tablet looks
we were resolution of 1920
MJ we've to give them
I like about this tablet
hey guys in today's video
tablet and any display tablet
that is worth checking out
a look at the back
we can see the specifications
that's right underneath it like
I like it up next
it is lighter than the
keep that in mind next
so the press keys again
I was actually really surprised
Bub's new face and larceny
but it's an ergonomic nightmare
are they worth your money
it's hard to write that
SD card slot for expandable
it's pretty jittery at times
it's that you get stock
it's pretty darn inexpensive dare
thanks for watching hands-on tech
hello everyone in today's video
this is a review unit
that doesn't have a display
eight replacement nibs are included
and that's the nip remover
two adapters to help you
so this is the tablet
the design is very simple
this is the side profile
there are 16 soft keys
it's very accurate and predictable
they work really well personally
this is krita on windows
let's do the test again
it's really worth the money
it's a very good buy
I like the screen resolution
I would say an easier
the screen is the battery
I found the Wi-Fi connection
this is a third-party tablet
it's not the thinnest tablet
we have our volume rocker
we also have a mini
we've got our rear camera
one of them is called
which is actually really nice
we're gonna load another game
I think we'd be okay
I'm really happy with that
there wasn't any graphical issues
I just enjoyed the gameplay
I did try to run
the game felt really good
I have Dragon Ball Z
it's $89.99 for the plus
they've kept the headphone jack
it's a pretty decent display
we do get dual band
Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime YouTube
we're getting a good framerate
Fire HD 8 plus and
I mentioned in this video
it's still worth the price
i love the first one
they just come like this
I can only be used
Lots sort of extreme tests
I hope that was helpful
I make that helps people
they all seem to say
its claim out myself since
let's get to the unboxing
I'm just gonna go ahead
you can figure it out
he's just a nice easy
the tablet works pretty much
you're using by the time
its grateful undergo work though
I haven't had problems running
I'll show you you know
make these kind of things
it could actually be interesting
this thing is very beefy
I'll call it 12 inches
it's got a quad core
a thousand in that's what
you can still see it
if you have to do
it's not the lightest thing
SSD anywhere from 128 gigs
onboard performance is just fine
ice-like isn't so super huge
it has an anti-glare surface
it looks kind of grainy
that's what that's for again
you can get a charger
so there's a thank you
it's a very large tablet
the buttons are all right
they are easy to press
took it at an angle
you can just pull up
now this is the dollars
let's start using the apps
I just want to demonstrate
this is a sheath pressure
works here quite nicely too
I'm using MIDI Bank paint
Troy pressure looks very well
it works fine another thing
so you actually still need
that's all for today's review
she is quite the looker
it just looks really nice
pull the pen out here
so it's very very light
but the buttons feel good
oh that's a zoom okay
the material is feel smooth
I think it's really good
that's what I'm using here
let's jump into the video
is this chord right here
what's inside of the package
it's in two different layers
I'm gonna walk you through
should it wear out then
you need to replace it
what's inside of this donut
this is actually the Pakistan
can you tell the difference
in addition to whatever tablet
ready to undo whatever mistake
Hui on in to us

but yeah not that great
the screen is fully laminated
I was able to read
Play Store you will notice
which is most of them
yeah on the back here
recommend that and then if
they were missed you know
you really do need this
it is through the recovery
I don't know it is
a bill fato crypto tag
backup for all of them
so you definitely need these
sending me this hardware wallet
it's a very good display
as a high resolution display
1.35 millimeters of key travel
HDMI port USB 3.0 port
even just shooting this video
Excel that sort of thing
bunny neither is it a
it's just a little unpredictable
yeah that's always nice from
something that's expensive is surface
it doesn't look too small
so if you drop it
you've got a hdmi port
which can stream full 1080p
it's a super vibrant screen
it's really nice and crisp
I'll really fix up this
catch you guys next time

we'll play need that comfort
it also has that mi
this hinge is very stiff
it offers a great experience
that goes into the side
I still want to mention
let's say you're editing video
maybe you're a business professional
but with the x1 tablet
it does have stereo speakers
nothing spectacular out of this
it's not all that invasive
Tom Albrecht Brian Parker in
I'm guessing all cables all
it's rhett and test it
let me have a look
that's plastic not meat over
shut that over there so
you hold the camera focus
put that over there battery
