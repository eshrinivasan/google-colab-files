we often a stack with the
the same goes for touch with
he just won two years ago

what we've noted here however
s4 in the rear view
make sure you stop by hot
thanks for stopping by
uk tech review channel

it's a rather nice box
that's it now
this tablet here
this isn't a 4g lte tablet
it's heavy metal back
well we'll give it a 5.
it's it's acceptable
it's not particularly snappy
it's fine
i think the processor
i suppose
it's the same
uh it's got a six thousand
milliamp battery is fast
six at tops
i think that's pretty average
it's okay it's not good
you know it's full android 9.
it does a job
it's got a nice bright screen
nicely built um you know
that does the job then
bye for now
it's great for drawing
then you get the cable
it's without a battery
it came down to two tablets
I clicked something there

now one issue with that
is that the
GT 190 that I've used
I don't have any issue now
I like it
I wouldn't worry about it
I think that's just fine now
I don't use them
this doesn't have it
it's pretty pretty awesome
it's just a little
which is very nice
now the one thing
maybe that's how
I'm using it

Google's a quick draw web app

I'm um I'm opening the box
there's the tablet
it's a very small tablet
also up here
you have the pen
oh that's a good
it's super simple
and so yeah
and that's what this is
let me touch it
let me touch me
yeah this thing right here
this black bit over here
here you see behind me
it is a monitor it lights up
I have ever held
industrial design nice
osoo which is a kind of a
it's got a report rate of 200
because it's so small
this is very inexpensive
I know Coppa
try it out
see what you like
i mean i just love it
i'm gonna
i play asphalt 9
uh with about anything
i mean
it's fast you see
how fast that came up
look how fast that loads
isn't that unbelievable
that's really good
that's really nice
music is really good
i mean for that size
it sounds really nice
even my netflix
i mean it there it it doesn't
it's just seamless
it runs really smooth
that's fast
i'm really impressed with it
really happy with it
that's just awesome
it is 4.7 millimeters thin
the experience is nice for me
experience is quite accurate
i'm not that neat
you are in the minority
it still caters to that now
all these features
be in one place overall
it's 400 pounds
like one is my diary
it's a normal tablet
it's a normal tablet
it's a lot and it is nice
i really like the fix tablet
it is cheap
so you would see it's a basic
it's very basic
that will fix
you can see that
i'm going to use skyfire
now it's just loading here
okay there we go okay
I guess
their is no flash again
this is the issue
we believe 1600 megahertz
let's go back to home page
we go again
okay page now
and that's very disappointing
it is very limited
that's one thing
i loaded up
the the onyx is much faster
they have the exact same ink
it has a lot of ghosting
ghosting problems on the onyx
so let's talk about the text
they have a boldness option
different color on the onyx
it didn't work very well
i mean so
it's linux based
you can install on this
image viewer app
thank you guys for watching
ok go cut the other side
that's pretty much it
oh oh the whole box comes out
yeah as you can see you
of course um oh this far
we got the books
the tablet itself okay so
I got this plastic
Oh son of a okay
it's like so so got the back
that is okay
that's how far it goes
wow it sounds weird but yes
it's the tab itself before
display of 800 by 1280
we also have a 0.3
we got the microphone
where are your apps are at
we also have the mute option
let me start shop
okay as you can see here
it's pretty good actually
it will heat up
but is it really worth $80
hello internet world
this is the dragon
it's got a 10.1
and that is purely
no sort of bloatware
we're at mid brightness
i think it is an ips display
really cool indeed
so that's really nice
so some nice texture there
of course then
it's a really nice experience
so that's it for the review
so do tune in for that
hi guys welcome on
Silk Road Channel today
ok let's start inside box
but that's not a big deal
hope you enjoyed the video
hi everyone
they fear leader
I'm so sorry
I wish it could be
but that's just the way
the shipping fees work
unfortunately inside the box
it looks awesome
they're extremely helpful
it's also super impressive
it's something that
it works absolutely perfectly
thank you to
thank you to who yawns
this is an entry-level
the tablet is 10 inches
Play and things like that
it could do everything I want
I used when I did the line
I'd prefer a rechargeable pen
didn't need to
it really didn't bother me
I added more layers
you can download apps
it's not going to replace my
I think it's really good
it was nice to work on
what's happening everyone
that are wondering
i feel the screen looks great
we have a 3.5 mil audio jack
we have two speakers
so let's hear that is hello
this is a quick example
that we have
so for example
i've tried facebook on it
i've tried the browser
call of duty works
it's um found your location
it doesn't seem um to lose it
it has a 10.1 inch screen
it's known as a smart stylus
it's not an extra battery
that's not a good sign
this is a dual-core
CPU at one
RAM at 21
these are my fingerprints
PCIe mode the only time
you so here
first up
specific game
720p low settings
and that's minecraft
there's not a lot of
she can get on YouTube
I had right out of the box
I would skip it
thanks for watching you
stuck at home me too
we all are social distancing
I get to work from home
the kids are home
it still works
I'm such a bad liar
okay and look at that
it's already set up for me
that's a pretty unboxing
I actually have some time
IPS display
we've got dual speakers
they look the same
I swapped out my trusty
it's got a strong build
its hefty
it feels good and solid
it's just my fear of change
like subscribe comment the
ask and you shall receive
the ink pad is using the same
you will see that
it is very apparent it
this is the exact same shot
we did see in our tear down
you don't want it too dark
you can sideload in your own
they look very very nice
they look nearly identical
there's no spillage
the sunken screen
it's irrelevant
we covered the three basics
the pdfs reading and manga
be it a composite
be it plastic
this is peter
Keogh matrix pad s8 edition
OH matrix patent s8 review
now i like that form factor
i like its versatility
hey everybody it's andrew
i'm not being paid by lenovo
i did not receive a review
my unit cost 1187.40
now keep in mind
let's open it up now
i like that now
taking a look at the keyboard
i'm really impressed with it
that's good to see
not too loose
a little bit larger display
this is an excellent keyboard
all right
let's check out
what a disaster
there's my green screen
gotta say that all right
let's check out that display
it's actually pretty gorgeous
its own right now
it does get bright at 390
good white points
it also covers the color
gamut really
that's not the case
and that's thanks to that
and that's really fast now
let's wrap it all up
thinkpad x12 detachable
i absolutely love it
it really works
i really liked it a lot
the x12 detachable
i really like it
it's a bright display
please share this video
let me know how i'm doing
I like the key
what's new is in sigh
quick editor's note
cheaper are still valid
you get the tablet itself
a bit light for me personally
nice feel to it
honest is quite nice
i really like the surface
do make this tablet stand out
keys is a form over function
the drawing surface is really
ui is pleasing and intuitive
that's difficult to describe
i like the tablet
what you're searching for
the drivers are reliable
the buttons feel nice
anyways a big
hi everyone this is teo from
is this pot here
this is the metallic back
I have tried from 3 on
CD is pancakes
is that a charging cable
this is a very solid pen case
this is the remover
the red light will show up
this is very smooth
I'm using Mac
these are Chinese words
I think is a good choice
screw-ups cool down
just dial it up or down
the default value is fine
V Photoshop cs5 on the Mac
this isn't very smooth
I cannot be any of you
NT it was quite bad
cs5 pressure works very well
this is MIDI Bank pinch
there is no lack here
it doesn't work with me
so that's the problem here
it works quite well
Windows as well
illustrator is three sketches
I think it's a good choice
thanks for watching
I hope this video is helpful
hi this is
it's got android 4.4
jack microphone and micro
that was available
Internet issues here
we go and in terms of video
I'm having internet issues
it's not dual-band

Android KitKat really
hey guys so today
it feels pretty sturdy
Bend it's nice
it was really nice
we have the pan

all right okay
this is a driver
I noticed right off
I found it quite nice
I'm right-handed myself
you can do anything light
I have two two monitors

I use both monitors all right
it feels good
that require a tablet
it works really well
hey guys it's me
in today's video
it's the vague vk1200
it has a very nice feel to it
which is the hdmi cable
remover onwards to the tablet
so these are the contents
i'm just kidding
hey jojo reference here
let's move on to the driver
i like that
they provided an extra pen
it was very matte
i suppose it was
it's really smooth
would i recommend this tablet
big vk1200 display tablet
I recommend doing it that way
I'll go ahead and unplug this
a silicon casing is
I love this casing
you just take the casing off
if there's button
how well do they respond
you hear that
plastic stand now
that's it really
it's some it's plastic
whoa look at that
displays have that phasing
I know I do
it is good and clear
you get your general games
it has eight gigs left with
I'm sorry 7 gigs
exactly what that means
Bluetooth capable once again
this does in fact
I have those contextual
they're automatically repair
so it's a one thing
I have had value in kid
adjustment this actually
and boy can they get loud
I'm really surprised
how much functions
this is actually a nice
yes yes oh
maybe your 40 quid 50 quid
it's it's not all right
this is the sim bans
I start the review
so let's take a look inside
there is a manual
we have a warranty card
it's imitation leather
is this elastic holder
we have this little clip
I think that's a good price
we have a camera on the back
we have the logo on the back
this tablet is a bit thick
the volume buttons are here
this is the type
C connection pot
this is a micro
it's not very good
it feels too echoey
the resolution is 1280 by 800
the storage is 32
all the way as we have any
diagonal lines that
I put down the department
I'm drawing it now
the diagonal line
it's quite responsive so when
I'm drawing at normal speed
I do not have a lot of jitter
I usually draw
you see all these dots here
I'm using art flow
I really like this app
let's try and sheet this
let's create some dots here
Jeeter but it's very minimal
to find a jitter
let me show you a sketch that
they are quite smooth
they are pretty smooth
you're as well
this is quite smooth
the handwriting is
well I was writing this
this is normal drawing speed
I think it looks fine
I recommend app
flew the battery
it's quite good now
it's quite responsive
we have the case
we have the tablet
the battery life is great
reproduction is quite good
P resolution screen
I think this would be perfect
that's the only thing
I have to stress
Android tablet for drawing
I hope this video is helpful

it's also important
we have dual band

okay okay
that's it for today
at all
it was heavy it was bulky
Amazon's operating system
Smash Hits Super
seven well to be honest
I would highly recommend this
1 5 6 0
one is a power button
it's pretty simple
on the back of the tablet
there are four screw holes
you will be given four screws
then you use the provided
it saved me all the time
it was great
it's pretty simple
About tab you can
I hope you all enjoyed that
I was disappointed
the first box was another box
I had immediately mistaken it

each a pro of the pen is that
i have with the cintiq 16.
which is roughly around 120

Android app on the tablet
you can also load them normal

what do you say keyboard
what do you say swipe
so let's try
the what do you say
it's so smooth
now some of the things that
I have with this tablet
that's thousand ATP
so no shoes with that also
Samsung actually loads up
so you can open up
what do you say office files
so that's a great value
Wi-Fi sound etc
I'd really like about this
that's it for now this is
Randy from tech tabasco
and one
nice feature of this
here you can see
the dragon touch max
10 is well worth a look now

I liked the power adapter
I did use
mirroring work wery well
IPS panel as the original
I have brightness
settings are good
I'm something this size
1080p is adequate on
I think this is a 10 point
it's an even game
I played on
this was halo
Spartan assault which
I'm trying to load here
it's just it
it needs the active venting
it adds exception little bulk
it illuminates aluminum
this is the type
I add original touch cover
I'm pretty awful

it's ten bucks more
it's it's probably word
run time about ten hours
I'm Wi-Fi connectivity

it washes out a little bit
it's a $38 tablet
it plays back perfect
you can do all these things
there's a black
there's a blue
USB to micro USB charge cable
it only has half a gig of ram
so you've got that
but they don't supply one
they give you a user manual
the horizontals are great
so let me go home here
I'll get out of that Temple

and it lags a lot
the biggest problem
I had with this is the case
I easily got through two days
this is a tablet for you
quality isn't bad

I know the thin metal
what's good about the
I finally have to tap it
it doesn't have the full
this is running over
on the way there
you can see the available
update screen finally loaded
you can take a look
what's available for free
not a huge number again
this is pretty much all stock
which is surprising
this is a pretty fast
ok we turn
there is no dedicated
so here's our website
there is no pinch zooming
you have to be careful
that is the web browser next
we'll take a look at what
no stereo speakers
this is pretty good next
the apps let the music player
Photo Viewer sound recorder
these are pre-loaded pictures

it's very reasonable at $199
the device isn't that fast

like an eight inch tablet
von panda out
hi folks so today
we're looking at this
and yeah
this was a quite a lot of fun
I love these
I wasn't quite sure
what the masked tablets were
looks good
and yeah
we've got everything we want
it's got a fixed and built in
the resolution is 1080p
which is something
it's a small tablet though
this is a 16 inch tablet
this is absolutely fine now
the pen is actually nice
it's very stylish
it's got a good grip to it
here's the thing that
here you have
now that's all one cable
there's also a mini
you know no
RGB no VGA cables
it's just one cable
it did get it calibrated
the parallax isn't too bad
I was happy with this
it was giving me smooth lines
this is full color one
you're watching it here
it's a piece
now you can see the screen
there looks slightly greenish
it didn't bother me too much
I'd love to hear
is this something you go for
let's say a surface book
that's kind of cool
it just means that
I just confined it
you'll notice there that
look a bit creepier
they were absolutely great
they had good trouble
the rotating ring was clean
I prefer something bigger
that's just me
you see now that
this is where
it really felt
I can do it faster
the tablet is pretty decent
it's looking pretty cool
I'm happy with this
I've done
I'm pretty happy with this
I mean that's pre swish
do you like it
is this something you'd buy
have you already got one
have a very good day
we have these drawing tablets
Pablo versus Wacom
this is shoe yarn
I've got here in the studio
welcome to panels and borders
is it still
it's not worth it
forgive me on this one anyway
i was contacted to do one
so here we go
i'd have to comment that
tablets are easy to work with
if you have something
i'm pretty sure
your tablet can work now
how accurate does the pen go
you know user friendly also
this is my new tablet now
i am very excited to say that
today's sponsor is xp pen
bamboo tablet since grade 11

it's so cute
so this is the stand
i'm using photoshop
but it's totally seamless
there's no worries about that
is that this pen
i found that it was
i decided to try and quickly
yeah i'm really happy with it
which of course is different
and yeah basically
i find that my ipad
hey there in this video
alright welcome everyone
I believe so yeah
I've made it so anyway
it's it's a big box
I didn't notice right off
okay so boring stuff first
I have not looked at this
it didn't work so anyway
start off with plugs
this is the plug that
I think to HDMI
I've never really used
but if you want to
so this is the tablet
it's got this cover on it
so let's get this off
sorry so in the box there are
I'll put a picture somewhere
this is a first world problem
that seemed to work
okay and that's really all
I should be pressed
okay so it's full
some pictures of this too is
I'm a little shocked
honestly it's you know
I said 400 earlier
this is actually three $59.99
I just to be very clear
they didn't give me any
you know
I'm not really seeing them
it's an expensive
this within this is srgb
there's just the eyeball test
it's not a big difference
the angle is different
I'm just not used to
I'm not used to working with
now this is not a 4k display
okay this is a 1080p monitor
it feels a lot like the
I think it's a
print photo editing
this is not a sponsored video
Home and Student 2013
we're looking at here
there's an SD card
it's a pretty snappy
performance is pretty solid

keys of the tablet
i decided to draw millie
tuber and artist
oh yes okay
and it's affordable
you guys see ya you
it's coming right up
and let's talk about the
it was like seeing
you pick it up and paint
this one is super natural
you get results
right there on the tablet
it never gets old
that gets an eighth
pat the wacom hums so nicely
it's super smooth
it was 300 49.99
that's what it retails at so
I got it

thank you much for watching
hey guys it's the arts here
so let's get started first
i got this very cool box
and here's the pen
we will have the pen holder
okay how about the adapters
they there are two in case
and wow this
it works just practice now
it's super good
all you've got is the screen
I've taken this in the shower
it does work
we do have a micro
SD card slot
they're both sealed here
let's talk about this screen
Samsung's Galaxy Note pro
it's actually very aggressive
I'm firing up
Need for Speed Most
Wanted right here
there's no way
google play music through the
same goes for movies
we're able to swipe through
keep your eye on this guy
what is going on guys
Greg Iles TV
touch max 10 tablet
sure on that on the charger
is it gonna be good
let's load up a game here
we'll load up asphalt 9 here
I've used it
I haven't had too much
I'm in here
you can see 32 gigs of space
they're very bad
this is a 5g tablet so
which is the best processor
this is just horrendous
it's not amazing and
which if you set up
there's no fingerprint either
double press the power button
it'll launch the camera
I'll sort of prevent ringing
let me open up
it'll look fine
RAM amount on here
King on here
yeah cuz you will not be home
I mean if you can run
thanks for watching
see you guys down the road
TV bring it to you a review
I'll provide a short summary
come in two
O's for Bluetooth pen tablet
button right there
so the connectivity was great
I lost some an act
here it's fully connected
it's on right now
I use it on Phil right now
is you can draw various
it's really accurate
this is completely wireless
I do have a ton
I'm destroying general shape
let's say rush
I got a bunch of replacement
it's this gloss edge right
I'm the type of person
i believe it's 18 hours
you can just double check
I got anywhere
between eight to ten hours
just be careful with it
but there you have it guys
that's my review of the way
hey jb here excited
you're with me today
i've never had one
this is a place for reviews
let's open it up first now
it drives me nuts
i did purchase this device
it's just this
setup can be really tricky
you just jump in and use it
i'm not sure
and then we have a books
the case is like hopefully
it's not a sticky case
that's not bad and i
and let's see here
7.8 inches okay
and that's just a bummer
i would pay extra for that
okay so here
it's a little dark
it's powered off right now
we have a power cable
and that's interesting okay
so there's a charger cable
i think it's usbc
i do not like book styluses
they're accessories
it's just so cheap
this thing's plastic
it just doesn't feel good
um and then yeah so
we're going to do two things
see how dark it is
we are back the device is on
we are ready to go
i do not like it
i think it's cheap
it feels like plastic
this is heavy
it's a little bit brighter
that is the maximum
it's not horrible
you can kind of see that okay
let's go a different color
let's go like um gray
i think they're close
i just don't see that's gray
i mean i can make it thicker
the ghosting is a problem
i the colors
just don't do anything for me
okay so writing
that was the first experience
i don't like the stylus
let's see if we can play it
it's i mean almost watchable
that's an a2
i mean obviously
it's it's just ghosting and i
i'm just not sure
oh it's on a2
let me go back to normal
i'm sorry maybe that'll help
it's okay like it's okay
okay so let's go back
um when it
i mean it's it's it's decent
um but they're getting there
i think coleto like three
this is coleto
i think
it's close the writing
experience is not horrible
um it's just not great
i don't think i'd use it
will i use this thing
looks like it's going on ebay
that's my rating of it
you're doing something wrong
Lenovo is more professional
right here feels nice
Lenovo tablets
which means that
this pen is not a capacitive
Android Honeycomb tablets
don't have any buttons
some aren't go figure
there's a SIM card slot
there's actually a carrier
there's a sliding door here
you know
this guy is more stable
you can see we've got
McAfee security loaded here
Lenovo is trying to sell this
that kind of stuff is here
isn't that respect so here
it's a trickle charge
it's very slow
supports both
it's a little bit quirky
but that's okay
it's probably a bit more
one thing about the
that plays great
of course this is over
a little tired holding
it's fully tablet
HD or wear
here's your file
so say you want to edit
there's the USB port
really excellent keyboard
you've attached a laptop dock
now you can see
it's a pretty large phone
it's a 4.3
we'll switch to full screen
that's not bad
we have a 1080p high profile
I've already done here before
jetstream have a two button
you can erase there
I'm pricing for that though
I even announced that again
this is hack the planet today
should you get it or not
the volume buttons are here
there you go
maybe this is for you
it does have a full-size
HDMI that's a good
that's a plus
I'm sure you've seen that
this does support
it's the plastic screen
that has the basic
the lights are dim
the buttons are square
let's take a look at those
you know a mobile
please like share subscribe
so let's get this one unboxed
oh my god it's so big
ah i am so not doing that
right jesus christ
i might use it
aha this time
let's see what we have here
it's gonna be very satisfying
yeah okay
help me and a bunch of screws
we go the canvas
but it feels huge to me
that's cool and it's windows
which is great
it feels very secure
i haven't understanding
major delays in the strokes
let's get some drawing done
i tried walking with it okay
go over the screen
that's what i did
see you on the next video
stay spooky
my pretty darlings bye bye
that was sent over to me from
aspera will append
that's inside this zip back
feels really nice
this is a matte surface
the pen tip now
and this is the pen
this is not a wireless tablet
it's really thin on the back
the big 40 is very solid
Windows driver version
one point six point one
here so here
I have tested Photoshop
are they all work really
they taper really nicely
hot and tablet
this is my two-year-old girl
Tiffany sleeping on her it
this is photoshop on
it's also not as smooth
they are very responsive so
there's no need to buy this
Pablo tablet so
Pablo is 610
I hope this video is helpful
see you in the next video I
once you do that
not every tablet
i recommend this model
you can damage the components
make sure
it's really frustrating
best kaijud lion
rodriguez eleria louis nora
dr casket your boy sd jj jade
and of course lib libli
hello every Dolby
I'll be reviewing a spy
10 model number is Z 3 0 1
he also takes a micro
SD memory card
he can take at the top
the speak is out the front
he has a dual speakers
that's where the speakers are
I'm operating this okay
so for example
let me say go to that
everything is touch sensitive
he has a break
he also has a boo in
Zen motion
I'm sayings Asus
model numbers p 0 to 8
and a case
let's get right into it
we got the tablet itself
we've got the pen
a tablet is kind of a pain
it's a little bit lightweight
kind of feels a little flimsy
it has a screen protector
i didn't like it but this one
wires would have to go down
i mean you can deal with it
model the artist pro 13.3
i had to fiddle with it a lot
the drivers are all familiar
it has a very soft grip
that's very pleasant to hold
so is this a good buy
that does it for this review
hopefully that'll change soon
i'm bad at ending videos
hello everyone so today
I'm reviewing for this
it's bigger screen
and this is the
Motorola design board
8.2 it's available now on
it's unique it's interesting
there's your speaker hole
here's your micro
I'm bored 10.1
nothing at all
now what does iboard 10.1
I unscrewed them
on the 10.1
Goldilocks right sometimes
well there's the 8.2 for you
let's see right here
the words are fairly small
Nexus runs on that CPU
not quite as fast as a 10.1
perhaps they're not pushing
that's not a bad capacity
says a gig of ram
I'm using Android explorer
well correct if
the zoom was never cheap
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
10.1 has longer battery life
this design board
here's the pen from the 10.1
and you can see
we'll take a look at that
use that moto cast
really fun game
that's golf 2
it's funny that sketches
we've got the usual
Verizon data counter widget
how much data you use
we've got it
we've also got
you're plenty of options
that's included called digit
and those of you who used
you see right here
video review
let's see how to
LT reception this is decent
we find those eye board
certainly can help with that
not just because it's bigger
not super look at you
seems to work
oh yeah yeah again
yeah it's open
my right is redo while
[ __ ]
see easy peasy
beggars can't be choosers
hello everyone in this video
i'll be reviewing this gmac
m70 kids android tablet now
this tablet is affordable
so it's pretty useful
now bear in mind
this is a budget price tablet
it does have a front camera
doesn't have no flash
um to the settings
it shouldn't be that bad now
but not much else
this next one is the first
Wacom tablet that
I'm going to be showing
that's not used now though
that doesn't have one
I quite like the accent
color of that seafoam green
there's a power button on it
I also like that
it's kind of a small detail
it just works perfectly
it is a 13-inch
I noticed with this Cintiq
thank you so much to them
it costs about $1,500
this tablet works really well
it's still very responsive
it's the CV 720 ug tablet
I can answer
hello girls and guys
8-inch dual core tablet that
it's dual core number two
have you know they felt like
and and that's great it it is
it's a great budget tablet
even you know
Windows tablets
this is not what that is this
is you know a budget tablet
working on this tablet
I get started
I can't really show you that
the battery gets hot
I can't promise it'll do it
this is the second one
bring up the keyboard
I they are
they had no
I don't know who to believe
I have no idea

I hope to see you next time

hi i'm vicki
kids edition tablet
big kid tablet now
i had both tablets set up
you can see
so what's actually on there
books all kinds of things
so i really love that
you've got harry potter there
you've got cbb's characters
so it's an eight inch screen
it's not just robust
gigs is good
um it fills up quite fast
there is space for an sd card
put the sim card
put the sd card in
not doing anything else
they can only have it
how many hours or minutes
what time they end
they are fantastic
they are built to last
hey guys your own apology
taro shimla here
I found it for around 80
it was on sale
Windows tablet with keyboard
yeah one or 10.1
not the best camera
I'm gonna flip this guy over
it is a really nice
you know
I don't get to go with it
you know for $80
let's see what else we've got
I'm assuming this is yep
like right here
you know
nice quiet keys
yeah although
at first glance
the screen is nice and bright
please don't forget to
Jotaro Chima peace out
USB cable along with this
you can see the unlock button
i played these games along
they work quite well
Android device
Hodel this is the Acer Iconia
which is this one
I'm quite enjoying it
the speaker is about here
so that's one the first thing
I did was stick
a new launcher on
it doesn't matter easy snap
I don't use easy
it's just your standard
I do quite like that
all the games
so that's pretty much it
I'd fairly happy with it
hi everyone
it's got these
it's got a micro
it does
it looks good
it runs nice and smooth
and this is
I got to turn on right now
it'd be like really quiet
you can schedule power
you got the face
unlock a voice unlock
you got the text-to-speech
I went ahead
all right
so here's the quadrant
he usually screens that
Android tablets pretty much
I mean everything
just check the
tap the Frog HD
which one did I load on here
that racing game
let's see here
it's very smooth very clear
I have about the tablet is
that play
Buy it was on special
so if you go to your local
I don't use
it is model
in this
if you are a die-hard gamer
basic photo needs
but once again
it has a 17.5
watt hour battery
I can get with moderate use
it's fairly basic
see what this is
IPS screen which is very nice
it's got a nice fluid motion
Birds Netflix YouTube
it is running android 5.1
this is 4121 millivolts
I said it's amazing to me
how long the battery lasts
I get I kid you not
there you go you can see
you're gonna pay for it
alright so now that
you have your volume rocker
basically up and down
I believe that's a microphone
it's sad the one
I have in here
it's just a 16 gigabyte
so don't say
the five percent off discount
stand up so
how did it arrive to me
and how easy was it to set up
you absolutely can do that
which is great
held me back drastically
the other thing
quite a bit so
the device is eight hundred
you get out of the device
my answer is absolutely
it's a tricky line to walk
I didn't find the device
help me back from what
this is definitely great
bang for your buck anyways
that is it for this video
I'll see you later
thanks for watching
that's it for now
I'll see you later
okay so about two weeks ago
I could find on Amazon
oh that's my daughter
yeah so of course you know
I do like that
I didn't have to pay anything
these are the game
are there demos
I'm not sure so
yeah she'd probably like this
anyway for 40 bucks
I think it works pretty good
those are the specs on it
I'm pretty cool
yeah that's about it
this might be one of them
we find a user manual
you get a plug-in charger
i just want to tell you
i've already had it boot up
that's exactly what this did
i happen to like this one
it's called tune blast
isn't that bad at all
i said it runs android
uh then you know
that stands out it works well
it feels nice in the hand
it supports 720p
inch tablet now
quality is okay for a tablet
it does an adequate job
it feels sturdy
thanks for watching
we'll see you next time bye
hey everyone Leo bond here
I'm back again today
it's soft flexible
you have three main sections
so for that one

I do recommend this thing
take that frog
what's up guys
we go so
this is nice
so we're good
let's check it out alright so
I'm here at my desk right now
I Photoshop started up here

Yui on thank you for choosing
okay so in this box
let's not look perfect
oh bloody idiots
I don't need to wipe anything

step one do this
I think I'm done
that was two steps
I'm done so
do you guys run out of nibs
I've got a gift
oh it even says gift
that's it cuz
this is a gift
is this another pin
once it's all plugged in
click on the Downloads
and you're good to go
so that's really cool
click and the middle
it turns out
I cracked open my custom
it really felt like
I don't know I just do
that surprised me
I made a bit of a workaround
that doesn't need to be there
I found it
I created the painting
I felt in no way inhibited

Milo! See these guns, milo?
retrorocket disk hey
it is multimode
this is the four gig model
it's got four gig
RAM 500 gig hard drive
do not buy one
that has four gigs
I hate to say it
touchscreen is really
it's really just a gimmick so
you take the four gigs
you take the more
RAM and the more storage
it's a very attractive laptop
I'm showing right now
there's also ten mode
a hinge around the hinge
the hinge rotates fully
the screen is facing up
let me login a second
let me just show you this
I'm going to login
we go now
that's pretty cool
alright so how was
I think it feels really good
it it does feel solid
the deck is actually aluminum
somebody's been embezzling
I'm I'm just overdoing it
wise it's okay
let's see if I can sue it
that's this shallow
it's really quite nice
it feels cheap
that's on this
but this one does not
I I like totally removed
I'm going to tell you
but for most indie games
it's fine casual browsing
it's quite good
it works really well
it stays quite cool even when
here's the power button
here's the bad part
let's see USB ports
there's two on this side
not bad at all really
it's not a mini
one it's an so will HDMI port
that's really nice
how are you really cool
this is the power cable
it's this square thing
there's no wrong way to do it
this is really nice
hey what's the verdict
Wi-Fi connectivity
mAh battery to back it up
mm headset jack
that are already available
this isn't a storage
keep watching thank you
let's take a look at the
nothing too special
it probably also helps out
they're both running KitKat
lack a lot of detail
so it's nice to see
but not only
is it running KitKat
which was very nice to see
get what you pay for anyways
Lenovo logo and on the center
there is front-facing camera
port is really good
Lenovo logo is discretely
power and volume buttons
the tablet have full windows
we try a dope
not for taking pictures
first let's say Microsoft
you did a great job
all right so today
let's see what we've got here
is they're just nice
if we pop open the base
it's super long
this thing is small
which means that when
I'm gonna clients locations
let's go to the computer
let's click on stop
just choose next
let's choose next now
okay now it's connected
how do you charge the battery
Express keys the touch here
with that
it's mapped to the tablet
I only have to go here so now
it's all reset again
Express keys a touch ring
how much pressure
I'm putting on the tablet now
I tilt that pin
I get a darker amount of that
I'm working on images
I'm gonna choose my tablet
I like to work
is this little padlock
so why
a little bit okay
all right so
there's no lag
it's good pressure
I've ever used does that
that's one of the things
I really love it
so it's 250 bucks for this so
Wacom or Wacom
I'll see you at the cafe
this is an 8 inch
in this video
you get one micro
you have single banner
and here it shows
the box is not rooted
we just saw that
the box is not rooted
thanks for watching
what's up everybody
okay so first off
supplies 5 volts to 2 amps
so here is the tablet itself
stock very simple smooth
so we've pretty much
i think we have like 22 gigs
here's our battery
i haven't charged it
86 percent here's the display
no problems there
it looks great
i don't see any lag
it's pretty smooth
the graphics are okay
it's pretty smooth
we are in the settings
don't see any lag
but it's good enough
you're going to watch
it's not horrible again
this tablet is very capable
it can handle some games
is its battery life
i recharged the tablet
nice and loud
it's got that metal back
so you guys so
thank you guys for watching
that's unbelievable pricing
that feels nice
inch lenovo tablet now
i think it feels great
the front is all glass
i mean it feels great to hold
it's nice and thin overall
it's a 10.1
they're nice and clicky
there is a trackpad again
like i said so
it is made out of plastic
so it's a little more flimsy
that can do that for you
i think 16 by 10 is perfect
it gets 400
nits of brightness
the other nice thing
that lenovo did that
i would put it
it's nice to have the keys
are a little bit cramped
uh the one thing about it
it doesn't have the software
so just be forewarned in that
it handles it all very well
play store now
they claim 10 hours again
right now so again
Dow tee pad 10.1
so it's a dual
SIM tablet
that is nothing the bottom
here you can see

I like it even though
it's not a fast
charger is normal type
it unlocking is quite fast
let's try to open some page
ya can see
what is online
it's quite normal
you can read
the k77 has a half gig of ram

I don't know how it felt good
it felt sturdy
I was worried about
coming off
that's my camera
you also get a 2 button pen
I ran into now
this fix was really easy
it worked exactly as intended
you know
I have is with the pen
it's just a feeling that
I can't help but notice

Welcome back to the channel.
Pro. It's shocking.
You can see
Just a little secret.
It's not gorgeous.
It's very practical.
You get the charge cable.
You do get an adapter.
So that is key.
You can see the screen size.
One, two, three. Silk.
Silk should not be faster.
There we go.
All right, here we go.
That is frightening.
There we go.
Let's try, one, two, three.
One, two, three.
Pro is a little bit
I'm really impressed by this.
Let's do a really good photo.
Let's do video.
Gonna switch to video.
It's not that intuitive.
There you go this way.
(camera clicks)
And now for the drop test.
(tablet thumps)
So far, so good.
No markings on the case.
One, two, three.
(tablet smacks)
That's gotta hurt.
(tablet bangs) (tablet slams)
That was hard.
One, two, three.
(tablet bangs)
This was a quick break.

i'm still not perfect at it
look to the skin
i downloaded them
us dollars on amazon
i created with it
this is a pretty old tablet
so his review
it's not softly anyway
but we ain't gonna do that
we are going to switch it on
which is oh
we're done eat green early
I lied right
we like that mini HDMI port
we like that as well
this is a very well specs
our tablet for its age
you don't tend to find many
that are capacitive buttons
let's show you something
i'm chinese tablets
tends to be a bit weird
nope just speed dial
let's go on
yes yes as you can see this
just a reference i think
so that's that now let's try
Angry Birds Angry Birds

sound all of sound but look
it's fine
isn't it only white right
various things on here
YouTube works great for work
settings work several
i believe about 80 pounds
its ears is quite heavy
the belt is absolutely lovely
it's barely worth twenty
because that's what they do
though it's addressed to me
that's awesome
you don't click these
Keys by mistake definitely
I always when I hold my pen
is this tip of the pen
they are all the same kind
it's actually very small
this is definitely packaged
I have I have heft
this is my fifth fifth temple
I'm not being paid to do this
I am very impressed
you mean you know you know
I like it
I mean you could switch it
you want the right size
that's my pcs over
so yeah just a heads up
also the size of the tablet
the amount of time that
I've been playing with this
so it's not really a problem
it's nothing
it is really good
I guess but twenty dollars
it's like it's it's good
it is very responsive

you need a tablet driver
like me
okay that's it
touch a company to be honest
this asked me
we have the box
i'm pretty confident
there's a warranty card
you've got a 3.5 millimeter
power button and reset here
right of the k10
it's called to the touch
so that's a pleasant surprise
here's the reason
protector loves fingerprints
it doesn't feel too heavy
it's a budget tablet
it's got 10.1
b g n and ac no wi-fi 6 here
but what did you expect
that's certainly a good thing
aka android pie
no bloatware whatsoever
so that's a good thing
doesn't slow down the tablet
netflix isn't too bad
you can see
i'm using both youtube
it's working perfectly
it does a pretty good job
shark without many hiccups
this tablet aren't great
low light shots are bad
i feel
look it costs 100 quid
let's not be around the bush
you get a max db of 19.8
it sounds very tinny
it's completely flat
do i recommend this tablet
why even watching this video
it's fast enough
the speakers aren't great
the display isn't amazing
everything you need it to do
thanks for watching
i don't wanna fight
holy said that a car
look at that
aluminum is not plastic
you say it has
max customer service

ever to use a trackball mouse
that's another thing anyway
i still have it
i've a lump on my wrist here
which is my
which is fantastic
you don't need to charge
i use none of that
and um yeah i just
you want to be accurate
that's why i think
i use the trap
i didn't like it at all
how i edit my photos
so who do
it's as intense as an artist

one has a resistive screen
where this one has
it has a capacitive screen
the quality is not very good
it's a point three megapixel
we got different widgets
core processors go
it is a pretty good processor
that works well
so games like fruit
ninja work too
it's one of his strengths
because the amazon app store
they have a lot of apps
I did here with Google Maps
well one thing with the mini
so that's kind of annoying
look at the battery
I've been doing this review
I in my opinion
it's not a bad budget tablet
so thank you for watching
it's the deco mini seven
i like the packaging
which is that's quite a lot
okay oh once again
it's quite useful
i like that i think
this pen is really nice

i'd use the larger tablets
in terms of cost
and i do yeah
i really do
love this tablet
so yes thank you bye
earlier this month
I pulled up paint tool
I genuinely appreciate
the pen itself feels light
it's just a hassle
I really don't like that
Bakke is really good
this is the 10.1 inch version

you also get three months of
CPU on the front here
we also get our user manual
non pro versions for the cpu
we have the power
VR rogue GE

OpenGL and Vulcan

Disney Plus now keep in mind
Disney Plus loads right up
just to give you a look
I'm set to 8 chunks

PSP emulation using ppsspp

it's pretty bad no
2019 has more power than this
but it's running
Plus and Netflix ready to go
but that's it for this one
thanks for watching
tab fills excellent enhance
so today
i'll show you how that works
let's start with an unboxing
the stylus is battery free
and you'll find this stylus
that you should remove first
when it's attached
i usually do that
a color picker brush eraser
how the shortcuts
react to me using the dial
this was one of the tests
i've had and that's free now
it might be a bit different
that this video is in
i especially love that
i like big screens
i'm publishing this video
i'm really happy about it
i hope you enjoyed it
Oh welcome to
kids will do this
and they'll do this
is that just quickly
Tony a great job
love this that you know
you can go to the normal
we're going to call up
let's do the chore list
but what you can do
take a shower here
you know
they do enough chores
I will unlock that
so that's a neat aspect of it
so that's a cool idea
do things like unlock
SC you can just unlock it
is that right out of the box
I can have this set
where after a p.m.
no more knobby
I use the tablet can I use it
it'll just be locked out
unlock it and earn extra time
I think that's great
lots of that
A standard tablet then
i do
i have this xp pen
it didn't work
the startup guide extra nibs
i think it looks good
it just feels kind of weird
it looks pretty good
and uh yeah i
i don't really need that
uh what i needed to do
it was very easy
you can also set
i'm not used to that
anything else about this
i really like that
you can do that or just
use it as a mouse personally
how do you write
and she was like
it's not expensive at all
i even tried to use it on osu
i tried it on photoshop
i tried it on
three great diversity
i guess bye
this guy also has two cameras
now all that aside
now oddly enough
so we have the lock button
a good thing about that is
i left this on my desk
we got the elderly
this is a great tablet
this has a ton of things
but it's definitely doable

Air made me envy
like Nova or Niagara.
Remember Kaleido
I've used before.
the screen is a hot rod.
I do on my phone
So why not
This is called ghosting
But let's be real, right?
Just keep in mind
To rotate the screen
It all adds up to a device
Don't get me wrong
(upbeat music)
but let's face it
i guess is amazon
it's a 7 inch tablet
that only costs 50 dollars
come in this
it's a quad-core 1.3
it is beyond slow apps
take forever to open up
i even find myself
so what can you expect
that is a plus
they cut back to save money
yes it's really bad
it's a 7 inch
it's just not very bright
it gets loud enough
well it has a camera
don't use the cameras
the cameras are also horrible
you've probably used before
most of the popular
the issue is uh storage
it's only fifty dollars
not only is it durable
i mean it's perfect for that
it's so cheap
so is it worth it
well once again
I offer to you take last
my name is Sian
you make up your mind

another thing that
there's no sort of lag
I absolutely love the design
they're extremely responsive
I feel that it's a good width
you can hold it comfortably
and you simply plug in
you've got a bigger screen
everything is secure
I think is a complete bargain
it works extremely well
is this kind of thing
gets more and more popular
I don't really like that
make sure to check out

you've got a a micro
it is a fast charger
it's a pump
this water mattered
it's perfect
I'm very impressed with that
you know cheap budget tablets
absolutely they may
what else have we got
and of course then
so when you need to charge it
put the charger in
being a large 10 inch tablet
well it's it's perfect
so yeah there you are
hey there everyone
those of you
I've been using the same
I have been
everything was super secure
let's dive right into it
starting with the pros
I was worried about you
I have to worry about
is that taking
I'm not going to forget this
Wacom I worked with before
Wacom tablets
what can I say
hey cafe crew
Colin Smith here and today
this was my very first
Wacom tablet just to show you
how far is coming
so let's start with
it's really quite slick
Wacom pen too and yes
there's no lag or anything
one of these is touch
we want the touch ring to do
I want to put
I can just pull the red off
that's one of the big changes
we could do the back button
of course we can hit that
it's a hard to put in full
so what else we got here
well we've got the touch
they will do different things
and you can see you know
okay so here we are in our
Express keys so
why don't we under photoshop
let's choose the application
I really want to do
I like it
I like the way it works
I like the way it feels
so there's the before image
I recommend it put that about
it's great you can draw
it's essential so really
it feels really nice
I like the fact
I hope you enjoyed it
Wacom tablet right now
are you impressed by this
I'll see you at the cafe
I would like to mention that
I could get
this was entirely me
any negatively affects people
so that's all
this was exactly the case
the redesigned the tablets
NS and it honestly
is your blue cleaning
I believe it's 2008
it's what
I'm more traveling
there's also a red
you're also provided words
it's ready to go drive
this like the unique tabla
it's very thin
the pen is battery free
I don't have too many
I already finished the image
it's absolutely great
this was brilliant
this tablet retails for 199
it's no longer valid
12 that's all
I actually do that
a lot with soccer matches
but that's a whole nother
that's plenty for a day
it actually supports microSD
so you can pop
you might want to put on here
this is running android
so that's worth knowing
7s not having an audio jack
Bluetooth 4.1 so
this is a 10 inch tablet
I don't know $5.99 $7.99
that's crazy and expensive
which is a micro
and it's very nippy
okay let's go up register
I'm not really complaining
at least battery
I've tested this out
I hope you enjoyed the video
thanks for watching

you can choose
I have reassign it
this light will light up
let's has the strokes
it does work quite well
it seems that drawing at 100%
I get a slight jito now
this is now much smoother
I like to use zoom in
so it's not really a problem
I seldom draw at 100% zoom
this is 200% zoom and
I'm using right now
so the strokes
they appear perfectly fine
it's quite smooth as well
this is coyote sketches
Pro pressure looks here
they work pretty well

I mean I will draw for you
it's very short
so how does
Windows 10 look on tablets
Start screen all around now
there is your task view
is that at the bottom
I had that were pin there
that kind of disappeared

let me know otherwise
with a 10 inch display
so here is the tablet itself
yeah for a entry level tablet
okay right here we have

I don't know what it called
free protect protector
I'm seeing some bubbles
the viewing angles are great
it's very clear
this tablet is pretty loud
they are and in fact
I feel especially the louder
distortion is a problem
I noticed that sometimes
it's reasonably good
okay so right now
it's not that bad
the output is reasonably good
the leap pattern has a double
I believe
that's a single
LeapPad 10 doesn't disappoint
I would recommend this
I would say so

point exactly dialed in there
not all that heavy
I like the size
it's going to be here
your power button is here
you might see that
that one costs a little bit
that's a pretty good deal
this will do just fine
RAM might make a difference
so here you go
might bring you here

how good is the response
m6 dual sim quad core
10.1 inch tablet
doing china
nothing else much on the box
you get a case
there actually really nice
you get the screen protector
there the tablet itself
that's pretty normal
nothing else on the top
just put that to one side
i move the box out though
g got some apps there
youtube youtube kids

let's say storage
i have downloaded a few apps
which is really good system

price for a display
tablet is definitely good
the pen is great
and that's my review
I needed a new tablet
like bad man my old
oh my god
whoa in return
now mind you
but even that's pretty easy
I'm not a huge fan
it's pretty damn nice to use
tablet user like me
I'd like to say so
who wants to get into tablets
I think that makes sense okay
this is not a tutorial
insert it in the end
this is a pretty cool feature
this is pretty cool alright
it pulls up that folder
a notebook and quick sheets
and let me just show you how
I use this
and what makes it so spiffy
and here's last week
I have one folder
I do the same thing
wait a minute did
I forget to do something
oh yeah
communication to do's that
so let's say
I can take this file
I hit Send
it's gone so
i hit send by email
and there's an erase feature
stop the shipment
but it's in the wrong place
it's in just a
it's like a sticky note
almost all right now
here's what's really cool is
it's really cool
I come down here

hi folks
along with the $49
it's a 8 inch tablet
it's got a really nice rigid
feel to it feels very solid
there's a micro
feel to a lot thinner
a lot lighter
I'm impressed with the screen
it does have really nice
it kind of minds me of
Samsung's tablets
is this new fire
OS 5 operating system
I do like it a lot
have this bar up here
you tap here
book early is the new default
what's that button
she's got good sound
I don't know who has this map
which is kind of interesting
so this comic
it looks fantastic
just not quite as nice
not having any responsiveness
here's a sample of
YouTube video plays so yeah
YouTube videos work
ebooks deals so
right hi guys
and they
it's kind of an older one so
but it's got bluetooth
the previous few
well that's a bit awkward
a little wait
I'm super nice
thank you card
it's very polite
you're welcome what was he
that's protective film thing
then what the ones in the
I get on with
it's a little lock on it
I have no idea
this is the temporary
Everett rusty penholder
these are always handy
it's it's not so
that's quite the pin
it's so quite look
the previous huion tablet
Wacom Intuos pen
yeah it feels quite nice
I didn't use them very much
just hold out though
that's pretty good
it seems like a good idea so
it's er it's nice eh
after a little
I'm using it
it's quite nice
it's quite surprised
actually how its
you can configure that in
Supra have the same thing
the bump means you
I'm really happy with it
I'm really happy that it
I had where it would know
there it was
it was a joy to use so
yes so there is
that's my review
you know really good like
I say I would have
that's great
who are you
yeah this brand is actually
they're not bad at all
a hundred pound
turbo is 110 pounds
I think it was an Amazon
so yeah thanks for listening
always drawing they
IPS display panel
that means the colors on
this tablet are amazing
it also comes with the latest
this is perfect for you
tap quantum 10-inch
which has a poor camera
price is unbelievable
don't even have right now
that's a lot of playtime
this is all that you need
what sets this amazing tablet
PPI in short
it weighs less than a pound
Amazon has well over
everybody loves this tablet
there is a card slot
it are pretty good actually
the display quality is okay
cheap and detachable
do travel time here
click on this side
this doesn't you know
there won't delete anything
so here we go
pretty nicely actually
no dropped frames here
a very smooth playback
but you get the idea
that's hot out
I was pleased to see
is that the warranty on
I have looked at recently
so that is a good thing
it's about 2.8
let's let's unbox this
alright let's see it
it's really really light
it's packaged really
I did not expect that
that's pretty cool
you know my $3,000
I'm not sure how it pops out
let's see do customer
these are super useful
it feels nice
it doesn't feel super cheap
nibs unscrew that here see
it's a very light plastic
it feels comfortable
I noticed pen
buttons are are clicky
I'd have to say pretty cool
so let's put that back in
just feel really nice
this thing is super light
we go peel all that off
let's install the thing so
that's almost twelve inches
it's 11 point something
we'll try it out
Wacom pens have so
see how that feels and like
I said earlier
the pen doesn't use a battery
you don't have to charge it
which again is something that
we'll see how they go
it looks really nice
we've got a logo
oh hey look
so it's moving
it's following my cursor
let's test the corners
the screen itself feels nice
looks really nice
the colors are okay
I'm not a huge color expert
so here's the big test
would you look at that
it works right off the bat
what a pain
this thing is awesome
I'm super stoked about that
click double click left
Oh you can also have it
klk are mode switch
I'm not sure what that does
let's find out ok
that's kind of cool
so with the klk
it's like clicky
that's pretty neat
yeah so far
I usually set my second mouse
we'll keep that right
click for now
what does that do
so that's pretty cool now
what's going on with that
let's see so
this is useful
it's windows ink
there's no one answer
the second one is alt
so that's pretty useful
so that's undo cool
is that what that means
no oh
I see so the klk our function
go back a frame
I'm very impressed
I'm very happy with that
it's got everything that the
it feels pretty on the nose
it's not liking at all
this thing's awesome would
I would recommend this
100% the only downside
does this stay on
no okay so yeah
okay check that out the
it's not drawing at all oh
yeah that's pretty cool
so that's awesome
that's really cool
I think that's gonna do it
this tablet's awesome
i 100% recommend it
I have no issues with it
it turned on fine
installation was easy
the drivers are awesome
it's pretty light
I wouldn't really complain
it's not the best feeling
it was super easy to draw on
it's a bit kind of sticky
not too bad
I'll catch you guys next time
take it easy buh-bye
- Thanks for joining me.

Now let's discuss the pen.
Pen pressure on the Mast

this is the new Cintiq 16
so what is this
it is a pen display basically
what's new here well
Wacom is doing here is
well let's take a look at the
it's it's exactly the way
it's all there
I'm using a really wide brush
there's less space
you can tilt the pen this way
I've set it in other videos
this is all to say
there is a stand that
this comes with a combo cable
just not the remote
I'm looking in the Box now
oh look there are extra nibs

nibs and there are more pen
the screen is fully laminated

i got from a previous tablet
i do want to mention that
uh so i keep
i hope i'm saying it right
this is kind of a i
the current tablet
i use does the same thing
where around the edges
and then i toned it down
thankfully i also like how
vk 1200 is 249.99 on amazon
for the tablet
so that makes it so
4.5 out of 5 stars the reason
i'm not giving it a full
he was a lot of fun to draw
so let's check it out
this is the
Intuos it's a thin
Windows or on a Mac
what's the difference

let's put it
I just put this right here
I love the tablet like I said
I think I need to update it
hi this is
I'll also be testing
I'm working on
felt the tablet
did they not include it
what's going on
where it shows you if your
the price is insanely good
I was surprised to look up
US dollars which is crazy
like that's a wonderful price
I tried to find a comparable
my current tablet
but it's just one thing
time's that being said had
you really cannot beat it
hey what does happen
it's nothing special
which inside you'll find
it's actually pretty good
I think it works pretty well
acrobatics the keys
here's what it sounds like
and there you go
and here are these speeds
it could be better
but that's that so
and not only that
it's actually a single band
we don't have five gigahertz
of course it's 2.4 gigahertz
we can say that it is running
at 1600 megahertz
now all
and we are finally online now
I'm not too sure so
just simply forget it
and what do you know the
Wi-Fi has disconnected again
maybe you can get an
in my opinion
that's some very severe back
now does it work
and should you get it
well first
it does look pretty nice
it's pretty big
which is a good thing
it's actually pretty small
it's not a whole lot
we only have 2.4 gigahertz
it's pretty ok
it's not that bad
I haven't talked about yet
it's a local file
it has the old band
This is the Dash
For this display
that tightens down.
cintiq 22 inch hd touch and
i have an xp pen
22 inch second generation
my problem is now
i know that they have some
so first
xp pen is the build quality
so that's the outside
we had the cover plate
we had all the cables
that doesn't happen anymore
this is the stylus holder
so if i were to open this up
you can pull it out
so what you could do
this pen is the pa
i'm not sure which one it is
let's go ahead and see
which is pen tablet right
it's already running
let's maybe draw see
i'm pleased
so you're looking at used
i'll cover the shipping
how's that sound
that's it for me you guys
only much bigger
I found no reason to fault
I did see from time to time
however and when gaming
they do get pretty loud
I did like that
it's standby time
its five days before
Play Store once again
The tablet I paid for.
That’s what I paid for.
That’s what I got.
End of 2019
Wacom sent me a Cintiq
No. Am I doing one anyway?
24 is the perfect size.
What a dumb fool I was.
I have desk space.
I can sit.
I can stand.
And I do.
I always keep touch off.
Nope. Not a problem.
It’s not going anywhere.
It’s just a C clamp.
You need a decent desk.
It does in fact matter.
The 24 Pro doesn’t do that.
I turn it on. It works.
Off and back on.
But you know what?
Oh boy, does it have a fan.
Agh! It’s so loud!
It cycles every few seconds.
Pro is defunct.
Right side, check.
Left side, slippery slope.
That remote didn’t fall.
Is it a driver issue?
Is it Toon Boom?
It could be anything.
But not today. Not yet.
Maybe the driver will update.
I suspect driver issues.
Smooth. Smooooooooth.
I tried one of the pens
that has three buttons.
I thought that would be cool.
The 27QHD is a quiet T-rex.
I think it's a fennec fox
so as you know
it's very simple
one potential issue
quite unusual is very thin
there is a loop on the end
I don't know what that's for
nib felt quite sturdy
I've used the pen
nib kind of felt unsteady
as that makes sense
there's an option for it
that's actually very loud
so for example
however as a point
Windows ink turned on
the setup was simple
it's very cheap
it feels fairly solid
I stole a long way to go
about this tablet
who knows better
start swearing a lot
so they know
my channel isn't for kids
I'm kidding anyway
I hope you enjoyed the video
I'm really sorry
and so they said to hate
I mean sorry
this is output
here's the mechanism
you just pull this thing
it seems to work pretty well
of course the stylus
I think that's what's called
all of that
I don't know so right now
it's it's pretty pretty nice
it's there's very little lag
I also forgot to mention that
I asked you guys on Twitter
it's already a drawing
why would I draw it again
this this is a anti-lgbt
Sid the Science Kid I guess I
so that's what we're gonna do
let's let's keep going
Perl is pretty simple
she's like super thin
I forgot about that
let's line the stomach
well see then
how are we gonna do the legs
no siree well
I'm so proud of myself
we have the fill tool
let's do combination uh
I know they're pastel
like right
do you need
I mean look at this
well this was
just really quick
I loved it so much
I mean not completely
Pablo here on the front
I mean back in 2005
sensitivity is amazing
you get your
I want to turn it over
I take my brush pen
I'm genuinely impressed
trying to figure out you know
what is a tablet
I need back in
I assumed you always needed
I'm really impressed by that
this is your skin skin skin
this is her skin and it
my line art layer
I'm using the Dodge tool
well no
they're not really tattoos
I can't really explain them
I don't like that one
I'm working on the hair
yeah that works and then
I tried troubleshooting it
and for whatever reason
thanks guys bye
hey everyone so today
this thing is tiny
it's great for travel
it's just super simple
this is a really nice tablet
it is quite big
I notice no lag at all
maybe a newer one would work
that has faster
Windows but my Mac
activating it when
I travel a full time in an RV
well for portability again
just nice to have so again
it's really comfortable
that feel really nice
it's totally usable
so you can see it
there's a good feel to it
there's barely a flange on it
it feels smooth as butter
it's just
it's a little bit noisier
that's one thing
I did with the top button
so let me
I'm sure what they do
so that's useful but where
Photoshop is photographers
it's really easy to do
not exactly what I want
so now let's say
I kind of paint that in
let me make that smaller
I mean everywhere
brings up this
I said you can zoom with this
it's a little clunky
so wherever you put your pen
and then under mapping what
two which is what
I'm using Photoshop
they're huge so
I had lot of fun making it
I got in the gallon
Galman website itself
I do like that
initial surface texture
this is a battery for you
it's got four
there's a few other features
I have had with
we can set the fan
nothing's really happening
I hit the right click option
let's try getting a brush
what kind of options so yeah
you know who is this for it
on the go of it so see
they seem to really like it
yeah on a sketch like this
I'll see you next time
who merely wants to use it
but is it any better
it feels tiring
which one looks better okay
inch ips
active pen stylus
active pen is sold separately
cover that is priced at 199
the one edgy
look at that it's beautiful
it's great nice
let's go inside
it's uh that's it next
I got this nice little pouch
nice little fabric
yeah tell us that okay
it's in a neat
I assume look at that
that's a nice looking pen
it's got the buttons on it
it's it's pretty light
probably not as cool
it's easy to install
I like I'm thick
okay the things
would you like to save it
just flat out disappeared
this is kind of painful

the camera quality mediocre
it didn't help you
hello gamers so today
so you know what sure
why not they were kind enough
so this tablet does it draw
well does it run
well honestly
so here's the big question
what about the price
it's sleek looking
it's nice it runs
i mean it is a tablet
that is the end
i'll be seeing you later
this is louder and softer
this is the help screen
is the home screen

i'm pleasantly surprised
and it was great
i really like this
it does what it's meant to do
i like that
Nova spirit Eggman today
well it's called pika going
it could do both solid
let's get started now
this is the screen
here's another feature
keyboards are disabled
total weight of
megapixel which is 640 by 480
you can't hear a thing
I first using this
typing on
this guy was very very easy
I was able to type at normal
it's a weaker cpu

Reddit or stuff like that
Excel or Word

it was very very hard like
it is a weaker
what what can you know the
this thing is great
check this out is the new
I'm not gonna like it
hey don't feel bad little guy
I've personally ever drawn on
the screen is 11.6 inches
it's not a laminated display
that too is customizable
I've used swiping a lot
what's in the box
it's all combined into one
I think that about covers it
it's nothing special
but it's solid
you have to buy it extra
so what's your finger
what you got there
I'm working on that
I just didn't need it
this is a battery free pen
thanks to the flat sided
hexagonal design
let's go to the drawing test
I don't want jitter
I don't want waves
really well around curves so
this 12 inch form factor
I can pull it off my desk
set it on my lap
it's not really a hot spot
let me go back on that
let's clean that up right now

it's it's it's quite weird
I move any further
it is quite scratchy
Android software on this one

it certainly did do the job
well done so a great big
let's get started
I'm sure as time goes on
Android tablets now
the display on here is 1080p

I say it
huion in spray

I'm bit of an elitist
I love my display tablets
I like drawing on the screen
this is the first time where
don't get me wrong
I've used that a lot
I'm trying to make is
it was really comfortable
it makes a huge difference
which is obviously what

Alcatel 310 tablet as always

DisplayPort which is key

there's this row of button
you'll feel the line okay
so you've got eight buttons
I have so far now
okay now using this time
mix-up oh no s 640
you hit a small one
I wrapped it up a paper now
it's the same pen
I really like is the driver
okay for this tablet
okay you just need to
only okay so yeah
okay now if let's say
I grab a color
that won't change none at all
okay like a brush
the bottom left side
it's a hand tool so
okay and then
it's a tablet review so
I need some space
okay okay
so that's it for this
Oh out of so many tablet
how many star
I will say so far
okay it's so small that
I really like that
we'll see you next time

but that's it for this one
it's the end of the video
Hey guys, how's it going!
And they gave me this..
An Artist 12 tablet.
The stand that comes with it.
Oooo, check it out!
Ooo you see my reflection?
Oooh Check it out.
Look at all this stuff.
Wow, look at that.
I'm not sure.
We'll test it out later.
Ooooo, check how shiny it is!
I'm just gonna take it off.
You guys ready?
Oh! I'm using it backwards.
And let me put this on here.
Lots of cables.
I gotcha, okay!
I figured this out, guys.
It looks pretty sweet.
That's so pretty.
Wohh! Check it out!
A way that I love testing out
tablets is with the details.
So I have this painting here
I really like to go in
So I'm gonna try that.
Look at this.
8192 levels of sensitivity.
That is insane!
I like it.
I think that's kind of funny.
Before and and after.
Ooooo! Look at that!
Oh my god!
Hey guys, welcome back.
Oh my god.
It was like so smooth.
Just an FYI.
Another really cool highlight
Any last words you wanna say?
Huh? Do you breathe fire?
Do you breathe fire?
I'm super excited.
Ooo look at this!
Look at this glove.
Isn't that cool?
they've just sent this to me
it's a 21.5
it wasn't very big files
the screen is very shiny
they seem so similar
don't get me wrong the
great value
I really like the big screen
the size is 10.1
thanks to the large screen
but the good things
we talked a little about this
its take run to till 3 hours
it is still able to run well
yes out of
see you and thank you
hello everyone today
m10k pro drawing tablet
it's accurate line
quality is good
it's really good all right
it's priced around you as 70
we have this usb cable
this is usb type
there is no pen stand
quality is pretty solid
and here at the side
this is for holding the pen
the tapered ends
they are very firm
it's not that straightforward
i have with the mango s
driver is when i start my mac
this pen is very sensitive
it's very smooth
sensitive scroll wheel
it's really sensitive
i'm using the usbc adapter
in which case
it's going to be disorienting
it's very disorienting
and the pen
it's very sensitive
it is worth mentioning that
I'm working on
I ever tried
So really really nice
[of] desktop real estate
Now this medium version.
I think is the best buy
hi everyone today
so it's really accessible
it has two cameras
that sounds really great here
for only $79
this has none of those issues
button here to load up your
it's got the full version of
Windows this is Windows
you do have a card
slot for a micro SD card
you've got a micro
so you can plug in a standard
it didn't work on here
so this is it
there are two cameras on here
the color on the display
looks very nice
it comes in much slower and
gigahertz Wireless n radio
it's not supporting AC
we looked at just last week
Word here running on it
Windows app would install
I've got a Bluetooth keyboard
be book v3 ultra book
I like the build quality
I think you'll be fine
thanks for watching
let's check this one out.
now right when
I saw the box and its quality
and you might ask me
why is that important
whatever you get two
the pen feels very light.
the pen is battery free
oh wow look at that
the pen holder holds the pen
it really felt premium
fun fact
MuBotso lame. human
I'm just kidding
use it or not
sorry about that.
on my note 9
you're using you can edit
that's who you on did
leave a comment
they are very nice people
this is a new model for 2017
so this is the $79 version
OS 5 layout you
so this tablet
it's 13 ounces
right here
so it's got more
RAM so yeah the speed
I mean they're alright
get rid of the reflections
OS layout got the apps
you can move stuff around
I like about the tablet
this is a 16 gigabyte model
it's kind of weird
it's really easy
I got a different tutorial
got all their stuff on here
you can use tuning radio
so that's cool feature
they have an onboard
help guide
this thing called word runner
it wasn't on by default
because it's like 189
you got encryption
hey what's going on guys
welcome back to another video
really quick okay
there's not much to it
let's crack it open
all right okay
tablet is not too bad
you guys can see the specs
it's looking good
here's this brush
the rock button charging port
we have the stereo speakers
two sim cards or one sim card
according to the manufacturer
there's the headphone jack
it looks premium
i do like that detail
so let's turn it on
and straight out of the box
we can see it here
four gigs of ram
here you have the night light
not so cold white
we can see the eight cores
let's play some titles here
like this you could
i think this
that's the screen protector
the calls are vibrant
i like it
yeah not too bad guys
let's play another one
okay guys so
you have it guys
another thing i find helpful
yeah guys overall
i think this is a nice tablet
gigs of internal storage
one thing
it's a big plus
yeah i think it's a good unit
let's check it out
I do like that size
I don't like anything smaller
funny like tricky
I think it's nice and thin
it seems well-built
it's USB see
maybe it's just what
it did seem nice
it seemed comfortable
so you'll be supporting me
its gesture control is fine
it works well
you could do either
it's really enjoyable
I'll show you here
it's just one driver
it was very responsive
so we finally have it
i play 20.
and what are we getting
glass covered full hd screen
the resolution is 1920x1200
it's ips of course
but what else do we have
not that most people mind
it's very slow to charge this
here you can see
i am sure of it
i will be testing it out
they're actually okay
the volume of them
it's 16 by 10 aspect ratio
you can see
it's starting to then change
touch response is great
this screen is really good
very little bloatware
i have noticed that
wise very good
legends there okay
prime video
in fact netflix
so this is one area that okay
does it bottleneck the system
so that's one area
this is a low score
look at the weak area
well away from my router
the battery life
this is one of my own videos
no starter no lag no problems
have the sim cards in there
quality is okay
you don't actually see this
the screen is looking pretty
any pixels
it's still playable
that is a lot lighter
it is terrible
often webcams are overlooked
panel with good brightness
it's terrible really
it is playable
that's not a huge lemon
which often they are
it's a more premium model
it's the huawei mate pad pro
hey dream chasers
it's jc and a while ago
let's let's go
let's just get into it
and it's double-sided
this is cool
um but you know what i think
this is so cool
that opened up
i didn't know it opened up
i like it
i know
i promise you so
i tried it out with my laptop
it just worked cool beans
you know what they say
let's stay professional
that isn't like that
it has a nice texture to it
the pen pressure is good
this is a good choice
i just want to mention
it's deeply personal to me
but finding your way back
there's a button for that too
let me know that too
all right
it does support
the screen is 10.1 inches
they're so charged
time is a little slow
C cable in white
there is a pogo port
I can cover that
it scratched our camera on
this is our sim tray
it supports two nano
SIM door micro SD card type
there's no static
the loudness is good
I've heard phones
do it a lot better
doesn't really feel cheap
the power button
it's not bad now
the glass is 2.5
there's no creaking noises
it doesn't feel cheap
wait a little bit heavier
we're all a little bit choppy
this still isn't perfect okay
scroll down to the bottom
that's causing this
the lowest brightness sitting
we're not seeing a warm white
ok jumping now onto the ROM
a game will take that
I used to swipe up like that
you will not see
as well
we have a depth of brightness
Widevine level cert 3
ok not good so that means
you will not have full
hey Leo X 20
is that good
GPS works well
accuracy of two meters now
this surprised me
GPS but it actually works
it is again
so you can see
calls call
quality seems fine
last t30 is pretty good
battery life
surprised me okay
I'll give you a sample here
just a movie clip
I found with some games
Terminator 2 get down
this is a very large PDF
I'm looking at here
it was up to 38 degrees
where did he go
performance is good
what you're listening to is
they are bad okay
and that is it
okay so just to recap
I'll start with the positives
pubsey quite choppy
dual sim support
GPS support FM radio
that build is decent
that is really really good
Netflix and Full HD
not the tablet for it
it's just still not perfect
ok you don't see major
the wireless is ok
ThinkPad x1 tablet
not so much then
yeah it's it's kind of great
one of the other
Y low-power CPUs
we have the full court
it's it's really enjoyable
Ram 8 or 16 gigs
and that is soldered on board
I've seen some literature
obviously this is a very thin
tablet 8.9 millimeters
so what they give you
well this one
is your little ink pen pink
it's very rubbery
put them together
they weigh about 2.8 pounds
ThinkPad x1 yoga territory
the glass is Gorilla
it's a four core
it's really maintaining
that's pretty good stuff
performance is nice on this
CPU but I rarely heard it
so that was pretty impressive
the back will get warm
it's quite good
nice but there's no
so surface pro is notoriously
sealed is glued together
so so
the trackpad is pretty good
Pogo pin connectors the
Pro though is the fact
hello camera yeah not often
LTE module on the side
brightness 396 nits
this is a crazy
bright display
obviously it's got some glare
change here
inch ultra bug
this one has really good
yes but there
it is the drawback is just
it's kind of annoying
this video is also a giveaway
you can win
it's easy now
I also have to say that
the tablet and the pan
I have to say that
I need a new computer
no other things so
it's different from the
Cintiq that I own
and here's the thing
it's not that different
it's crazy and even if that
Talbot came with a stand
you don't need to spend more
this one is good enough
I get mad over the Cintiq
you can get this on amazon
we have the tablet
we have a thank you card
we have our sim ejector tool
so here is the tablet itself
it's got a good weight to it
it's not super heavy
i haven't installed anything
it's got your gps
it doesn't have any face
no lag here looks pretty good
so here is google
i just googled
don't really see any lag here
okay so here
look pretty good
i didn't notice any lag
we can only use balanced
it doesn't look too bad
okay so here
i noticed for the camera
also isn't that bad either
which isn't that bad
it's good material
it's a solid tablet
sound is definitely loud
quality is okay
quality is also really good
but other than that
thank you guys for watching
hey everyone in today's video
I'm going to review the deco
XP pen in this video
what the driver can do
this is extremely solid
it's just nice
so this is the tablet
so this is what
this is very interesting
they will also light up
it's really nice
nice very solid and now
once you click it
you can just a pressure curve
this is nice
this is not very useful
this is the mapping area
it's very light
it's also very smooth
it's actually quite good
so it's not too slippery
it's really sensitive
it works really well
this is on
this is a still me me max
3 with a really huge screen
so let me open up our flow
so that's pretty cool
no issues here now
this app that
the line quality you can get
it's excellent lines
I'm quite impressed by this
this is us $129

I'll be showing you guys
just the right amount
this tablet uses a USB port
the pen has like over 300
I have my own PEM tablet
I'm showing you on the left
I've had for ages anyway
okay so usually
D tablet was working pretty
I got into the painting
we made some progress
I'm actually quite liking
I did forget to mention you
I think I'll get this tablet
a solid b-plus
and it's perfectly functional
this is the
so what is this thing
it's a pen display basically
pop up over the last year
it's not too big
what on earth does that mean
Huli on products
if you really wanted to
you could take it off
it has a standard release
latch on it
lets you set it at any angle
I've never seen that before
works pretty well
I never do that
it is pretty light
the pen is also battery free
it holds pressure
well fast hats lines do well
I'm not getting any fish
hooks on those lines
so today's question
why not
I often do even appropriate
when you draw with a stroke
it had good color
and of course as always i
hey guys so in today's video
I think of it so first
well if you know me you know
but it's not cheap
I kind of like that about it
I know that sounds strange
there is a downside
it's not completely smooth
so you know
I posted this video
the lines move
the size is nice
I hope it was okay
okay text you later bye

just an observation
I yeah each to their own
because it's at least
oh my mail my my talk
sorry about the lighting
wiki and printer share
so you can
I really think that you know
you know there's now
because that's where most
I think that with what's out
it is a good tablet
just not the sexiest thing
I'm doing it for charity
thanks for watching guys
we'll speak to you soon
to have because
There's our driver.
however you want.
No matter what.
That is sweat.
The price is also quite high
I will say that the one thing
I guess not about this huh
that way
the rest of it is actually
okay um
it's not ambled
I'm reading comics
everything looks pretty good
it looks good um again
yeah no complaints
I'm in a room right now
watch this see that see
it's not horrible
it's not amazing
I'm mostly okay with that
okay moving on to audio
they shop in three two one
yeah so on this
so what is it about this that
it's not good as you can see
let me launch something else
so let you guys see let's say
I launched YouTube
let's let's launch
and yeah you can see that was
okay before we move on to you
know the rest of the tablet
I I was
I think it was
that's one of the reasons why
I think I played for you guys
let's go again
it's a very old crap
I died
let's move on to a pub
G Arness right now
whatever same price
very very addicting
oh my goodness it's so so bad
I I couldn't believe it
okay alright guys
I did miss something
do i recommends this tablet
you don't need a great tablet
put it that way alright
that's it for this review
some say that it's very good
let's talk about the hardware
this is much more convenient
it's those pots that
the light will stay on
this is tablet driver version
v 11.0 point 8
I'm using a 4k monitor
this is the mapping area
it's pretty straightforward
as for the pen
I like pen
that is as light as a pencil
let me show you the stand
that comes with the pen
this is the stand
yes there is the bottom
this is photoshop
that is good friction
there is good control
so let's
sometimes they have problems
so this is pretty standard
alright okay
my pen is on the surface now
let's try
I've drawn something
let's try this
they are predictable
they go where
I want em to be so
yeah this is one
this is sketches
Pro and it works
some of them work
some of them do not work
and lastly the pricing
Wacom tablet at this size
there are balls so for us $80
yo like this video now
os-- it's great
yeah little wispy suppose
I don't care wow I'm at
I'm number five on the board
I am reviewing one
what am the heat
one one
loads off next is the pen
this is only really cool
there's a paperwork first
put out
I've actually used a tablet
that isn't a display so
I'm gonna take this
some of the specs for this
I have to download the driver
there is no power cable
connect this to it
it feels very flimsy to me
it's not it's not heavy
you can't really beat it
it's also going to you know
do both hands covered
which means that
remove the box cover
we're gonna talk about that
a warranty card
I hate this pen
going back to the p0
I really wanted to talk about
you go for the g6
actually fourth row
wait for it to finish
this is my piece of paper
its finishes are very well
this is something like that
hey this is a tablet that
for me personally
which was a big plus
of course you know
okay I'm gonna get going now
it's 6:30 a.m.
See what I did there?
It's 13.3 inches diagonally.
but it will do the trick.
The bezel design of the Wacom
Now let's discuss the pen.
This here is legit.
Adobe Fresco is coming soon.
So for example
So who is the Wacom One for?
And now for some comparisons.
And now for the price.
The Wacom One sells for $399.
The pros of the Wacom
And now for the cons.
that's on your desk.
And now for my conclusion.
I'm also happy to see
One is not a tablet computer.
so just how good is it
it is a super simple device
it's really smooth
it's really easy to write on
there is like no lag
I make a mistake
actually you know
I'll give you a quick example
it's really accurate you know
Peaks later or anything
that's one of the reasons
I find they super useful
this is a review unit
that was sent to me from
we have the warranty card
the design feels quite solid
it's towards the lighter side
buttons have a nice quicky
feel to them and tip here
it's quite firm
and this is that tablet
I like the design
the corners are rounded off
we have this red color
scroll down and here
it uses a slider
you can assign specific
I have already assigned mine
box and click
this is Photoshop on the Mac
this is quite responsive
the pen is very sensitive
I mean zoom in
so the curves here
they are really quite smooth
let me show you how
well the line is tapered
really well right now
I want to show you is higher
swiss caches
we see some marks here
drawing on this
I like the pen case
and the look so this is
I hope this is helpful
thanks for watching
see you in the next video bye
I'm also testing it
I also test multitasking
it can happen
that one is not supported
but that's very rare one game
I tried is a new
Call of Duty
glass shows a new
as much for $150
the performance is good
you can play most games
it has the same 10.1
around it are quite big
it has a fully plastic body
I decided to get the blue one
its back fast
so if you don't want that
there's a micro
SD card slot
a tablet has two speakers
I used for the 2017 version
we get eggs
but not all
Amazon stuff everywhere
I installed the Play
I recommend this tablet
the graphics
Android updates too
hey everyone in today's video
this is a review unit
the driver supports both
Windows and Mac OS
we'll connect this later
I like the design
looks very slick
on this site
maybe laughing right
we have this nice pattern
can you see the pattern
is dot matrix pattern here
looks really cool
this is a very thin tablet
looks really good for our us
they behave like that
so this part here
Windows as well
so here you can choose to map
there's the option here
you can choose from
okay so these are the strokes
I drew so notice
let's take a look at
unfortunately for me
they don't have pressure
I'm not sure why that happens
delete the wind tab drivers
thanks for watching
tab 3 it cost 7 $29.99
it's a 10.1
inch tablet that runs full
Windows 8
this is a 10.1 inch tablet
it's less than an inch wide
oh it better be given
so it does include
I like this thing
like a little click pad
that doesn't happen so well
that's very good
the display is 10.1 inches
it also gets very bright
it also runs full
and it has an Intel Atom
you can find other
try or don't buy this item
it's very nice it's very fun
hello internet world

oh that's an old one
let's get rid of that one
we go this is one
I did just recently
they're very very clear
we've also got some photos

I also forgot to mention
China branded products
Samsung Sony HTC Apple
I'm not gonna lie
Samsung's Galaxy Tab 7
you know sorry
have a great day guys peace
this is one point
it's very satisfying
it's a very fast process here
Core M processor
kickstand so on the surface
this one sits more flat
it really does lay flat
nice design in here
this is a ThinkPad keyboard
through-and-through same size
there is a backlight on here
I was expecting a louder
sound out of this
but it does sound okay
lock as well
your power switch is up here
on the top
USB port as a pen holder
I get the pen
we've got that
AC Wireless built in
I don't see any drop frames
here too now
I'm doing here
that are not going to tax
I've got a blu-ray MKV
playing here right now
this is the one
this is lines
i've been thanks for watching
it's a 10-inch
here's tablet itself
I wanted to look at right now
is the ports on the side
headphone jack and here
we have two micro
and it's pretty responsive
so that's just roughly
how games work on this tablet
you can take it places
so it's pretty portable
here it's removable
right here
so it's decently accurate
I made a few errors
the the connection
thanks for watching
what's happening everyone
around 9,000 milliamp battery
this is the jumper easy pad
six pro tablet that runs
we get the Intel and 3450 CPU
this is a quad-core CPU
um than a tablet one thing
I don't really like about
once again
that comes with this device
this is somewhat slower
they do work very very well
this is the same file -
I love the screen
I love how big it is
I'm imagining that
definitely go for it alright
thanks for watching
what's happening everyone
outers so this one
so just over 720p
the colors look good
the viewing angles are good
they don't sound that great
tablet is probably not ideal
the battery life on it
isn't that amazing
it's a bit challenging to you
so keep that in mind
the battery life isn't great
thanks for watching
I should mention overall
As a basis
That’s it.
be a certain way.
And they police this.
email lists and social media.
That’s actually illegal
This is product testing.
Never agree to test tablets.
They don’t.
You have the power here.
I did.

TouchWiz is fairly clean
Android experience TouchWiz
I actually kind of like it
now here
you see the stock
here's s note on this side
let me go back to s note
I try to scroll here
it is in an inactive state
the browser works
Polaris Office s
Samsung wants to change that
you just have more precision
we hope you like this
numbers come by the site
also the full
Windows 10 your Lynx vision
but what's the point
it's great now
the color is okay
it's certainly nowhere
it looks really good on
two handles one on the left
it's very similar to the
just doesn't feel quite right
this is a great solution
it works very well
the battery lasts very well
great tablet though
hey what's up guys this is
this tablet also supports
it has plenty of power
it has 21.3
let's go and set it up
then hit next
I'll choose a pattern
you can do your gallery
from the three lines
so let's say for example
okay that's that max volume
taken on this tablet overall
this is a pretty good tablet
point of 449
don't try it also
SD card slot actually works
grates right here
you can see
Jack your power button
so it's a nice looking tablet
this is at maximum brightness
inch displays
it costs a lot of money
there's a side view
it's about 1 pound 12 ounces
it's almost 1.7 pounds
you get a lot less
so you've got that dual core
it gets 41 on
we'll talk about later
we're in the bookstore view
let's go do that
it's a web browser
requirement feed books
we've got cute
page turn animations probably

it looks like you poked
it's cute
well let locally start
1080p video
didn't go too well
really lovely interface here
it's doing better here
you can see here
it comes with honeycomb
the browser is excellent
but how much does that matter
it doesn't the game
very nice now
that's sealed inside
it's still doing that
you have her camera
you have a mini
oh sorry not microphone
let's look at the bezels
bezels are fairly big
they're not too small
I mean they're fine
it's not the best again
that's decent screens
you get screens
I use LCDs most of my life
most of them are better
I mean I think
and this actually does help
there's one more thing
stand my battery life
I left it for
as you can see here
I don't really care that much
it works well
this is very well optimized
it's pretty much as whoops
Chrome was super fast
that's also instant
most of the time
I'm not sure what's going on
so there's that's not good
the performance is not bad
I don't know why it crashes
I am impressed with it
well on today's episode
hey guys what's going on
it has 16 gigs of memory
RAM it's 10.1
it has dual sim capabilities
it has a 3.5
mm stereo jack

same place next week
jack and a sim tray
it is just a smooth and blank
we can see that
apps to test the tablet

Android 4.4.2 kitkat
UI skin on top of Android
Lenovo calls bottom switch

you need to adjust your hand
and it's something
you really can't go wrong
make sure you like this video
Android take care
nice colors on there
this screen is 1280 by 800
I'm looking at it in here
it's got 16 gig of storage
which like I said
I'll just turn it off
the material design yet
Asus said yes
I'm not that keen on
I'm actually there
let's just run the volume up
that's clear actually
I really like that screen
considered is 1280 by 800
Android is just cost
you can go for gadget
let's just go see it there
I guess you it's not bad idea
yeah there you go
I found here
I use a lot on my Lumia phone
so you've got it
I miss that one
it's not on other devices
I use so I've just tried a
this seems fairly reasonable
I'm attending choose
it's not expensive
we'll have to wait and see
it feels quite nicely made
starting at just $279
we're getting a desktop class
I'm and reformed on
I'm reviewing pretty much
you can connect use
that's certainly a downside
ratios that videos
but the frame is unprotected
sure it might be because
yes ideas that means
it's fully desktop class
Android tablets here
not all but most
Chrome OS is based on Linux
it's quite bright with 400
you can watch
the performance is excellent
that's the case regarding
I did manage to end the video

Xavier calm
hi guys come in here so today
so let's do an unboxing
let's peel off the plastic
so first is the tablet itself
that's very nice in the head
it's very late
Store it still
it doesn't support that
thanks for watching guys
hello i'm here
he's a chill little guy
i really like how it looks
we'll go through
what else in the box
it's got a little usb
um plug in it
it's very simple
little cylindrical box
this is the pen itself
it's not a chargeable pen
so that's nice
no batteries
no charging or anything
it's not as long as it looks
it's like the hdmi
which plug goes where
i'm an idiot
this is the stand
we're back to this bad boy
that's applicable to you
the response is really nice
the pressure is really nice
it wouldn't quite pick it up
it was just on occasion
they're like oh do i do
i love the silver and black
it's very it's very sleek
i mean the choices
i was drawing so i was like
yeah that's it um
i'll see you again sometime
see you later you
these are my tyd tablets now
the box is the tablet itself
you get a stylus
you'd put a nano
so that's what's in the box
you also get a plug charger
10.1 inch screen is
it's not a glass screen
it's a plastic screen
so that's the only reason why
the back is that's metal
obviously plastic round
just turn it on
it always useful
see what's going on
Wi-Fi click on there
it's a little bit tinny
but reduce it in size
nice and quick to charge
they hold the charge
easy to set up can't go wrong
what's up guys
it was around 100 bucks so
it can tell it
it's a pretty cheap quality
it's what you expect
I already set it up
it looks great
so that's a good sign
so that's a positive thing
so you can get
I don't really like the bezos
let's talk about the cameras
well it's looking pretty good
it's nothing too impressive
it's a two megapixel camera
this tablet is first
also as a pre for $100 tablet
hit that like button
TV this is the symbols tango
display means you're knockin
and that's what
I've noticed
I'll show you in a minute
Wi-Fi it does 2.4
and 5 gigahertz networks also
USB mini HDMI full USB port
that's a full-size USB port
you also get right here
if you want to get there
this is also a lot of time
let's turn the volume up
sound is like
I said absolutely horrendous
pretty good on this
let's push this video
see how high we can push it
that's at 360
let's put it that
looks like the highest
it's not a 1080p screen
load up quick
actually this is
I can play this one
let's check out some games
I'm gonna die
oh he's catching up to me
see if I can get running
I'm not good at any game
I ever did on this game
oh my gosh
are you supposed to do that
yeah you can see it
let's just load up a website
click on one of these stories
how about Elon
Musk from the guy from Tesla
you could take photos
it's a cool little tab
that one's 129 as well
so link down below
all right so
I'm super late for dinner
that is a problem but anyway
I'll talk later about that
so let's try
iOS 13
this is weird
there is a ton of dust here
so it's pretty much an a4
does this say anything
I mean I yeah why not
I don't mind it
it's totally ok
I'm not angry about it
it's fine yes
oh yeah this is filthy
just barely sad
this is so i was saying that
this is amazingly large
it's pressure sensitive
it is with the pen
yeah so that is adequate
it is the question and no
so that's that's nice
there's no locally raised
there's absolutely no way
OCD isn't as bad
it isn't evolved
it bothers me mildly
it's pretty good
you can see that
what else
I had no idea the lock
it's it's fully analog
I'm sorry so
what is this like
this is 400 euros
used is what I paid for this
it has some some
Wacom style surface pink
it's a lot of money right
I love it this is how I do it
I'm I'm fine with it
the ink is fine
that is a bummer
UI runs super fast
that's that's a bummer
what else can I say about it
it's a nice tablet
I mean for a prototype
it is incredibly well
so the front display sheet
well not super clicky
it fits the pen very snugly
well so you if you find on
I think 90 times up until now
so yeah alright come on
all wrapped
up in a super thin chassis
thanks to the powerful
tablet isn't a problem at all
this is fresh water
more casual use
that couldn't be more true
Android tablet well
this is the Huyen canvas 13
hello my name is
thirteen is a pen display
inch display to be exact
and that's what this pen
I think it nails that landing
here's how it works
all you need is creativity
it comes in three colors
I wish I went with the purple
just because it's different
take it brand
this is a laminated screen
this increases your accuracy
it is a nice step forward
feels good when
I'm drawing
Studio Medi bang
they're just on the
there are two drawing gloves
no no you cannot make me
what does come in
you can order that
I have cables like that
but here's my problem
it's sunk in a little bit
it requires a special cable
those tend to be more pricey
no it's here so
I couldn't test this I was
I was really disappointed
I couldn't test those either
and so instead I I googled
and jeez it's $40
Android devices over on who
it doesn't open it
my best paint
whoo yawn themselves
it's fairly new
it's fully operational here
goes full screen
Wacom one this is a cool idea
I have no problem with saying
go for it have fun
that are very similar to this
I mange for my next ever calm
who would have thought that
DTaP m7 with a metal body
we're getting a micro
the sound quality is bad
the speaker sounds flat
it was fine for everybody
I like that
it's not a top performer
gigabyte internal storage

I well that I've noticed
the artist series
Nikolaas screen so once again
I wish for this version
that's going to be identical
so which is my naked eye
the surface feels good
I tested all the usual
I'm getting used to it
that's very fine
is that everything
I have this one
that's a great place to be
now where do you think
the artist 15.6 bro
it's a little bit slimmer
looks better to me

it turns it back your life
I've been finding well
I forget about five hours

I'd say it's a very nice
but that's more of that again
I think works really well
that's both economical

that's none of that online
spend me up quite a bit now
I'm used to working with
Wacom tablets
that's a good thing
seems like on my old
but that wasn't the case here
I've used in
I want to touch upon
though is the stand
own rep who said yeah
Twitter right now
it's really cool drying up
built in
tips or nibs
then you get the pen itself

the pen is battery free
1200 display now
it's much much more natural
it looks absolutely fantastic
and what
i really do appreciate it
thanks for watching
i'll see you next time
hi everyone so

I said it's tiny
Wii on pin tablet driver
it is replaceable
it's a detachable me
Mac OSX tuna
that is the bet aside
I'm using paint tool
I found myself getting lost
losing the cursor
remember the active area on
this tablet is 4 inches by 2
Photoshop is iffy
I recommend it to beginners
it is cheap though
$30.00 is amazing
I have no idea
so there is another option
i'm releasing this
it should be this week
i'll talk to you soon
so what comes in the box
uh feeling fabric
i thought it was a nice touch
labs medium tablet
it's awesome
i did confirm from them
it comes in lower
it's premium grade material
that's the company
i'm gonna leave it here
love you peace so you
hello this is simason corner
good standard what you get in
you need to get started
it's pretty standard stuff
i also want to mention now
what do these numbers mean
but we're not done here yet
hello this is simracing nice
um wow that's metal as well
that's pretty robust
i have to say i did know that
can you see the screen there
come on you completed
now what killed him i did
get his weapon
you'll need for this level
soon find the generator
not don't forget
go to the generator
of course
there is a 3.5
it's top marks for most users
it is a winning combination
and i do love a bargain
okay let's wrap up the review
this was announced
and this is the sony
i love mine in july 2015 and
they are living by that
it is not much to see either
you have a camera
it's the power button
i have it open in many times
of course
you have the micro
rocker is painted black
which gives you it
listen to music
read news surf the web
check my email with this
which is you know boring
it is a 10.1 inch at IPS
Sony's TV marketing
that was a big problem
its got three gigs of ram
it is a quad
it is pretty quick
we go obviously
I'm going to skip out of this
the point is
Croft go
which is a new game
we go deletion the reason
I like this game so much
this really is all
I can change the size
they could make it thinner
they could make it lighter
Snapdragon to the a20
simple very utilitarian
same goes for the sony scheme
for android it's minimal
you know a big step forward
that didn't quite work
and it's impressive
it is still in my opinion
it is very good
that's too bad
I use it every day
I use it when traveling
i usually run at home
that's what I use it for
you can get more round
xperia set for tablet
I can play two games
I really love them
and that's a big game
so that's why
it's running the 801 chipset
I'm looking forward to that
but for everyone else
so that's my opinion on that
we have the nuke 7 tablet
you might be saying well
this has been out for a while
check it out
I'm not going to lie
it looks pretty normal
yeah we have the back
nothing on the bottom
we're not going to show you
anything like that
so we're just going to start
I shouldn't chose that one
you can buy these in the text
it just it
thanks for the set up
it's a tablet
you do have a page animation
so really cool
it's kind of like oh
don't rip the paper
you know something like that
so yeah it's very cool
let's go back to there
oh this one sorry
of course
there's shops apartment
we're not going to go through
every single one of those
I like the way they do this
and it's very intuitive
Barnes & Noble
read out
we're going to go back to
so you can click the middle
we go some sunglasses
well look at some sunglasses
it's it's pretty good
it always has been and yeah
we're wrapping up here so
I'm just going to say this
we're like wow
it's like you know
quad core dual cameras
I don't really like that
puzzles are fantastic
sorry for the long video
a pin display tablet
it doesn't work on its own
it's not like normal tablets
it feels quite spacious gama
it has a good amount of keys
it comes with a stand
it's very nice
which are the common colors
it hasn't changed at all
it has 8,192 pressure levels
maybe it's too soft
have more wires than this
it's very nice
it's a cool touch
do we sell the tablet
I really really like this
it's amazing unfortunately
what you saw
because that's the only thing
I'm using right now
can you believe that
I made so many mistakes
the light source
it's so unclear and
it looks a little creepy
not gonna lie
this is not how
let's be honest
it's a very foggy
I've never started
I always forget everything
that's it for this video
srt-6 kay tires now
also we like that
headers for a stock card
all you do is select the tune
we were pleasantly surprised
at how much more linear the
driving experience
the only audible difference
all right bonding 85
negative on the tablet
to put it through its paces
that's it for this episode
hi my name is Ashley
so that can be used once
you both know that
Safari the vga
how fast and there we go
obviously this is a latitude
I looked not much of work

you're not going to lose it
Express keys here
I've got it orientated
then this second button here
you can even add
I've got some photos
I'm going to select my paint
brush here and here
let's see how this goes
here's the thing though
this is her modern version
I got came with the tablet
speaking of fire safety
here's a character design tip
voila the sketch is done
I started with the basics
and here's the final product
if you're interested
it's very budget-conscious
it's very budget-friendly
this is a $399 tablet
we're gonna unbox it galette
pinky boo do the unboxing
then we're gonna do some art
what comes that little hard
let's see here there
we go there we go
you've actually never used
yeah let's see here so
this is the clips
chargin okay lots of wires
this is the wacom one
this is my 13-inch Cintiq
it's close to get sturdy
I mean it is very sturdy
compare this to the 13-inch
Wacom one however
and then look at this
there's one connector
so there is that
they had laptops of mind
Wacom which is good right
I mean for $399
it's it's very sturdy
you can definitely you know
you know it's it's a wacom
okay guys so
so let's um let's pick
this is in the clip studio
so they're your real pencil
I think I mentioned it before
is that the stylus on
they'd be here neither ways
no pressure no pressure chalk
you can blend stuff
they do and you can you know
Oh what
I've noticed that I knew dude
I know I do have one
that's a cue
this is well now
she looks like she's from
Lilly okay guys
I'm going to wrap this up
it's first time
um final thoughts yeah
it does start at $399 for a
Wacom screen tablet
that's incredibly cheap
the performance is great
it is 4096 levels
I know those of you out there
it is a 13.3
inch display
it does not support
I was very confused
it's very light
but if you're on the go
you know pinky boo she's 12
it's definitely for the money
it's a buy for me again
Wacom tablet I recommend it
we'll talk to you guys later
thanks so much for watching
go to clownfish support
that's clownfish talk comm
we will talk to you next time
they're calling it
plus you can add more it
this tablet runs
I was watching after that
none of which
the price has increased
the screen is ok just ok
this is it
you're looking at video
shot with it right now so
that are coming out
fortunately the headphone
jack means
you shouldn't have to
it'll take slightly longer
I hope that changes soon
something else unfortunately
Fire HD 8 is a no brainer
I'm at Erin lyy see
I'm grant Abbott and today
with the graphics tablets
LPI blah blah blah
I've worked with graphics
do the drivers work

I'm very impressed

USB card micro SD card
sorry the front camera is 0.3
i like it
it is very sleek
it's actually very light
and it's on
there's no on or off button
that is doable
in this tablet
it was really hard to use
it was really hard
it took me forever
it wasn't perfect at all
don't give up
so that's what i did
when i was coloring
it takes practice
i think it turned out
i'm pretty sure
only a portion of the tablet
alright guys well
i hope you all enjoyed it
hey guys here
what makes this tablet really
it has a 1 gigahertz
ARM Cortex processor
this is actually the exact
and that's pretty much
there's nothing on the bottom
and it's easy to read
viewing angle
this is very impressive
it's gonna light up
and that's basically it
but again you can see here
we can shoe up to 720p
and so it's a good tablet
it can also see here cup
Store application
we're watching videos again

the pan
Android tablet so
the barnes & noble devices

eight out of ten
let's open it up
this is the tiniest tablet
lay you off to the side
nibs wear out
these are tiny
so we've got our tablet
we've got our pen
that's also very expensive
it's 50 60 bucks a month
you're drawing it
zooming in isn't bad at all
that was ok so
part of that is at this point
my hand was pretty tired
so the Galman PD
is that the screen protector
you might say blue
just rub them out man
dude it's super easy
ma'am ha ha
I've tried a lot for months
just keep in mind
you just select the button
and that's cool
I am unworthy of this
this tablet is good

it's very fluid
it does feel pretty good
the only problem
I did have with my drivers
this one's a bit tricky
nice experience
it is very similar to a

it's just all fairly obvious
so it's it's quite compatible
thank you very much
Katy sixteen screen tablet
Wacom screen tablet that

I calibrated the tablet
I had is that a few times
stand the pen is really nice
I'm using a default Photoshop
I'm not using anything

sensitivity is lovely
I didn't have any problems
working with the tablet
that's my final
and today we'll be
is the back camera
this is the speaker
and here's the front camera
and here's the stylus
and you just tie the end
there's a stand in the back
google don't hit the bomb

don't lose them please
it's a Phillips screwdriver
I'm recording with one hand
this is kind of hard open it
it's pretty easy
I'll show you in a second see
Yap format it

I call a power adapter
it just goes into it
don't lose that please
I was like
that's all done
oh my gosh
it's working again
not a pen display tablet
when you do that
it's pretty easy
I doubt it
and here is my review
to the right
grilles this is a 10 inch ips
fhd resolution
it can't manage multitasking
you should also realize that
this may be enough
this is particularly good
hissing sounds they worked
smart tablet is your choice
it is very understandable
this is the Samsung Galaxy
Tab s 10.5
let's puts this beautiful
hi this is
Office at it now
Exynos octa-core processor
s due to that
Super AMOLED display
on this tablet
this is an ideal solution
it just weighs 467 grams
because even at max volume
have a look at this
Samsung Galaxy Tab s 10.5
this is the week 15
let me just this side
we have this cart
this is the stand for the pen
oh okay so
it's very solid
it's very simple and clean
it's actually quite solid
I like the design
I like the rounded corners
it looks very slick alright
this is mapping
the left hand mode
Windows ink on or off
so he can assign mouse clicks
this is the pen eraser toggle
I may reduce the brush
it's better now
it's much smoother
let me try the scroll wheel
lag the lines
they also respond to pressure
I've just corrected
I don't see any jitter
it's not as smooth
it's smoother this is
it's a horizontal rectangle
I'm using a toothbrush
I reviewed have this
this is clip studio
paint pressure
works really well
this is also very responsive
I expect them to so
that's fantastic
it doesn't work so by default
this is a drunk tablet
$60 it looks good
it's well-built
I've tested on Windows
that works with computers
Android phones and tablets.
Android devices only.
What’s in the box?
Adaptors for the cable.
It won’t work below that.
Just plug it in and play.
Those only work on computers.
For computer use
you need to install a driver.
Go to huion.com/download.
Type in HS64.
Right click, extract.
Double click the installer.
Install. Plug your tablet in.
And the last tab
And for $35, that’s a steal.
It’s so cheap!
You really do need a phone
stand for this, though.
I’m very lucky
That’s it, really.
Hope this helps!
S but if anything
S on paper
it's a bit underwhelming
4 smart phone
it's not strong in the bass

that's pretty much it
this is a 22 inch tablet

you've got spendings in there
Wacom thing across the top

I only use a Wacom pen
Wacom pen when I used a mouse

I certainly again
well thanks for watching
hi this is
Acer also has a 10-inch model
this is the 11 inch model
this version was loaned to me
I think you know it's a
Windows tablet range
that's sort of your default
125 percentage resolution
they're reasonably loud
Windows 8
this is the h 610
why is drawing on
Android so special anyhow
I think through a lot of you
especially those of you
who subscribe
who are regulars here
this is a pretty cool thing
I've done over on my website
Goldilocks size too
it loves finger prints
some people collect stamps
this collects finger prints
the build is good enough
those are soft keys
their tap opal shortcut keys
they're probably getting away
it's a little bit textured
you might be wondering
nibs well yeah
the pressure comes out
Windows or on a Mac
playing around with
A with S Pen
it worked really well
Kansai - yeah softly
sleep hurry up
I'm not singing anymore
I'm just curious
hey my kids interested in art
there is one major caveat
Chromebook this works
what do you think
that is all
I have for today
thank you guys for watching
well i know like such uh lcd
where without wasting paper
you can practice your line
i don't think we need that
i think it's quite good
that's right for 900 rupees
the lines are nice and thin
this is a handy feature
they say it lasts two years
this is a good feature
this is a good addition
you can take out your ruler
yeah and one more thing
i wish this had the stylus
so this is something
90 degree micro
I'm using the first feature
is the touch ring
I have draw
I edited some photos
that cure is a good
the functionality is good
I want to discuss over here
is that customizing options
this is a spacebar so
I'm using this this and these
click button so
so this is the default option
I you can draw light lines
so it's like
I'm using more often
so it's just my opinion
so if you're big in there
it's pro level
you can do any work of this
see you in the next video
and just what
there's a brown box
I thought was really cool
there is a pen
it is $119.99 u.s. dollars
which is really really great
that's what it's called
who young pens
it's about the same weight
it feels very natural
that way
you'll never lose it
it'll never fall out so
I really like how
I feel like the paper
with a tablet that's only 119
it's very sleek
there's no lag whatsoever
Hilla here OS reviews
this is a budget
I think it will suffice
it's actually pretty dense
it's in full color
let's just peel off the
a power on/off key
HDMI port
there's just the standard
what's also kind of neat
do get pretty loud
I can also do multitasking
by default
in terms of gestures
this might be something
go for under a hundred bucks
that's been our video
thanks for watching
hello everyone in this video
it's a Samsung Galaxy Tab
A 6 10.1
inch a 32 gig

it takes a micro
SD memory card
and the power button okay

I like about this tablet

tablet and any display tablet
I think in general is make
that is worth checking out
uh and let me tell you
a look at the back
we can see the specifications
Americans out there
I I had to take a minute
this thing is cute
okay with that tangent
I do appreciate that
I like it up next
it's lighter than the
it is lighter than the
Wacom pen as I said so
keep that in mind next
we have the micro
USB cable pretty
I'm not responsible
so the press keys again
it's pretty simple
it doesn't change instantly
I guess it's a good tablet

let's just say this
isn't that review
I'm used to in premium glass
it's hard to write that
SD card slot for expandable
and that'll help
but you won't want to why not
good for
it should have been left off
it's a potato from the 1990s
they are that bad
only that's hot aftershocks
calm news code hot
you want to browse the web
I think so
no doubt your candy
which is my kids

which is fine
it's that you get stock
but my guess is
don't go expecting much
and those words right
m106k pro drawing tablet

I would say an easier
the screen is the battery
I found the Wi-Fi connection
Buy plugin
I'm Teddy K
thanks for watching
this is a third-party tablet
the protective layer off
SD card
it's not the thinnest tablet
we have our volume rocker
we have our micro
we've got our micro
SD card slot
we also have a mini
we've got our rear camera
I had with it
one of them is called
which is actually really nice
YouTube videos
things like that
they all came down
I should mention that
which got me thinking
no input delay
we're gonna load another game
I think we'd be okay
I have towards it
I'm really happy with that
the quality on screen is good
so definitely really good
there wasn't any hiccups
I just enjoyed the gameplay
dreamcast is the redream
I did try to run
the game felt really good
the next thing
so it's kind of hit or miss
I have Dragon Ball Z
I just want to thank Van
hey what's going on guys this
Amazon Fire HD 8 plus now
it's $89.99 for the plus
Edition with three
so here it is
we now have
it's a pretty decent display
we do get dual band
5.0 it's running fire
Plus Hulu Amazon Prime
it's gonna work just fine now
you can use
so first up we have 3d mark
we got 242
GPU in the bigger tablet stop
Fire HD 8 plus and
so we were able to upscale
I've tested so far
but either way you look at it
the choice is up to you
I mentioned in this video
thanks for watching you
it's still worth the price
i highly recommend them
got our amazon link
you can shop
you got videos
i love the first one
i i i can't express enough
sales come sometimes
sometimes it's 70
it's a great tablet
it's worth it
so there you go
they just come like this
I can only be used
you'll hear it
click and feel it
Lots sort of extreme tests
little screwdriver does so
I'm a huge fan
thanks for watching
I hope that was helpful
I make that helps people
my name is
they all seem to say
I've never been able to test
its claim out myself since
ready to be unboxed
let's get to the unboxing
okay so here
QE on okay
Oh what
now here is the tablet itself
it's a lot smaller than ours
I was collecting
I have a little
so it's about almost
we have the little
it's nice black material
okay what else do we have
oh there is the stylist since
I'm just gonna go ahead
it's pretty standard here
I was using in many bang
the new tablet
you can figure it out
no particular reason
he's just a nice easy
the tablet works pretty much
I digress
it was a bit hard gauging
so here we are
you're using by the time
I wanted to mention was that
dedicated work work overall
hi this is
Brad Linder with Laputa
but unlike a lot of tablets
there's also an micro
it's it's pretty good
Netflix works
that we're playing here
so here we've got
it's not particularly cheap
but it gives you a full size
it's surprisingly close
I'll show you you know
scrolling works okay
now you'll see that
it looks pretty good
let's go ahead and do this
make these kind of things
any number of things
look at it now so clearly
this thing is very beefy
it's 11.6 inch tablets
I'll call it 12 inches
it's got a quad core
swap them out in the field
that's pretty darn nice
a thousand in that's what
Intel claims display
so it's meant for outdoor use
you can still see it
look at this thing
if you have to do
self-defense yourself
you put it together
it's not the lightest thing
V Pro for tenth gen yet
SSD anywhere from 128 gigs
the cpu chipset
ice-like isn't so super huge
the display is full
that's perfectly fine
it has an anti-glare surface
it looks kind of grainy
we've measured 887
graph is off the charts bad
that's what that's for again
II kind of keyboard
you can get a charger
that's your choice
45 watt
I'll be showing you
so there's a thank you
this is the tablet
it's a very large tablet
the buttons are all right
we're good spacing apart
they are easy to press
is this lock toggle
let me show you the stylist
there are two shot
so that's the knit
took it at an angle
you can just pull up
Nick very easily
let me switch this on first
Cisco shortcut buttons
now this is the dollars
that's the pressure curve
so that's the problem
let's start using the apps
I think it works
I just want to demonstrate
so pressure works here
let me jump over to mischief
this is a sheath pressure
works here quite nicely too
I'm using MIDI Bank paint
that is free
Troy pressure looks very well
you can see here
it's like it's a bit abrupt
it's a bit more gradual so
I have three sketches
The Strokes actually
it works fine another thing
so you actually still need
now the type of features that
I'll show you that
I plug this into my computer
I prefer 10 by 6 inches now
that's all for today's review
greetings everyone Eric
yeah the a 30
she is quite the looker
I really like the box design
it's very sleek
it's very clean
it just looks really nice
it looks professional
let's get her open
there we go right off the bat
it's very very indeed
but it's really nice
pull the pen out here
so it's very very light
don't that'll be up to you
but the buttons feel good
it feels good in the hands
I really enjoyed it
I'm trying to get stuff out
so we're gonna peel this open
you can see on the side here
I'll talk about later
alright so now
that is my bad
they allow that
which is really nice
they're not that visible
the buttons are interesting
I'm not really sure
oh that's a zoom okay
I do like the scroll thing
I do not enjoy them at all
II to it
at all tablet self feels nice
being a little inconsistent
I really like it
I like the look of the tablet
it's really good
nice and sturdy
the material is feel smooth
you can kind of see them
I could see it
I can go oh
I think it's fine
I think it's really good
and kind of jumbled
I also do streaming
that's what I'm using here
I'm using a stream
how's it going
everybody sketch monkey here
welcome back to a new video
that's all that
I'm more than happy with it
let's jump into the video
so let's jump into the video
is this chord right here
you can see that
I said yes
send it to me
not as slippery as this one
what's inside of the package
it's in two different layers
like right here
I'm gonna walk you through
should it wear out then
you need to replace it
you're comfortable with now
I want it to be more neutral
it's a warm tip
you can see them all here
she left her mark right there
that's covering the screen
we go enjoy once
everything was plugged in
what's inside of this donut
this is actually the Pakistan
can you tell the difference
second reason is
especially if you have
I never used them
so what's the verdict
yes yes we can
the sketch monkey tablet
welcome to the family
Hui on in to us
thank you for your service
there isn't much to be said
it is a lineage os
they're not super annoying
it's been more stable
i wasn't able to set it up
hope you all have a great day
stay safe and peace
who's a tablet lover
it has the fire
I put my hands on
I used it
it draws my attention
I enjoyed working with it
it has a qxga
and this depends on the model
I pick up the same pad
I pick it up again
it may disappoint the
and everyone else
a 10.1 the Tab
no lags at all
I will give the Galaxy Tab
I hope you liked the video
come and this is my
Amazon fire
it is thinner with apron
but yeah not that great
the screen is fully laminated
gigabyte internal storage
and if you want to get it
simpler games like banana
I was able to read
Play Store you will notice
thanks for watching
Kobo tablet why do I need it
why is it important
that's compatible
which is most of them
well that's where the
Kobo tablet comes in
well actually
yeah on the back here
it's a treasure
recommend that and then if
it's very very simple
I think they have a tape
for the crypto steel
they were missed you know
where was it
oh it's right here
I'll do it on the next one
it should be
you really do need this
it is through the recovery
I don't know it is
that's exactly why
a bill fato crypto tag
backup for all of them
so you definitely need these
thanks for watching guys
look at that
stylus that fits in the silo
and it's it's robust
it's not going to get lost
it's a very good display
as a high resolution display
it feels pretty sturdy
I mean you really have to
it's even got backlighting
there's not much echo
a little bit weird
this is going to feel normal
Pogo pin connector
HDMI port USB 3.0 port
I have HDMI port as well
the nice modern
Kensington lock slot
the power button
it's very easy to press it
it would turn on
we have an 8 megapixel camera
II and designed
nits a brightness
even just shooting this video
skylake core em
that's a good part
we're just fine
there is the core
M 5 - 6 y 5 7
that's what we have in ours
Excel that sort of thing
it's been fast
surface pro 4 is no energizer
bunny neither is it a
x1 tablet well
now the nice part
Pro works just fine
control is fine there
it didn't mark up here at all
it's keeping up
I tend to draw pretty fast
it goes heavier now
let's say like that
it's decent
how you configure it
yeah that's always nice from
Lenovo full-size pen
what's up YouTube
it looks really nice in hand
7 inch screen
it doesn't look too
it doesn't look too small
so if you drop it
it doesn't feel flimsy
what's out there
you've got a hdmi port
which can stream full 1080p
it's a super vibrant screen
it's really nice and crisp
other tablets
it's very streamlined
that's touch sensitive
I'll really fix up this
this sort of beholder
iPad 2 size but seven inches
it's really crisp
it's very very good
so it's a blackberry
twitter at tech stops
catch you guys next time
hey 90 bucks
I figured one out
let's do it so
I'm down with it
4.1 jelly bean
okay sure 16 gigs
I'm with it
I'm winning perfect
it's got preloaded apps
how do you hold it you know
let's actually unbox this
it's got the booklet for sand
not too embarrassing
not so great
we have micro
SD card slot
we have our reset button
headphone jack
I don't expect much
what's on the screen
which means that
I definitely switched it
there's a letter following
I would say absolutely
this is a great deal
it gives you some sort of
I was correct
app stores updated to Google
that's just me
yeah pick it up
why not especially you know
I I want something with no
we'll play need that comfort
what's going on everybody
it also has that mi
this is very important
this hinge is very stiff
it uses a battery
it offers a great experience
that goes into the side
SSD the display on
if you're using
it is absolutely awful
it doesn't look good
I still want to mention
I think the tight cover on
both laptops are using
Docs maybe you're doing
I 5 in here
the x1 carbon
but with the x1 tablet
Amazon HD 10 tablet
it's got a nice weight to it
the screen is glass
it's nice and bright
it's got a mediatek
it does have stereo speakers
it supports wireless
you should be fine
Netflix and Amazon
so they give you some options
from a performance standpoint
it's running pretty nice
so that was great
the display looks fantastic
this one's good for a year
it's not all that invasive
Chris ala Greta
Tom Albrecht Brian Parker in
Cali an Kumar
yo what's up guys
okay guys one one extra thing
I'm guessing all cables all
it's the pin so you got a USB
it's rhett and test it
let me have a look
yeah it looks good
that's plastic not meat over
shut that over there so
crucial spear nibs
I think is four minus one
that's very quick math
cool it's ended better
you hold the camera focus
this is the to actual tablet
it's so thin it's really thin
put that over there battery
free pain tablet
we might need that
I was wanting a glove
that's fine okay so
the pen is really cooler
so that's quite nice
I'm pretty sure though
they called them sore
I'll try to plug it in
I think to plug it in
I had wrapping all around it
Hui on or anything like that
I think it's done
I ever fiddle with that latex
so I'm guessing ctrl Z or Z
there's two side buttons
this feels so weird
Claire's cool okay
that works fine
this is really lightly
let's do it way
I sat there for about
I'll be streaming on Twitch
two out of its box
you'll see that
it has a pretty appealing
look to it
I like the design
I had was the screen
the 7-inch screen fills up
which is what kids will use
large icons fill each screen
it is responsive quick
what's up guys averagetechguy
i've turned it on
this is the actual tablet
so this is the samsung galaxy
this is a lcd screen
right up here
it's fast it's fun
it's really easy to navigate
swiping is a breeze on here
looks really good
really clear really crisp
it's it's not lagging
which is a big plus
will this play those games
this tablet does pretty good
i have no issues out of that
another svelte boomerang
just make sure
Game of Thrones for example
we're willing to let it slide
for instance
that is indeed
still the z2 tablet 1200
and that's about it
you're doing underneath
it's the slower
and the ona
overlays out there
you'd expect from
which is about 5 megapixels
back background blur effect
when shooting close objects
that is a tad oversaturated
thanks for joining me today
Wacom medium version
it supports welcomes best pen
make a huge difference
but it's not for everyone
six is the welcome one
this is the
is that because the wacom
one is a display tablet
Express key remote

see you guys
was it worth it
let's take a look hello
let's get started
I have mixed feelings on it
what that means is
this is something that
that can be expanded
you have stereo speakers
it is a heavy-duty device
I can hop to a book quickly
I see with the Fire
what's happened some others
you can also download
on this tablet
we take it for granted
it feels clunky
YouTube app is a bummer
I just rather use my phone
I do need to recognize that
this device can take abuse
Netflix control
I think it's worth
thank you for watching this
have a great day bye
this is a
do you like to check out
this is very affordable
I have you know checked out
I think a you can see
feel very nice and tactile
you know typing on them
I'd like it to be
it feels a little bit cheap
you can see
I've noticed so that gives it
let's just be honest
it's very usable
just go to BBC
this is the 2gig
I didn't even see a man
I'm no good at it anymore
this little tablet
what's going on guys the
CTA pride back here again

srgb 5000k 6500k 7500k etc
and you can adjust the colors
ultra tablet here
it's not your average
Android tablet
its infancy here
I just have to say that
which is a lovely screen
it's fully laminated
I've actually seen in a while
you can see underneath
you have hidden away a micro
I'll just show you right here
it is powered by a Tegra 4
you have that on top
so their focus
so no need for that
they do like that so again
I'll look here at Google
well it's actually all right
it does okay
that caused this
it's not maybe the fastest
but it's still quite good
I get they
they are maximum performance
here out of the game so
of course okay
they do have a charger

in comparison to the size
I'm done with this review
the driver was easy

I had in my weird imagination

its opening in the book
basically it's good for you
we'll take a look at watch

let's gonna
it's doing a good job
for those times
imap4 you name it
it should work with as well
email accounts this
good for mirroring
kind of stuff
we can see why
My top critiques are
On a Wacom
Personally I don’t notice
Problem solved.
The tablet comes with a pen.
The power plug.
The stand.
And the manual.
Everybody else, carefully
Next take your combo cable
and you’re ready to go.
Turn your tablet on.
Under Stylus Pen
I didn’t see artists
Go to your desktop
Choose your tablet monitor.
In my case it’s 1.
Change the scale to 100%.
Go to Work Area.
Then your pen will work.
Other than that
The colors change a lot
The other screen tablet
I’ve used as of this video.
