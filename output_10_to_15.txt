today we have a quick review here of the dragon touch 10.1 inch android tablet
there's not a whole lot of you know customizing or options
because of that octa-core processor it is really fast it does
but this model doesn't have any sim cards slots built in so for the us
i just gotta click on the right spot there there we go go back
hit the home button and go launch another app like chrome inside chrome
you can kind of see how fast the internet loads on this
see if we have anything that pops open there get a little book
it said there we go and then we'll go to a different program
the um the back camera is i would say decent quality
it's a decent quality camera you know it's definitely nothing to write home about
we go and we can take a picture this way too
m106k pro gaomon has been a renowned developer in the chinese local market since 2011.
so we are going to start with unboxing so we have the tablet itself
m106k pro can be used on windows mac and android one of the reason
so you won't be needing a keyboard anymore when you're drawing or animating
let's look at the pen so the pen is very light
you can see a bunch of settings you can just set your hand pressure here
it doesn't have a problem for me to to draw and everything is smooth
it is the drawing that i made with a m106k pro by gomon
i was just like focused on my drawing and coloring and stuff
and i'll see you in the next one see ya you
obviously at this price point everything is plastic but I was quite quite surprised
but it's changed now which is very nice and the rest is alright as well
you can store music movies and so on on my grade
they're two cameras with a resolution of 5 and 2 megapixels
this is not a gaming tablet not because of the performance
it's alright for most games but the storage is with a gigabyte just very low
so you can't install that many games in Geekbench 3 in the single core test
Android 6.0 marshmallow has been out for why now but Samsung still ships
N word and that's pre-installed on it by when you get it
it's not that bad though because lollipop is still a good and stable operating system
Samsung did not pre install a lot of apps on the Galaxy
I don't like it but other features that we like that
I like in touch with like the multi window feature and that still included
they're only some from Gmail but it's really it so 9.5
it's kind of said that we want to get eight gigabytes
this is a quick review from these ten some Galaxy Tab 7.0
so you don't really need wires and then there's like volume very nice usually
obviously you want them to have and also if you have more than one tab
it comes with this camera in the back and this one upfront
they're not really good but this efficiently gets the job done
but this is where i need to give props to gaomon
it was a bit of a headache getting it to work
15.6 inch tablet with 18 92 and 81 92 pen pressure and hd ips
the plastic makes it come off as a bit cheap completely
i think for that you can also use the protective foil
it actually isn't difficult at all to use once you did set it up properly
ATS de volta Villa for hot hardware and this is Dells venue 838 48 inch
the tablet itself retails starting at a very competitive price of currently just 179 99
it may not be super premium in terms of build quality but the general design
on the top edge is where you'll find the headset jack
del does install pocket cloud and Dropbox apps for external cloud storage and collaboration
comm with the Dell Venue 8 38 48 inch Android Intel powered tablet
the tablet was here in this little plastic thing reasonable packaging some foam around it
but we've got power on and off volume up and down
that's the charging port and unfortunately it's only the old micro usb
it's not the usb type-c you've got a 3.5 millimeter headphone uh socket
i have to tell you you know you know it it
you know things aren't quite as rapid as they could be so
i'm not getting more much more than about five hours of screen on time
it's going to be stuck on android 9 with a july 19 security patch
probably just a little over 100 pounds because let's face it tablets
um it's got four keys that you can program to like quick keys or whatever
first thing is the drawing size its 6.5 inches by 4 inches
this is on par with like 70 to $100 tablets in that regard
it's on par with tablets that cost around seventy to a hundred bucks
so that's another really good thing about this tablet for the price
I'm just gonna do some simple designs just to show you the lines and stuff
so don't expect anything fancy but you will get to see how this works
you could just lightly scribble something and then you know anyway
the channel is the sketch monkey here and in today's video
I'm excited about this because it's not one of these expensive brands
that has a ton of marketing behind it and I want to emphasize that point
can he get a redesign done without any hiccups or problems
it might be mistaken for a tablet with a battery inside
it's simply a vein monitor that you can sketch on and it needs
you also have a scroll wheel for zooming in or out
I only use the front button and I use that as a right mouse
we have eight of them of course with the roller wheel
let's get sketching and see what this XP pan or is 15.6 pro can do
I'm used to as if the pen has more bounce in it
I use to control everything in Photoshop such as zoom pan rotate
I can see this set up being useful if you get used to it
the contracts is has good blacks and whites and the responsiveness is sharp
I'm happy the rest is just stuff I never use or care about
XP pen didn't interfere with my workflow and is the tool
done a good tool shouldn't bring too much attention to itself instead
I want without making a lot of noise about it if that makes sense
I say it did everything that I was expecting it to do
the bottom line here is if you're looking for a tablet a displace
it really means a lot to me if you enjoyed it
I upload it stuff like this I hope to see you in the next one
this is the latest one download extract the file and install
and above it currently does not support ios but uh the tablet supports
you can use it in your macbook but not on iphone at the moment
okay so you have to use it on your android phone
just look at the photoshop so it also supports in photoshop
you can scribble you can color or you can change it
you can use it to color you can use it to draw
i am i kind of like the the smoothing of it
so there you have it gaomon x620 which is really affordable uh in malaysia
the various links online on the e-commerce website like shopping malaysia
and all that because i think it cost you less than 180.
inches it is a 16 to 9 ratio so just standard widescreen
they're slightly less color rich but I hadn't really noticed too much of an issue
it's really not a big deal so it's really really nice
but it's a graphics tablet not a TV monitor or computer monitor
it's up to you to decide if it is for you but for me
I don't have any issue with with the quality of the screen
it does come with a screen protector on it in the package now
there's almost no reflection so that's great and I don't mind the paper feel
another good thing about this display is that it has a 5 millisecond response time
I have no problem I keep it at about 45 degrees
it hasn't for me because it's a really really really great displaced and
you just pull on it and adjust it and let go and you're done
that aren't who yawn but they they don't look great from other companies
so it's not going to fly it around on your table now
but you're really going to have to push to notice it when
I have no use for hot or for Express keys so it's fine now
the pen is kind of an important part of a pen display tablet
having extra pens nice even though they last 800 continuous hours on a charge
you can do that four hundred times before it runs out of juice supposedly
they do give you the cable to charge it in the package
USB charging cable so it's pretty convenient the Pens do have 2048 levels of sensitivity
it will sometimes give you a little go to this step
I don't know I haven't heard anybody else complain about that but sometimes it happens
I've noticed it might just be my the way I do my strokes
I haven't had any issues with it at all and the build quality is nice
I can't see how this isn't going to be a competitor
this one is definitely going to be worth worth giving a shot
so if you're not into this you might be into that not my thinks
I like the displays but you might want to check it out
it's baby no money whysa trial by him why she's trying
diamond fluffy kind of frightened pulled her legs slightly better tread lightly
yeah shining on my hair's just next shining on my head
I vanished walk about the crib with a Ice Cream Sandwich
I don't need a why your girl asked me how to hit
I didn't know my hair's just next shining on my hands
oh snap it was next up the triple sec stalking on my ex game
blow up on take top bunch of stuff on hundred shitty
better couple foreign ass rugs in my let bunny keep coming in
yeah coming from me clapping in the mid again folks yeah
I'm closing in the cat shining on my hands just shining shining on my hands
Then there's a stand we'll have to fix to the tablet
which makes it too big to travel with it or move it around
what makes it better for drawing since any light source could make it annoying otherwise.
it will take you no longer than a minute to do this now
I'll show you all of the connections needed for the proper work of the tablet
we'll be downloading the drivers from the official page and run the Installer
two years ago when started with the youtube channel some of you might remember when
I had drawing on big display if you can afford it
a size of minimum 13 inches is the best for a proper workflow
moto is matrix pad s20 and this is worth around 100 250 pound uk currency
it also takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone jack at the top here
it has two speakers as well so the sound quality is brilliant
i would say around six up to six hours of usage time
um operating system so you can download majority of the thing
now if you go on settings everything on this is exactly like an android tablet
you've got a security and location where you can use face unlock
okay so thank you for watching my video please do give a like and subscribe
so it's just a free item really swell cotton see functioning function
Salam alaikum SMO so I need review was I believe a fertilizer time
Pro with 4gb of RAM ting and 64 gig room HD
okay for everything on okay in a placement and in which
I bet but I get that so the vision would be missing pen
indeed had a pistol so Laguna placed on him to download stuff
he'll still Kira thinking of the one accused of a second source much but India
I see so funny like see that in this particular song
all right they see they put so far our food look at what
I had I could apparently I could have the the coded
go edition which is like a simplified version of Android operating system
which will allow you to get a hundred ditional 128 gigabytes of storage per
it's 1024 by 600 which matches what you would get on the the fire tablet
this tablet is not a speed demon so loading up apps you can see
I mean it could be better but it's for 65 bucks
it's not too bad another thing you might want to do on
doesn't have any issue with it but again it's not a game
they're not going to be sideways the way they are on most other devices
the other interesting thing is does not come with any bloatware which is wonderful
it doesn't do video like I said but you can see
I mean you can definitely get a photo out of it
that doesn't want to spend a lot compared to the fire tablet
you know hardware specs or similar to it as the fire tablet
have it be you know looking at a website or playing a game
you can get this for you know a few dollars more fifteen dollars more
you can get this tablet so if you want to pick it up
I'll link it down below if you have any questions or comments
today we're gonna be looking at a new tablet from the company
we previously reviewed their a1 and old version of the n1
but today we're gonna be looking at the new 2019 and one tablet
what's in the box and give you our top six features of this new
let's open the box and see what's inside okay so straight out the box
we have a USB charging cable and we have our USB charging plug
so that's absolutely fantastic to get a budget tablet with the latest operating system again
Amazon tablets that we've reviewed and had when you put it to sleep
and that is the pre-fitted screen protectors on all of their tablets
standalone tablet does not come with a keyboard not a detachable keyboard
Chromebook that's one of the things that makes this sort of tablet
you've got this little back button down here on most screens
so let's open a second one here and say open the New York Times website
and if you wanted to do split-screen you can do that
sometimes they'll just want to take up the whole screen now
we can flip back to full screen here pretty easily just by dragging it over
so that's a little bit of sort of multitasking split screen and I'll show you
I think some things that they might want to do here involve using that stylus
pull out the stylus and say we want to create a note
you use your fingers but it's a little bit easier with the pen it says
let's draw a teddy bear so Charlie sure I can draw a scorpion
I know I see circle or blueberry or lollipop more for crappy
tricky and overall performance can lag and the device can lock up now
it doesn't necessarily matter that this isn't as compact as it could be
but it's it's coming along and it's something that's that's worth keeping an eye on
not just the screen mode and I prefer a built-in keyboard husband for something
I usually prefer something a little bit smaller than nine point seven inches something
it's a little bit easier to hold in my hand and that's why
so that's the Chromebook Tab 10 this spradlin derp with little buting
the only tablet i really liked was actually my first tablet
you got the main screen with seven customizable buttons and a wheelie thing
it's maybe a bit big for me but keep in mind
i have really small hands so if you get it you should be fine
this is my article tablet compared to my other two tablets you can tell
unlike my huion does the driver is pretty easy to set up
i looked around trying to fix it but i just couldn't find much
i mean it's not perfect but it's good enough for me and keep in mind
amv it's a reader of one of the frames in it
it's one of the best amv's i've seen in a very long time overall
I really like about it is that it's actually got curio genius on it
if you've got a phone you can actually download the curio connect app
there's also a kiddo store all aimed at kids you know educational fun games
it also has child safe browsing this actually filters out over 32 billion web pages
we hope you enjoyed this video for more help and information go to curate
here and welcome back to another product review in this one
the bat huion was gracious enough to send this to me
let's just let's just get the pleasantries out of the way
which first you get a little little thank-you card which is pretty nice
I said this is gonna be mostly a talking head video
so if you don't care about the visuals and you just want to listen
this is a graphics tablet the difference between this a graphics tablet when
tablets are not like that you plug this in through USB
apparently there's two models there's the H for 20 and the 420 high blades it
I see where the 420 comes from four by two point twenty
every little microbe movement translates to a big movement on screen depending on your resolution
but it's probably gonna get in the way here and say oh
I would have no problem giving them this and saying here
make sure you use the subscribe sub scribe and hit the little
you'll find a link to this tablet so if you want to check it out
Twitch I'm gonna try to get back into doing live streams but anyway enough rambling
all right i got this new tablet and it is a wonderful size
um it's got a very nice high-end camera and it just it runs beautiful
um i'm just going to pop over here to youtube real quick
um i don't know what all we got going on here
um it did updates as soon as i signed on and started loading it up
just so how nice that is and it sounds sounds real
now this is a tablet that is designed to replace all your notebooks
so you can write on this tablet you can read pdfs
personally it does not feel like writing on paper there is friction
your palm won't interfere with the writing on the tablet so the whole writing
there are very few features but all of them are very useful
you can copy and paste little sections onto different notebooks and different pages
the undo and redo feature is of course really cool something that naturally
if you're writing in a notebook you wouldn't be able to do so
then another really cool thing is the convert to text feature
you can quickly convert text and send it to yourself via email now this
whoever i've shown this to so for example my sister she absolutely loves it
i wore out my first pen tip within about two to three months
that's not too bad but i just expected the pen tips to last longer
also do not give this device to kids they will f it up
because then you can just be done with it in the tablet
you don't have to carry around a bunch of different notebooks
share it with your friends and subscribe to my channel for weekly content
you can use it for drawing playing also and online teaching
we do the considerations watching the drawing process that i've made using vague establish
this tablet is my recommendation to people who want to start drawing digital art
nothing here has two external speakers it has a docking port
so let's just turn this on and you does use android 2.0
okay one complaint that we had and hopefully there will be a firmware update
it's really not as responsive as we will hope especially from a capacitive screen
so this is definitely something that we're very disappointed with as you can see
it's not as responsive as we want but let's go to the browser
which is our preferred browser of course anything better than stock browser
Europe is going to make your internet viewing a better experience for right
disillusion and how small this really is compared to to a 10-inch tablet
so as you can see there's not much real estate on here
the stock browser the pinch to zoom does not work on the stock browser
let me apologize for again the delay in the the Wi-Fi connection here
there is no pinch to zoom in here as you can see
now we do have problems with this 720 video you watch again
gigahertz am or 11 processor the image in the resolution which were significantly better
Android apps that the suite of Android apps obviously google android market
mind that if you will use the cruise market do not use
excuse to try to increase the number of so-called apps on their market
the back has a rubber-like material which prevents scratching and also to have a better
it's got a single back button below the screen uh smudge prone back
i just wanted to compare the page turns initially because the pocketbook
it's really slow to turn pages as you can see here
so i find it interesting that uh i mean the screens
look so completely different as you can see here so yeah
um so like this page is a little bit interesting like on the pocketbook
it doesn't have the best refresh so you have to kind of refresh it
when you're using onyx's you know customizable contrast or color saturation settings so yeah
i find it very interesting that how different these two screens look
even though they have the same screen so like i was saying with the onyx
i don't have any ghosting problems on the pocketbook so i got a lot more
so um that's one thing that pocketbook definitely has an advantage on
how these two devices with the same screen can perform so differently
another thing i notice is like a text balloons with the onyx
see how much darker the text is they have more of a contrast control
it just has a boldness option so when you go bold
front lights vary so much from one to the next though
someone told me that you can install a reading or a a viewer app
the puck book is like 90 cheaper than the onyx which is significant
this is a Smart Tab 2 in 1 tablet as you can see
here is the front of the box the top the side the other side
you got all the specifications for the tablet itself but this
here's your tab here just just just rip it like that as you can see
this is the front it does have a matte finish to it hasit material
I got the bottom of the tablet and of course if you open it up
the head jack micro USB DC slot with the reset button all this button
this basically just turns off your screen having it to go to sleep one thing
pad is that it cannot be clicked like a normal mouse pad
sometimes the mouse pointer will not land on that specific item
Amazon okay so the keyboard keys are a tad bit small
truly lags out the web browsing even using the touchscreen as well zooming into pages
this speaker does not work so only this one does playing videos on this advice
now let's test out both of the cameras and see how they compare
not really maybe if it was 20 to 25 dollars less
welcome to a new video on the geeky noise channel in today's video
i'm going to be sharing my opinion about this android tablet
it was sent in free of charge by the manufacturer for me to review
just give a little quick look at the box so really nice box and packaging
let me just unlock this again and put my uh passcode in
now it does come pre-installed as well with a screen protector
it's a matte finish on the back and the cameras aren't fantastic
i've been using it mainly for a little bit of social media browsing the internet
though it's a very very nice product really great great value for money
ark27 and d d v stata omega greetings from texas awesome
it's really good plenty of you tuning in so thank you for that
and i'll see you all again on camera on youtube very very soon
it is flexible so it won't break easily in my opinion
this is really nice tablet but you need to get used of it
and they haven't paid me any money or anything to give any positive reviews
sent me the tablet for me to give my honest opinion in this video
Yan and underneath that is the tablet itself and I was actually really impressed
it looks very stylish and very professional having the twelve buttons along
the build quality on both the pen and the tablet is super impressive
two five inch active area with 2048 levels of sensitivity it also has 12
the tablet comes with eight gigs of memory on a micro
I'm going to try and bring to the channel this year
because this tablet has been so fun to use so huge
I hope you're having an amazing day and I'll see you all soon you
I'm going to be doing a review and demo of the sim bans Picasso tab
Android multifunction tablet aimed primarily at beginners to digital art and students
it comes with both a pressure-sensitive pen and a case in the video
so thank you very much to them for that as always with my reviews
then there's the pen which is battery-operated and the box contains two batteries
the tablet itself is not as thin or as light as other tablets
just because the tablet was reflecting everything and in order to film
I had to come up with a solution for the video
so that's why there's a layer of plastic over the tablet
the tablet fits into the case really snugly and one of the things
everything is included in one box and I really liked that
to the case the setup for the tablet was really easy
I got a lot of really good line variation when I was using the pen
now part of the pressure levels can be adjusted within the drawing app so in
it glided across the screen very well and the only thing
I didn't like about the pen was the fact that it took batteries
the pen was especially compared to some of my other digital stylus pens
talk about the palm rejection not working very well for them
you're using and turn on the right settings it's the same with the pressure sensitivity
I found that sketching things on the tablet was really enjoyable
I noticed it more at the beginning but as I was working
I didn't find the lag to be bad at any point
I thought it was good when I placed the pen down on the screen
you may be noticing during the sketching phase of this drawing
this is because I'm using a very small brush and I'm zoomed out too far
when i zoom in further the lines are much better and smoother
I've also found the move ability of the tablet really useful
I don't have to sit at my desk all the time which is really nice
so that's about it for the review today to sum up
I think the tablet is good value for the price point
it's not going to have the resolution or the power than a much
more expensive tablet will have but as an entry level tablet
the pen was good and it comes with a case as well
that's paired with 4 gigs of ram and 64 gigs of internal storage
but we'll talk more about that later on in the video
we have a six thousand milliamp hour battery and on one charge
you can type easier if you're writing a long email or a paper for school
the back of the tablet is not gonna get damaged so for the price
i feel that this feels a bit um heavier in hand at the top here
we have a 8 megapixel camera so those cameras are definitely useful
so this is a recording done with a front facing camera on this tablet
they're not using a heavy launcher on top of that android 10.
the tablet also doesn't company installed a bunch of useless apps
how affordable this tablet is with that four gigs of ram
but everything that i've done with it does seem to work on pretty decent
the experience isn't going to be as good as a more expensive tablet
if you're using the five gigahertz wi-fi band you will get better
everything you get in the box for that money i feel that
not to mention this is much more powerful than the last fasting tablet
of course there are some more powerful tablets available on the market
thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one
you're gonna receive the charger and I believe this came with a stylus
I mean it's definitely all made of the plastic but this little crooked
I think the PCB is kind of hanging off inside of here
the keyboard does attach to the tablet with these little magnets here
up to 2.6 the GPU is the built-in Intel UHD 600 for gigabytes of lpddr4
33 megahertz this is non-user upgradeable and is soldered to the mainboard
it's definitely not the best screen in the world but for an $80 tablet
with this tablet another thing would be the 32 gigabytes of internal storage now
this keyboard should attach and it should work right out of the box
they use gloves but I don't think they're using them where they're assembling these
so it will be a bit slower than if it was running in
it's around eighteen hundred for the single core and three thousand for multi
so we're right on spot with the multi but single core is much lower
we have csgo 720p all low settings get an average of around fifteen
Li 720p although settings average 19 there was one game that performed quite well
but that's pretty much a given this thing runs on pretty much everything
we have some dreamcast using the re dream emulator this is
4000 CPUs PSP is another one that performs pretty decently on the in 4000
this has got a four chains of olympus a harder one to emulate
I mean it does work as a Windows 10 tablet you can check your email
so if you've been thinking about picking one of these up
but there's only so many screens and rooms to go around
oh it's so clean and then the best part of any new electronics
this is the matrix pad s20 not to be confused with the samsung s 20
I need to pick one up before my next road trip
that's supposed to make it easier on your eyes for late night
the camera loses fine detail and it makes things look like a beauty filter
if you're still using older microUSB cables ice to stream three to our movies on
Netflix back-to-back with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on when playing movies from the SD card
I got four to our movies with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off
there is occasional UI lag high-performance games and apps can struggle a bit
the camera juts out just enough about the width of a piece of paper
so I'm always afraid I'm scratching the lens when I set it down the home
those are becoming a vestigial feature on other products anyway so
like cases and screen protectors will be hard to come by
but if you're stuck indoors like me who needs a case anyway
this is the newbie and I'll see you later kids turtles
the major difference between these two is that the nova is using a glass screen
a truly glass screen not plastic like the ifly tech flush screen
embezzle this one's truly glass as you see on the right here
there are a fair amount of things in the way in fact
that's an indisputed fact that you can do more on this than this
but in terms of the overall look and appearance and everything
reading is a little bit different and looking at them with your eyes
adobe whatever the case may be you can put it on here
although both of these display manga beautifully they both do pinch and zoom they
so the glow lights cannot really be compared or saying one's better than the other
i mean anything else you want to do with these two can't really be compared
this doesn't have the capability of audio right out of the box without a dongle
you can't watch videos because you don't have any further video modes unlike the onyx
you actually do have three different modes you have speed mode a2 and normal
i don't care what the advertisement campaigns say about either of these two
whatever the case may be this looks a little bit better so weigh the options
check it out if you want to see individual reviews and comparisons on these
the first thing you'll notice is the large 8 inch IPS screen IPS
technology is better than LCD technology because it allows for better viewing angles
I really love the fact that it's a clean vanilla Android experience
it honestly feels like a pixel device with no bloatware unlike
I'm able to connect to the Panasonic image app such that
it's been very helpful and I really appreciate the larger 8 inch screen anyways
thanks for watching it and I'll see you in the next video
i'll check it out in my new series so stay tuned
that's coming soon now for those that do follow my channel
and that was unfortunate because i really loved that two-in-one check out that review
they're seeing this video for the first time just like you now
that's good and as i mentioned you get the keyboard cover
it has a really nice anti-fingerprint coating on it not too many smudges
that you do get you could also lay it flat as you see here now
the ports on the left side is a usbc 3.2 gen1 port and above
this is where i sit for my live streams and so forth
there's the back of the studio which is a total mess with boxes
i'm going to straighten it up so don't worry about it now
it did 1080p video so not bad for a two in one
plus where you have to pay extra for the keyboard and the pen
as far as performance is concerned this is running the core i5 1130 g7
it's soldered into the motherboard and my unit has a gigabyte ssd drive
considering it is a low-powered tiger lake processor worked really well
now i love the fact that the pen and the keyboard are included
it's got an eight megapixel rear facing camera and a front facing camera with five
don't forget to leave a comment in the comment section below
you might still find it awkward to use on your lap though and in general
I just throw it over a cross-leg to balance it out
what's a bit of an annoyance though is that lenovo's pin storage solution
we got 6 hours and 27 minutes in our streaming video test
this review was supposed to be at the launch of the tablet
i'm way behind but i have quite a few things to say here about it
and the tablet only comes with what it needs which to be
the button on the pen is actually quite frustrating to use
i think that i can push aside those relatively minor shortcomings
the pressure curve is quite nice and responds how i expect it to and overall
the surface just has a very satisfying smooth but slightly grainy natural feel to it
i still think it's a tablet that is worth buying if its strengths fit
xp pen always seems to be looking to improve their products
and i hope that they'll appreciate some of the feedback i've given here
it covers the same things that i'm going to talk about in this video
so let's do a very quick unboxing first the packaging box
the tablet itself is a wireless tablet so it needs to be powered by battery
so let me click this aside and show you the set arrays
there is one charging cable for the pen because the pen is also battery-powered
this is the 10 it has a nice weight to it
two buttons on the side it has a matte surface texture
there are eight replacement lips provided and this is the USB receiver
this is a bit small so be careful not to lose this
in order for the computer to be able to detect wireless tablet
it's a very comfortable working area for screen that is 20 inches
so here we can customize the pressure sensitivity of the pan
you can choose the dowel here on the right side here
and this is where you can customize the two side buttons
this is how you can map the working area of the tablet to your screen
you will not go to the right side this is other
the transition between a thin and thick lines is very soon suddenly
you can use the trackpad to zoom in and zoom out so it tracking here
and now let's do a quick pro's and con's recap so the major
Pro for me about this tablet would be the boot quality disk use first solid
the drawing functionality is very good to the strokes taper very smoothly circular spiral strokes
they asked move as well not angular and this applies to
I show you that you can pinch to zoom with photoshop
Pro quite well they work well but with MIDI Bank pinch
they are 9s they have a nice tactile feel to them and it worked
I prefer to turn off the functionality of the trackpad for me
Brad Linder with will repeating and this is an asus memo pad 8
it's got the same intel atom z3580 fastest chip on the market
but it's going to be good enough to give you a pretty good performance
tablet sells for about $1.99 makes it a little bit cheaper than a full price
Google Nexus 7 2013 edition or Amazon Kindle Fire HDX and in terms of benchmarks
it actually fares pretty well against those devices or at least the Nexus 7 which
and they're only on one sides if you're holding it in landscape mode
rotation you could make this the topic you really wanted to
Google Play Store and while early tablets with Intel Atom processor is
I feel like didn't do a great job of running every Android app
when you're not having issues connecting to the internet or something yep
you don't hear anything coming out of this side speakers reasonably loud so overall
let's go ahead and there is a custom keyboard application here
and then some studies on a laptop or even like someone who was a beginner
the bat is there is no left or right it's a left-handed and right-handed suitable
I sample with alt and I switch between the colours with X
I always had that this way so this is really great so far
you have of course the mapping you can map it in my case
my and/or the mapping because there's such little space but if
it's very small something you would take on the road probably from what
very lightweight doesn't take much space perfect for beginners or outdoors traveling
all are the other necessary accessories as you can see here
the fact that they had to provide two pens is amazing
we have here the greeting card a cleaning cloth to help
we have the cables to connect the tablet to your computer
eventually and here we have so many extra nibs and a key nib remover
the colors are way different from my laptop which is good
the screen has an anti-glare design which also can protect your eyes
i'm comparing its size to my ipad which is 11.2 inches
what i like about bix driver is that it's not separated per model
what big tablet you plug in it will detect which model you're using instantly
you can download the driver on their website at big.com and just install the driver
i always provide a speed paint process so in today's occasion
the fact that it only has two cables needed was beyond my relief
i also did a fingerprint test and it doesn't leave any behind
it gave me the feel that i was like literally drawing on paper
well you can take it on the go which is very convenient
and of course it's battery free so no need to charge the pen
and it's very affordable too if you're looking for a cheap display tablet who knows
well i bid you guys good luck and stay safe everyone bye you
you has made some very nice touches with this particular tablet however
this is open enough to come any and it does come with a micro
put it in there and then you can cover it up which is like
I said actually a nice thing because it prevents accidents accidental popping out
you notice how it's grayed out that's inherent to all IPS displays now
I just have the kids at Kids Place which is a very safe environment
so that's a huge selling point in my eyes and of course
although very well fit on a child does have a enormous amount of flexibility
you just turned that button on that button is only for the FM transmitter
these are definitely not what you expect with the kids headphones
I would expect really high thin anemic middle range and like no bass at all
a lot of great touches with context shows kids tablets and headphones
now this is a very low end tablet it features android
i think for this but overall it's a very cheap tablet
you know viewing experience for this sort of price point at least so overall yeah
Android drawing tablet that was sent to me recently by the company sim bents
I was told is that it supports pressure sensitivity and part rejection with included stallers
so that got me interested to review this tablet but before
let's check out the things that are included in the Box
there is not much printed on it not even the specifications
the tablet is prized at us $200 and it includes this carrying case
the tablet has a one-year warranty and here in this small box
this will go to the wall charger and this site here this
this stylus pen is also included and the build quality of this pen is excellent
here there is no eraser at the back of the pen
I'm not sure about the battery life but it's supposed to last quite long
I haven't used the pen enough to drain out all the battery
I'm not sure where you can buy replacement tips when this one wears out anyway
you get this pen you get the case you get tablet
there's price range especially when they included all the freebies as you can see
and it's a bit heavy a bit thicker or behaviour compared to other
they are quite close together so sometimes when I'm pressing the power button
I mean accidentally press the volume button speaker on this side
a small microphone port and this is the micro SD card slot
I'm going to do a search on my review so let's type in sim bans
I can also sort of show you how fast the Internet is loading
this tablet uses a quad-core 1.3 gigahertz processor overall performance is quite snappy quite responsive
this is not a very high resolution screen for a 10-inch screen like this
you can customize a lot of things about the OS so I installed Nova Launcher
let me show you some strokes on sketchbook app first so
this is something that you have to get used to so these are slow
wahwah drawing this lines and I had some stray strokes here so palm rejection
so this sort of prevents those straight strokes from happening enough of the testing
so let's try and draw a quick sketch using this pen and have it
you can use finger gestures if you draw at this speed that
I can raise my palm on this side here drawing performance
let me just scroll slowly to let you see the lines
sometimes there are jitter but sometimes there aren't any so for lines like this
there are some slight cheater but overall still looks quite smooth
for some reason the strokes in up flow they are a bit smoother
compared to sketchbook pressure sensitivity is supported here as well but again palm rejection
it doesn't work too well but I'm glad that the strokes here
sometimes it depends on the app that you use there is still some slack
oh let's do a quick sketch again because palm rejection doesn't work very well
so if you look at this sketch that i drew at normal speed
this is quite responsive you can definitely take notes with this dollars
I think captured quite accurately although not at 100% accuracy but for Android tablets
there is slight cheater but not too bad compared to other apps
I can get around 8 to 10 hours on a hundred percent charge
you can use it to watch youtube videos but the song isn't that great
we've limited budget for students for beginners who want to try our digital sketching
I am more than satisfied when drawing with this pen and tablet the 10.1
the resolution is a bit low for this 10-inch screen if it has a 100
Jeeter but some apps they are they perform better so again
hello everyone it's Apple mint and welcome back again to my channel as always
so if you're into art videos please consider subscribing so for today's video
Julian always includes these little thank-you cards so this is the best part
so this is the tablet stand so it opens up like this actually
you don't have to worry about having this gigantic stand with you
you can just slip this into your backpack with your tablet and you're good
so yeah these these are really they really come in handy
this is the pen case and the pen is actually a lot nicer right
or you can purchase this it is 483 dollars and let me tell you
it is a really good tablet for what you pay for
it is amazing so you know this is honestly my new
because if you're looking at a Wacom Cintiq which is 13 inches
that's another plus and just the overall portability of this tablet is really nice
I I'm gonna say it's not you know it's not perfect you know
I'm not really feeling at a loss here so I would definitely recommend this tablet
I would definitely definitely say to take a look at this tablet
I've always wanted a nice tablet screen tablet and I just kind of love
I'm really in love with this tablet and I'm so so happy and grateful again
there's a link in my description on exactly where you can get this tablet
i'm going to be reviewing the gammon m10k 2018 drawing tablet
i don't know why it just took me so long to flip over a box
i'm going to flip it over again and let's see what's in the box
um i don't know why i didn't think that it was a case
so those are the nibs and that silver thin tape them out
that's not the right way you put it in but okay
everybody does then the warranty card then how to download the driver all right
the pros are that it's smooth and i really like all of it
the only con i have is that there was a strain recorder
good there you are my name is Alex and welcome to a new review
we also have four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of internal storage dual band
the box is the brand name and the model name inside the box
the device itself so even though this is not that big
then you can basically hold it in your pocket if you want
1 F 1 if I remember correctly this one is actually made out of plastic
and lastly on the back we have the port for the power adapter
alright so first of all these loops just like any other mini
I notice that I didn't like that much was the screen resolution
this is the RAM so we have available two point two gigs of ram
at this time this is the harddrive yes so we have a Samsung Quran
that we've seen on our other mini pcs with the exact same configuration
this is the hard drive so we have some type of a Samsung storage
and you can probably tell it stops it goes again it stops
it goes against all not a better experience for watching YouTube videos
just you have a better idea how code use the form for live strings
so let's keep on this again and we'll just wait a second
I'm not even sure if we should try the other file
look if it's going to be the same all done all of them
I totally enjoyed this video if you did like it press that like button
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
satisfying shot and with the drawing tablet comes a little drawing glove
the left side of the tablet has eight customizable shortcut keys
there's a little red dial that you can either use to scroll or zoom
I've never done this type of video, so I don't know how to start ok
So ... I'll show you what it brings, I guess first
the first thing we see is the huge tablet, I can't believe it
It has ten shotcut buttons, man, TEN, WHAT TABLET GIVES YOU TEN BUTTONS
beautiful felt case, does not use batteries and does not have to be recharged
that is very good, because it is somewhat annoying, the pencil also has two configurable
Look at her, how beautiful (inclusive language, Hispanic thing, info. in desc) also later,
nope, it didn't die, it's only in ... (how to make an interesting protagonist?
the meme is a backstory, but not a character, it is a fact
I hope I can show if I do the pilot ...
I don't know, make theories, I don't know, you are for that >:^
ok, you saw how everything works, it is beautiful <3 now
that's less than half of what it costs about 10 seconds of wefere
you'll be spending most of your time touching the beautiful 7 inch
Amazon they don't have a place to buy music on the device
I'll be doing a review and demonstration of the Galman pv 1 161 pen display
the tablet taking a look at what comes in the box
then setup the tablet test out the pen and create a finished artwork in Photoshop
so the tablet comes really well packaged in a sturdy box
everything is well protected and set into a molded packaging insert
Express keys down one side and then power menu and adjustment buttons along the edge
there is a full list of specs over on the Galman website
I liked here that the cables were all connected as it keeps everything tidier
issues they have all the drivers for their products available for both
the driver took less than a minute and so did the installation once installed
I could fiddle and adjust any of the settings to the tablet
I was ready to start drawing for the drawing portion of this video
I'm starting out drawing lines and swirls varying the amount of pressure
how much pressure to apply to get the line that you want
the pen itself is actually a bit shorter and slimmer than the other
I've reviewed in the past is the lack of battery or charging cable
I have had more issues with lag when I was working on an older computer
but that was the computers issue and not the tablets one thing
I did find however was that the tablet heated up as I was working
I normally do as my other tablet is much heavier and thicker
it's also important that you have the updated driver software as well one thing
I want to mention here is that the tablet doesn't come with a stand
Galman for sending me along this new model to have a look at
thank you all for watching and have a creative day you
today i'm going to review my first ever powerblock graphics tablet
and this part you see extends from the right top corner
it is usb type-c my favorite and also it looks super sturdy
and there are two usb adapters for the android mode one type
and i will record a video about that with the solution
it's good and finally i will change the nib and yes
if you have any questions please comment below and let me know
its internal storage comes in two sizes ranging from 8 gigabytes to 16 gigabytes
by inserting a micro SD card up to a maximum of 256 gigabytes
is that it already comes pre-installed with Amazon's personal assistance Alexa
the camera for sleep does let it down and should really only be used
the screen itself does look fairly crisp however it easily and I do mean easily
if anything should go wrong with it or in case you lose it so what
hello everyone and welcome to the second installment of the seer
today i will be reviewing a graphic drawing tablet specifically the goemon
i'll start things off with some basic facts about the tablet
the other four are used to adjust the display settings of the tablet
there are even pictures to show you how to do it
you then pull this latch on the back to adjust the stand up and down
the next thing to do is get it connected to your computer
it's time to download the driver which you can find on the goemon website
there are 10 shortcuts which you can format using the fairly intuitive button
in my opinion the pressure sensitivity worked fine and the shortcuts also worked well
there isn't much else to say about it except it draw good now
please enjoy this footage of me drawing some stuff on the tablet
despite the excess use of packaging tape that had been applied to it
for one of those screen covers that are super satisfying to peel off
and yeah what it's supposed to be is a textured screen
but if you get the tablet you'll have to deal with the software
I do because you can't set different shortcut inputs for specific software
connect the tablet to a power source and connect the tablet to your computer
and if you want to use the stand you've got to put in four screws
it's not a bad thing that this tablet isn't portable or convenient
I'm not saying it isn't a reliable tablet or that it doesn't function well
most importantly about the tablet is that it's functional and reliable
I hope you found this review helpful and anyway thanks bye
and i like how the eraser is as pen pressure to it
the screen does sometimes show imprints of my drawings and they are easily wiped off
i'm not really a fan of the whole pen sleeve thing
it doesn't feel intuitive or natural to me it's just not ergonomic at all
it's quite rare but when it does happen it's very annoying
look up references or even to watch shows whilst i draw well
if i'm not drawing i can have both monitors on especially when i'm playing d
i tried using the keyboard at first a lot of my keyboard shortcuts
instead was i got a numpad i messed around with this
software called hidden macros but the software didn't work at all
you know the camera will be moving in each frame separately
and it'll just look awful so here i just bring them in
so i put them to like ctrl c ctrl v ctrl z
and so on um also the pen has quite a nice grip
you're not going to do that because you have this really neat glove
you know um but it was really cool that it came with the tablet
yeah here's some footage of me just initial doodle of technical blade
it arrived really quickly and it is very accessible for newbie beginners
you know if you don't know where to start i'll see you guys next time
if you can chip in anything i would be very grateful
you know and there's different perks and search for different levels
you can see this video on the side go watch that
Tab 750 this is a 10.1 inch tablet from Samsung and to unlock
this tablet can take a SIM card to provide 3G functionality
it is very subtle and it's nice and as you can see
and if you click on the same it quickly takes a snapshot of the screen
let's say this is an open pane over here let's say
I just click here and I drag it and the shortcut goes over there
I want to talk about is the actual screen quality of this tablet
that you get now moving to the web browser you get the standard web browser
this is the standard web browser that you get with the tablet
I'm gonna click on the same and one thing I am really impressed about
just click on this pane and it just switches so it switches pretty easily
no problems with that also as this is an Android tablet it will support
what do you say flash without any issues so just let me
you get the optimized version for the tablets for the market and
also let me just quickly go back again to the truth of web browser again
go back to the home and let me show you the
it's a small quibble but I just wanna let you know about the same also
and this area is the notification pane for the honeycomb tablets
and hopefully i'm going to see you in my next video you
the dragon touch max 10 android tablet now in this video
display is housed by a small black bezel that runs around the side
it features a webcam on the front for your video calling and on the top
you will spot the 5 megapixel camera with an integrated flash next to this
you will find the icons for each one telling you what they do
and there is a small reset button located just below the volume down
this tablet is running the android pi vision 9 operating system
i've added one or two more but it still leaves me plenty of space
so don't worry if you don't have one there is one with it
i will put a link to this in the description of this video
if you've liked what you've seen please do consider hitting that subscribe button
if you'd like to support the channel please do check out our patreon page
that's it thank you for watching and i will release another video again soon
PC it's also called a called excite sometimes or it was at least last year
this is one of the slimmest tablets in the world with seven point seven millimeters
we will show you what's pre-installed and as you can see already here we have
I think for you and let's choose 720p but of course
Oh Google will find us but I don't care much then
said we have here a nice little email theme you already know that from
I will just compose a new one can type for example Julien
let's go to English and then we can write even long words like McDonald's
it's kind of hard for me to write upside down but at least
I missed that but it still knows what I wanted to write
let's see if breaking works actually as a husband if you already did
McDonald's tell the other company so we have borer and no
I think we have a 30 day trial here and then you can
of course see you can do a different things here and make it bold
maybe or things bold that you write you can actually make it even bigger
this is a simple editing tool of course we have the same thing for
Excel which is pretty nice and then we have the same thing for presentations
I think you should be able to select can I select the words
Toshiba 8200 which actually I forgot to show you with the iPad
also where you can charge your device and maybe do something else
it doesn't really compare to an iPad and one other thing I forgot to show
you could rock it up and down and you can hear it there
and you can see that little micro SD card in there
it took twice as long to get it to fix him and micro-hdmi
I'd say I'm not sure exactly what it goes up to put to my eyes
6 inch screen it is adequate you know when you get up to ultra resolution
well looks great and and that so there's nothing really wrong there
it does feel like a developed platform and actually the only reason
five six pounds you know it does feel a tiny bit clunky but it certainly
but that's pretty much it the a couple of points one
the original touch cover was not as good as this it it
I'm a pretty awful typer but the the actual it is it is pretty good
and you know if you're looking now let's say use models and that
there still is not anything better out there really like a lot of the new
Atom stuff is like I've had the Dell Venue Pro Venue 8 Pro
I haven't had the the new 10 Pro and it was pretty
this is a polished product the office the productivity and all that honor is
my package is here today, oh hey there it is thanks
Disc, a little helpful booklet, a screwdriver to help us build!
there was another box and then inside that box there was a pen
What? They also sent me this glove which keeps me friction free
You're gonna notice how big they're this is my hand on it and
Okay, first of all just a friendly tip if you're upgrading tablets
And then it lasts for three days and with two pens
Have a smudge guard glove, and I really like the glove
hey i'm ryan from technically well and i'm checking out the taj
atoll t 10 plus tablet at the time of this review
come with an octa-core processor but this one does and thanks to these eight cores
switching between applications was also very fluid with only an occasional hesitation
this is the e X Pro x1 7 inch Android tablet
I'll have the link in the description below and this is an entry level tablet
it's a 7 inch tablet which is kind of an odd size
but they did a few things to mention on this tablet
this is only Amazon for 38 bucks it runs KitKat 4.4.2 so it's super stable
so let's plus this guy open show you what's going on
they do a pink and they send me the pink one
they giving a little bit of literature here and they give you a charge cable
this guy has the lower end specs but also is the lower end price too
USB you've got a microphone you've got a rear facing camera a back firing speaker
you're not gonna have to worry about that if you want to check out
YouTube it again will take a couple seconds to load up
Beyond and we'll play it back and I'll show you guys again
this is me obviously not the greatest quality but you know
Google now built into it so you can ask it questions
you know deal with a little bit of wash out there
if you can deal with that if you can deal with no
Windows 10 and it retails for 240 dollars starting off with the design
inches with the 1280 by 800 display which is sufficient for media consumption
you can call it and it's pretty useful when you're using this in tablet mode
and if you don't then you can always flip it underneath
this tablet is also packed with an 8,000 milliamp hour battery
I missed in the description as well as any diss count codes
we'd have to find an adapter which is pretty challenging the headphone jack over here
Lib which is a customized version of an application download refer the device
it is not the fastest thing as you can see here
half the time it seems to crash the device try to use it
Arcos used to be great about offering updates for the device itself
they're done see me any updates since this first came out about
Oh two months ago or so and I believe they're outsourced or Android development so
we suggest that you stay within relatively close range of your Wi-Fi access point
Android menu button here so you press the little software menu button
that's up here to get your controls and here is the Android keyboard
because it's not capacitive it's not multi-touch display likewise with the keyboard
you really can't type with two fingers and do input because of that
it will fast forward to a more interesting point of it movie
they're pretty fairly pretty good quality and you can scroll through like that again
though it's much faster on a motorola droid than it is on this
can we got ours from expanses USA as a review unit
visit our website to read the full review of the Archos 7
I'm gonna do another drawing and let you guys know what I think
just be able to make room for the 24 inch tablet
we go this is during this there he is he was really cute
oh whoa there's no feet on this one but this one
let's see let's see what kind of accessories we have here
of course we've got pen in the nibs and for instructions
the car both colorable mascot model so I guess you can
but you're gonna have to fight your daughter for that yeah
there's a lot more drawing space on the 16 inch unit
lock-in is and it's a light unit and it's a really good local unit
you can zoom in and out very nice because you can you know
I did hook up to our gaming laptop whereas the XP pen 24 inch
I think would fit comfortably into a laptop bag but I just love
you don't even need the stand you can just take the the tablet itself
alright guys so here are my final thoughts on the innovator display 16
it's great it's actually a lot of fun to draw on
it's feels very much like drawing on paper or drawing on an iPad
inches the whole unit is about the size of a 17 inch laptop
it's thinner than the stylus that came with the 24 inch
XP now currently this unit is retailing for only 499 dollars
and if you want to join our community go to clownfish talk com
hello tile artists its talent here of course and we are back again today
tell her have you tried a human before should I get he won
he won this he won that and I was like whoa
I never tried a Hugh on tablet before you guys so I can't help you
I don't really need like an exacto knife or anything to open this
I thought this was the original box but I guess it's this one
I don't even know to be honest so it turns out
sorry if there's like random water spots it's because I just took a shower okay
oh my god oh thank you for choosing huion huh what
I know has a not enough button is the Cintiq 13 HD
whatever so there are about eight there are eight control keys
it's really light when there's a lock in and unlock and wonder what's that for
I'm just gonna put the size of the tablet on the screen
moving on there's the DVD instructions ticketing agent against it hmm hmm
I just exaggerated that so much but seriously I love this okay
so here's how the pen holder looks says huion on it
I did use my laptop on this so just let you guys know
you don't need a huge heavy hardcore computer to make this work
just a basic laptop will do just fine though yes anyway
better like you know in my painful size so I was like whoa Nelly
oh yes so if you guys want to check it out
you don't even need like the huge chunky piece to attach to it
just to make your wireless cuz it's already wireless to begin with anyway before
I don't really have any other words for it to be honest
yeah it's just like it just has everything you could ever want
because there's this and this wrong with you you know what
I mean there's nothing really wrong with it to be honest
so yeah if you guys are really confused as to what to get
that's the only way you can really judge and see if it's good
hi guys and welcome to another unboxing video if you remember my last unboxing video
we are doing the same today except it is a newer model
you have a pouch for your tablet a little pouch for your pen a glove
they just give you all these nice little extras and it's just
let's set it up with my laptop and check it out here
it is all set up and i actually found out it
there just really helps me out and helps me keep creating content
so it'd be great if you could check it out other than that
and this is an android tablet and it's a big one
the power switch and a three and a half millimeter headphone jack
i think this is just so big so what i want to do
its responsiveness i don't know if that's pretty typical of android
the screen on this little bad boy is amazing so it is one huge
i think 10 inches here but it is just incredible in fact
so it's a nice clean unmolested version so i don't really have to learn anything
i think it's going to be really really simple for you now
the last thing i want to talk about here is the overall experience
this thing is phenomenal and i would think at this price point
i'll put a link to it in the description below peter
a lot of that is my camera but yeah as you can see
also this guide to all of their other tablets came as well
I presume they are the same tablet sold under a different name in different areas
we can see all of the specs and they're looking pretty good
I'm impressed that this has USB C is host powered the viewing angle
let's get on to the unboxing looking forward to this one
nothing really fancy here but the case is nice and sturdy
it's gonna last you while you're carrying around that pen now
now let's get to the setup we can see straight away
how handy that one cable is no string of cables and the multitude of cables
nice and quickly for me there so I was really happy with the setup
the colors straight away on setup were nice and accurate the one thing
it was dealing cross-hatching absolutely perfectly on curved lines the line distance stayed equal as
you know there was some difference in variation but barely any
it was pretty good if you look at the tests here on screen
I spent about an hour and a half on this draw test
that one at the beginning of the video was about 10-12 minutes this one
the initial sketch for this was five minutes by the time
I can't say the tablet felt wonderful but the pen does feel good
I do think this is a great drawing tablet especially for the money
I spent a couple of days tinkering with the color calibration now to me
don't be put off by the fact that my video is a bit greenish
you can see at this point that the illustration has actually come on quite well
you know it gives you a variety of ways to work
if you're a student that means you could take this to university
I have to lean across my own hands to press hotkeys
this isn't so much of an issue it just means that
I don't end up using the hotkeys so much now for filming
it's okay because it means that my hand doesn't get in the way when
I do it if I was using the tablet without filming it
I did wonder if I put the wrong drivers in but yeah again
I just pre transformed the picture so he wasn't as destroyed and that looks
I know a lot of us more comfortable with a 16 inch row
they may only have the room in the studio for a 16 inch
I would want something a bit higher resolution like a 4k
and that's all that matters at the end of the day
I ought to think that the tablet is the reason for the lack
I still only have Photoshop open or Corel Painter open whatever app I'm using
I think but it would be more time consuming and as a professional illustrator
it's just about tidying up those other things that they could bring in
let me know if you like this would you think of the illustration that
what do you think of stylus or do you think that balling one cable
you could attach this to a laptop take it out on the go
and then you know you've got kind of an all-in-one right there with two monitors
you save money instead of buying a surface book or something
give me a tweet let me know and I shall speak to you very shortly
I can't wait to see what you think of this until next time
yeah okay so absolutely cool actually see you soon have a great there
I'm Dominic and I just wanted to make a video about the huion tablet
the customer service is not very good because you got to contact them through
and there's not really a number to call so to me
if you're going to get a tablet it might seem like a good deal
this is a character that a friend of mine wanted me to design for him
so if the more expensive tablets or anything like they're cheaper tablets definitely go with
I don't even use it anymore every time I try to use it
Wacom so in my opinion for someone who's owned the Wacom tablet since 20
some one whose own I mean a Huey on tablet since 2013
there started drawing and i find the screen very pleasant to work with
it was smooth to work with and i just love it in general okay
however is that there is no tablet holder to put the tablet on goldmine
i really didn't like the fact that it involves a lot of connectors
i want to say that i have been using a wacom
and so i guess i will open them from the smallest to the biggest
one the tablet is so tiny and compact great for traveling
let's open this first okay so similar to the first one
uh we've got a adorable printed line play characters on there
and i've watched a few reviews on xp tablet display things
so we got our guide another cute pencil pouch another glove some more
okay so yeah we've got our nibs in here which is actually quite nice
yes oh ooh i like the the silicone-y feel of it
so first we're going to start out with the smallest one the star g640
uh you can't tell that there's even an image there it's completely flush
and so given its size and it's really affordable price point
but i would say that you might as well upgrade to a larger size
it's a bit more on the shallow side in terms of the angle
i put it on because i actually had just put hand lotion on
so that was a really nice thing to have but overall
i don't think that i will really need to use the glove
most of the time and then here i just switched over to the screen
i'm just kind of fiddling around with it as you guys already know
some areas were super smooth and then some were a touch gritty
i don't know if maybe that was the nib or the angle
you don't have to worry about charging the drawing tablet or the pen
i found that i didn't feel like it was getting really really hot
because it's definitely going to be something that is an investment and so for me
so let's get this thing open and actually before we open out
I thought I'd do a quick run-through on the technical specs here
I don't know if you guys can see that's probably not on the camera
so this goes to the power adapter according to the sticker
there's also it looks like uh it was at mini DisplayPort
maybe we'll see one of those fancy two finger gloves which
okay let's get all this stuff out of the way okay
I did run the calibration software and that seemed to work
Mac I am so while I'm flatting this since this requires very little brain power
the number is there's there's definitely this is only a 1080p screen
I put it side-by-side with my macbook my Mac books have pretty good color representation
I'll try to figure that out too but the like on this device
I actually kind of looked at both and I think I've got pictures of both
I'm looking for like I think if you put this just on its own
I'll get to the pros and cons at the end for sure
there are a few of both but for the price you know
I thought it was and I was looking at this before
I kind of expected to be let down by this like a lot
I expected to find a lot of problems I really did and I'm just
I mean I'll go down my so pros and cons here real quick pros
it's extremely comfortable like it's got this sort of soft touch
it's really not so yeah three pros like I said the price I mean
I'm coming from but once I got going with it I really didn't notice it
I calibrate it it is because I calibrate it from my eye
there's actually two films when you when you open this thing up
you tear off the first one that just protects and shipping
I guess at some point there was a driver issue with that
which means it's a quarter of the pixels that are in 4k
it's going to be obvious that this is a 1080p display
you know maybe that color gamut comes into effect a little bit
I just I really didn't see much of it like I said the eyeball test
really you know didn't make much of a difference for what
I don't have to return it but I wasn't paid for the review
any of that kind of stuff that they wanted an honest review
but it's a rugged sort of coating regardless that resists scratches nicely the t100
pretty impressive screen sharing in general and multitasking with Windows 8 1 in the benchmarks
we've reviewed xp pen and now we're going to be reviewing article
the first thing you can see is the warranty card for the warranty policy
then that pamphlet where it tells you to download the driver
while right below the tablet you can see a bunch of things
one is a micro usb and one is a usbc then unpackaging
it has eight keys and a dial and below the tablet
okay guys so i'm about to test it on this phone right here
so i'm just testing this with my backup phone my old phone
i'm not sure why it's not working with my other phone though
it's just my issue but yeah it works perfectly fine before anything else
actually but it's kind of a waste of a shortcut key though
i don't really mind since i don't really use shortcut keys
that much testing it out in paint tool sai and the pressure sensitivity is working
that inspired me to use live cd and she is an amazing gadget
i really recommend this tablet for beginners intermediate artists or even hobbyists
if you're interested in getting this i will leave all the details in the description
box below magic and that is all for the m0610 pro review from artisan
if you guys enjoyed the video be sure to leave a like comment
ding ding for more videos for more reviews probably anyways siege out love
the we geeks podcast which you can find over at we geeks podcast.com
ring thing on the side the wireless capabilities are just the beauty of this tablet
Wacom sits on my desk everyday not sure how I'm still alive
first we've got the pen and pencil or the pencil and paper
if the results don't really need to be really really great
I'm going to give it a 7 now for the Wacom
feels really good but doesn't really come near real real pencil and paper though so
I was proved right because as I mentioned before this child of all things
let me know how your tablet has changed your work or maybe if you think
Wacom tablet and why I would love to hear from you about this
I would love to hear from you below that's it for this one
and today i will unbox and review the human inspiroi inc h320m
okay now let's open the box now and here is a little
okay now here is the cable for plugging the drawing tablet to your device
also a wiper cloth to clean those spots and smudges on the tablet
it prevents your hands from putting those prints and spots on the tablet
don't go into your android device plugging the cable to your computer
i will have a link in the description if you want to check it out
sony says it's the world's thinnest and lightest waterproof tablet but isn't worth the price
you would think that would get in the way but it actually doesn't
you can pop a fingernail in there to open it up
I think has it beat but in terms of color reproduction
and that's because of Sony's triluminos screen technology in terms of performance
Sony is obviously one of the biggest names in media and entertainment out there
and that's that that's not just because of my face now
it goes for about a hundred and forty five bucks on Amazon
I really wish they'd put USB see now this tablet runs Android 9
I said any angle which is always an awesome thing with a tablet
I played a game of this game already and it runs it fairly well
and it's not amazing but you would think you know for 145 bucks
you know issue with any of that you can see while
the speakers are awful on this to be honest with you
I don't even know if you can tell but they sound awful
the speakers that the screen is very you know especially for the price
so you do have a headphone jack right here and I'll you know
they sound tinny they sound low they don't they don't have good volume
you have at the top here the micro USB charging port
you have the two stereo speakers which sound awful and on the back
Meg's download 36 upload and this was just know five minutes ago or so
I'm running it on the tablet right now but on my note 10
so we'll see what kind of score we get on the tablet
so it's good that you can plug in a pair of headphones
but again you can add more via the microSD security and location
unlock so just keep that in mind but it does that face and lock
you can see you can press power volume up to turn it
I checked a few days ago when there was not again
you can do some gaming on here as well web browsing looks decent
and you know you can do that stuff if you want if you need to
you can open at up and open up tabs and stuff
so don't think you're gonna be available to you're gonna be like a multitasking
this is of the wacom intuos4 bluetooth wireless pen and tablet for this video
kind of my overall thoughts and any downsides of the product
if you do run into any issues you can be away comes of website
I was able to connect to my 27 inch imac relatively easily
I didn't get any skips or inaccuracies when using Photoshop or anything like that
it gets that deeper deeper markings on the actual Photoshop as you can see
you know no way but you can do anything you really want and adjust it
and now let's go on to the finals section my thoughts on product itself
all right guys kind of going over the overall summary of what
10 tablet is really just a nitpick has nothing to do with performance
I got closer to with usage with my normal everyday usage
instead that's from shutting it off turning it on cetera et cetera
if it's left on constantly it will drain your battery past
it's safe zone and what it will render your battery essentially useless
shut it off whenever you're not using it and you're good
you should be good to go other than that fantastic products
i wish they would put the factory screen protector on at the factory
i i doubt i'll put it on here if i keep this
i may be ebay this product by the way i did buy this
um this is a not not a spent to product review
okay we have a couple screen protector accessories to get the screen on
we do have a sheet of paper from a google play
uh that's how to get the google play store on here
the books devices are as you'll hear me a lot of times they're great devices
i i consider this the engineers device because it's more of a left brain device
where like the remarkable 2 is more of a minimalistic or the super note
let's go ahead and open it up and take a look
so let's see i just want to see what the cover is
i don't know if that comes with it from amazon or not
so let's go ahead and open it up as you can see the box here
i did get some complaints on the ghosting from a couple of my subscribers
here it comes out of the the case and again another screen protector
i just think it's just a pain for some of us to put on
it comes in a nice kind of a plastic books nova series piece of paper
i don't want to ruin this because i may be putting this on ebay okay
so here's the device um it looks pretty good the colors
so we'll see i'm going to power it on in a minute
it's pretty small but big and i don't have big hands
okay all right so let's look at what we got in here
i would assume yes it is usbc and then we have the most important thing
um and that's where we're going to go so let me charge it up
uh this is just kind of a cheapy thing for 400 device
um again it's pressure as you put more pressure down it comes
because as you can see i'm on eraser no wonder duh user error
um there's red you can kind of see red right and if i go
see that's what everybody's saying is that the ghosting's a little bit of an issue
so if you come over here and refresh the screen again
there's black let's go ahead and go with a you know red color
i don't even know what wt means so i haven't gotten the instructions again
my reviews are just right off the cuff straight out of the box again
i purchased this as far as black and white looks great
okay let's go into actually uh some of the seeing some of the stuff now
one of the things i do like is the web browser on
it is pretty cool so i went and grabbed a video
let's refresh it's an advertisement on my video but you can see the ghosting
okay here i am talking so you can kind of see
this device isn't meant for video but you can see there is
and let's refresh this and we'll take a look at a webpage
so a lot of people want it for comics and i
but it's not anything spectacular like game changing and here's some books ideas
you can see a little bit of the color on some of these apps
it's kind of cool and you can kind of see some of the apps here
is it the the big game changer that i thought it would be
it's just do you want to spend the extra money on this device
2.5 i think they just need to keep working on it
it's it's fast and again when i take that and put that on now
nothing great all right so i just wanted to do this
something i would use probably not would i use it as a reader
i'm gonna try it but i think the ghosting's gonna drive me absolutely crazy
i might use it for some comment comics but even then
i'd stay with my kobo because it's just easier so again
i don't know i'm gonna give it and i bought it
and if you've got some comments down below if you're saying hey jb no
so if i'm trying to read something in color it's going to be hard
this is an Android 3.1 honeycomb tablets 10.1 inches and this
I don't like that and it's also much more precise than even using a capacitive
when avos ad at home back a web browser launcher under rotation lock button here
we have a little door that drops down some things recover the doors
except for your power button volume controls are over here and on the bottom
for some reason it covers the full-size USB port with USB host
that we're going to show you in a bit that sells for $100
this is a quick launcher and because there's so much software on here
you can configure what you want each of these to do
but you can choose to assign gallery to that or something else
obviously your email and web browser in the middle we've got
to businesses not end-users primarily security is an important thing in remote management virus protection
say if you've got movies or something like that so that's good
they say you should turn the display off if you wanted to charge
the three point to a little bit of a bummer there
look if you want to sideload books lenovo likes card games
so we've got a bunch of card games pre-loaded over here hearts solitaire
spades euchre and mention em spot videos load if you want to rent videos
uh their prices tend me a little bit higher than average
slacker is pre-installed their social touch social networking which is basic social networking
because you've got this really big screen here so we've got Netflix loaded
the display is brighter on the ThinkPad version as it should be since it's IPS
also has much wider viewing angles and in terms of thickness they're both pretty thick
Lenovo is a little bit bigger overall and obviously in terms of thickness because Galaxy
suite comes with documents to go and this can view edit and create office documents
and you get a very basic interface at first with keyboard deployed
but it definitely gets the job done and it's fairly compatible speaking of editing documents
Lenovo's to make knows how to make keyboards really really good keyboard
we've gotten it slid into the mountain and you can see here
you've got your your laptop substitute to go on the road again
you've got a dedicated number over here and a bunch of Android functions
this still one of the lenovo because this is one sturdy laptop like guy once
that could make a larger keyboard and welcome both side by side now now
this is not horrible but once in a while it will it happens
60 online packs multi thread tests and about 32 on the single thread test
this one will let you do it but the frame rates are not so good
we've complained some about the software the excessive amount of software
and there's a sketchbook pro that supports pressure sensitivity with this tablet
but did you just say that one color and you can see it
works very fluidly no skipping nothing like you see with capacitive styli
PDFs there's not too much beyond notes mobile but not small
but we're just going to write something in cursive and he actually got that right
which is average among android 10.1 inch honeycomb tablets and it's 30 250 milliamp battery
that's sealed inside the unit perfectly capable playing game since it's your standard
even if lenovo's not thinking about gaming you can whenever you got some downtime
so that's the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet running Android with a 10.1 inch IPS
I'm sure they're gonna receive the same hardware refresh as well this device
you can pick it up for 120 regular price not on sale
really you know that the bilk want to show you the back of this thing
I mean any device with a reset button is one that I just
don't know if you can see it but it's not centered properly
this is a reset button on the side of this device
you can have it behind a cabinet and you know it's just
before on a cheapo device either textures are off for the game fails to load
that's because some of the instructions that you need are not included with those cheapo
you can actually run 3d games now on even the cheapest full-size hardware like that
you find in a laptop or like a mini desktop computer
it sports a 2 2 megapixel cameras and they're of questionable quality
it says on the box that because the word mobile Excel mobile
if you can like and get it right you can see underneath the jeez
I just picked up a Black Friday sale on a Dell laptop
I know they're coming up pretty soon especially but thanks again for watching my channel
this is hack the planet have a great rest of your day
let's see what i broke all right so this is the stand
actually this one looks smaller so and this one actually fits
you got your pen your brand new pen which looks exactly like the previous huion
you also got your little donut holder your little poke ball
i can fit two and a third of my cintiq's 13 in it
i'm probably just too used to my 13 inch screen that
the screen also has less cursor offset than other tablets which is worth mentioning
there's no house light reflecting in it while you try to walk
it has buttons on the side and no eraser so keep that in
it doesn't wobble around at all but also isn't too stiff very sturdy
this is excellent and definitely one of my favorite things about it
a lot of tablet stands tend to wiggle on lower angles
let's go turns out walking with a glove on isn't really my cup of coffee
i'm sure there's a way to recalibrate these beautiful colors once you lower the brightness
i just didn't want to mess around with the settings too much at this stage
unlike the canvas pro 16 this special graph is very adjustable which is nice
you can play around with the pressure level to your liking
i'm basic so i don't mess around with it too much in conclusion
i think it's good if i'll get used to its size
i may as well keep it as my main tablet who knows
this tablet comes with a one-year warranty by the way if you are using any
we have a big piece of microfiber cleaning cloth and one artist glove
horizontally or vertically the remover built into the back of the stand
the cable actually goes here and as you can see this tablet
I have also tested the tablet on Mac OS with driver version
we can assign shortcuts to to set buttons on the pen
the pressure curve can be adjusted manually by moving this dot
I have only assigned two so to switch between all these functions
I just put no action and now let's talk about growing performance
I can maintain consistent pressure very easily so the thickness for the lines
Photoshop a Mac is a lot more responsive compared to Photoshop on Windows
I'm only talking about it because I saw this on the box
where there is this lack where it's less than responsive anyway
Pro works perfectly on Windows and Mac OS but less than ideal with Android
these are always a more affordable option than the more fancy screen option
fortunately though this tablet saved the day and works just perfectly on catalina
so if you are a mac user you don't have to worry about that
it's become my main drawing tablet ever since i got it
i love buttons on my tablet whether they're screened or non-screen
i've used has had that though so if that's something you're really interested in
so if you like put anything sharp on it or leave heavy things on it
uh keep in sort of like checking in on your pen every month or so
this tablet is kind of my dream tablet in a lot of ways
the stand is really important because with a tablet that's relatively large
um it also comes with a protective little case for your pen
i find and also the battery is going to make it a lot heavier
which if you're drawing for hours and hours on end that's really not ideal
there were a lot of bonus goodies like these little stickers
juliana davis ume lilly john moscat snow white schmeichel hidden squid
now he's a 10-inch tablet as you can see at the bottom
okay and that can be it can go up to 128 gig
millimeters Jack Poe and it has a USB type-c charge impossible at the back
there as you can see and at the front he has a two megapixel camera
okay but for tablet doesn't really need a lion or very good quality tablet cameras
and it's at the front as you can see this bit here
it's designed with sleek metallic edge and imposed a mere patent in his book
as you can see at the back okay got that qualities
I'm software between Wi-Fi only doesn't totally take em a member a SIM card
you will have only the kids mode and Mickey controller the way you want it
ears friends i am proud to announce that finally after so long
the instruction booklet as well as a microfiber cloth which i actually appreciate because cleaning
but that's not a bad thing necessarily the stand itself as usual
i never actually had any issue with the tablet stand from before
the tablet itself is as i said a 15.6 inch drawing space
if your tablet's positioned on the left side of you rather than the right side
the screen quality in the visuals is actually a step up from my last model
this is a small step up from my previous xp pen
is that my tablet for some reason will seem to lag in csp at random
the innovator display 16 is currently valued at 500 on the official xp pen store
oh and the art of the background is of mumiji from touhou
recently if you want to go read that there's a link in the description anyway
which is about standard for every single youtuber on the site so bye
I think it's kind of unfair when you're paying $50 more for it
was really glitchy just crash and spaz on you thank you
which means you get a full 1280 by 800 pixels on display
just as you would with a 10-inch tablet from a looks perspective
it's kind of macho and reddish because well it is a
just nice pretty curves but if you look at the back uh-huh you know
so let's take a look at the specs of the zai board this runs
Android OS 3.2 honeycomb expected one good upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich motorola
this is aggressively given the relatively small casing and the smaller battery inside
that's one of the big differences between this and those iboard 10.1
so you're obviously gonna get longer run times with the bigger xiphoid 10.1
it's a double either 16 or 32 gig storage capacities through isn't a micro
we'll take a look at our file manager here and see what we see
so you can see how it plays high profile 1080p content plays perfectly
you're just going to scale down but it does have that micro
five five five five on on two two and SunSpider a very good result 1807
that's this not quite as fast as a board 10.1 but again you know
Zhai board and the other important difference is the active digitizer
it does absolutely nothing here because this does not have anything beyond the capacitive digitizer
and not the 8.2 software bundles also a little bit different
which isn't here now something like the Citrix client you can download using the moto
you can view photos all that kind of stuff and you can just grab files
seems to be pretty inescapable these days but also very popular
it's pretty popular cloud notes syncing application and sketches for the drawing part
bundle in this since it doesn't actually have the active digitizer for pen use
iOS devices might be familiar with digit because they make a similar application that controls
TV provider satellite over-the-air that kind of stuff and you can also set location
I'll pop it out to fullscreen 480p like most of all Android tablets as I
Talk video chat among other things and a 5 megapixel rear camera
10.1 does have better stronger reception though more room for an antenna
Verizon it's Motorola second generation honeycomb tablet will get Ice Cream Sandwich at some point
I didn't know just no I didn't exactly play my cards right cards
come in please thank you help me my Asian Santa and like he
Oh [ __ ] I didn't order anything Santa not Amazon Prime
you freaking idiot if Miami asked you know what it is
it actually has a pretty sweet rubber grip and I'm pretty glossy finish that combined
what a fine tip is actually kind of kind of pretty heavy and godsend
I've set my bottom is saved and my up is transform as usual
I can use this feature to write funny harmless little messages
I was pretty on it in early 2019 as you can see from here
a lot of people say that my art is good except that
so you can't really expect much from this you can see the build
he's a seven inch tablet and it does have a rear camera
um it squeaks a lot here it takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone jack
i've skipped the registration i went directly to the main menu
i'm going to show you some apps that's already in pre-built in for kids now
um spin guess learning animals so it does have a few
you only have to download a few games etc learning gaps
this is one of the most inexpensive drawing tablets you can find
which are the primary issues with this little tablet for the value
the look and design gets a four out of five as well
and it's an entry level tablet from a few years ago
I got it for Christmas when I was 15 years old
and the fact there's two ports for you to plug in your tablet
the touch wheel is honestly a game changer and I miss it on every tablet
it's a pretty small tablet and it has the same little fabric
but it's those things that really stick with you when you use something a lot
the design is really cute and I quite like the new buttons
it's super light and you can get as comfortable as you want with it
Cintiq Pro and the first thing that I noticed is that is very light now
because yeah it's a lot of cords one of the big things
the bottom of this weighted pen holder is made out of metal and
I really really like having stuff like that things that are not all plastic II
it's definitely a 5 out of 5 on the value scale
this is a very very interesting tablet so there are screen tablets
I believe to purchase but now because only refurbished models are available
and lastly it's pretty heavy to look around based on its original price
this one was originally going to be a much earlier entry
it was sent to me when my channel was first really getting started unfortunately
may be covering some loopholes and talking about some things about the next book
I feel like I didn't answer in the first video now
it comes with a front facing and a rear facing camera the front facing camera
I cannot remember I believe I said in my first video
but they had said that you know the tablet is great
well you know that man let me let me say before
but the back on the device is sort of thin and also this device
and sometimes it can get almost as hot as an easy-bake oven sometimes so
all budget tabs are all tablets rather also another little pet peeve with this and
I do not know if it will do it or not
it is a third-party keyboard and also it would result back to the stock keyboard
I would say for $99 you are really getting a lot for your money
so it has that option to update the software on this tablet
you're getting a really great tablet far as budget tablets and I can't I can
if you don't mind could you please rate my video and fellas
they were given to them as a christmas present by us
um i've been wanting to do it for quite some time
because i think the game still had quite a lot to them
i suppose more of a more of a big kid tablet
um i didn't want to get the kids ipads because ipads are crazy expensive
and i i just feel like for a kid's tablet a kid's first tablet
i recommend you keep an eye out for things like black
how old are they um and then added in the family sort of wi-fi password
kids tablet is this access to kids plus amazon kids plus so amazon kids
plus you get free access to for one year with the purchase of the tablet
so this is one of the things that i really really love about
basically it's safe so there is a web browse option but only approved websites
i am the grown-up and this is all linked to my prime account
i'm not limited in the way that the kids app is so
there's the adult element there so say you do have a child
she doesn't have my pin number and she's never getting it
she can't get that so all so her sort of whole thing
the only thing she can access is the stuff on this kids
they don't have to do anything they don't have to purchase
that's one year free access to the kids plus app from amazon thereafter
if you have amazon prime it's one pound 99 a month per child
the thing that they've played with before they can browse through apps and games
we have actually found that that does fill up quite quickly
um account on the tablet so you can't just put it in and it works
now i know that anyway because i don't let them take the tablet to bed
uh downstairs i don't let them have it in the evening
i've got one child's device there their user data one device there
so i know without looking at the device what they've been doing
say an hour a day so say you're feeling like well
i'm happy for them to read whatever they want whenever they want
so those are my thoughts on the amazon fire hd 8 kids edition
I was at the mall with some friends today and I was at Best
Wireless torture to gear by internal memory expandable microSD slot which is also very good
because we know we're gonna fill up 32 gigs pretty quickly camera
there is no tape for this this time he's gonna go ahead and just
I think this is the way they want you to open it there
we go and of course we have get these out of here
we're just going to go ahead and just sit this aside
there's one more piece in there but we'll get to that in a moment
you're not much to see you know you got your charging ports here
I'm gonna bring back the box because we know we have more take this up
I think there's more yeah we got more stuff man they really put these boxes
it looks pretty sleek and I can see where it connects to the laptop
I'm kind of feeling this I mean for for $80 for $80
I just believe this just kind of goes in like that
of course you can't see it here but isn't right on par with something
Windows OS the tablet also comes off the keyboard and plugs back in easily
the keyboard is smaller which can make it harder to type on
update is ready for your new tablet which is great too
there's just one big problem upon trying to install the update
you will need a lot more space than you already have on your tablet
I know being a bit picky about the lack of any real storage here
unless of course you're in the games like candy crush not that
Like and subscribe if you did until next time this is your old pal
i got a charger a 5 volt charger uniform and a mini
now let's see this device has a place for your earphones
a microphone for mini USB cable place and a micro SD card holder
the volume up/down button and back button so let's unlock this 9 there
we go so this is the home screen of a tablet
what I found with this device was when I use the net
one and it's canon tablet is specifically the b3 a 40 model
and if you're holding it like that you do cover it up which
I don't like having a lot having the things like that
I do quite like because it's textured plastic so it's good is good to hold
where you switch into it like that but once you're in games it's okay
it connects to both two and a half or two point four and five gigahertz
Wi-Fi so you get good speed out of it so for its price
I really like it so I've been meaning to do a review of it actually
this one has the upgraded 9 20 by 1200 resolution screen so
this was updated right after it got released so now we got lollipop on here
gotcha is a little bit different than other operating systems on android OS
if you just double tap on the screen it'll turn it back on
as a matter of fact you can turn on and off dynamic contrast
I think was the volume level or kicking in so if I would kick
even at full volume they updated this like a month ago
you can just cast the screen to larger device if you have the appropriate hardware
remember somebody asking about apps you can save apps to your microSD card
you can actually set it as the default location if you want to
install the iPhone a text-to-speech because it sounds better than the Google text-to-speech
there's this weird high contrasting um makes the text kind of darker
it does show fingerprints a little bit more than probably some other screens
so as far as performance everything seems to run quite smooth with this tablet
HD movies play wells go ahead and load up this HD movie
I think that one came pre-loaded I certainly didn't load it
where's that the real so this game doesn't play plays without a hitch
I mean I don't know it does the job but it's not that great
I mean the iPads that I used to have the iPad air in
its camera definitely was clearer than this ones camera is so one thing
I kind of like the two column PDF layout on the Google Play
you're going to notice with a tablet like this with the 1610 ratio screen is
it's going to cut off to scale the PDF is going to cut off
I mean you don't have any sort of hang-ups or anything like that
you do have an occasional you know slow down here and there
everything's nice and zippy so comics the layout really nicely in portrait view
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this video right here
thank you guys for watching and you guys have a good day
ROI back again back to with a review of my new Acer Iconia 1:8 tablet
but everything's getting back to normal now and everything's working so now
I can go ahead and continue with my normal filming schedule what I have here
it once again is the Acer Iconia 1:8 tablet that I purchased at Best
this is just something that I purchased at Dollar Tree and it really works
I can go ahead and use the tablet maybe watch some Netflix
Netflix basically do all the basic same things that I like to do
1 gigabyte of RAM now this is where I thought it was gonna struggle
but as you will see it really works well in this light
HD screen resolution is perfectly fine once again for what I need now
I would highly recommend getting something that has a little bit higher resolution
the cameras on here are really not not good for anything than your most
I believe is just telling you how to set up your Google account
the rest of the information is built into the tablet itself
this is just basically telling you if you have any questions just contact
I'm going to go ahead and clear because I've read most of these already
of course it's gonna have to play in ads first but here we go
it's just using the one CPU because we're basically only running CPU Z
if I scroll over here you can see some of the different information here
DPI that's the screen density total of 970 megabytes of memory
it does use quite a bit of that so even just
which is actually very good considering the this is a cheaper end laptop and like
I would highly recommend getting something like this because for the 60 70 dollars
I like it on the top here you have your headphone jack
right there and right here is your SD or in this case micro SD card
I'll go ahead and pop that out real quick and show you guys
PNY card so nothing super fancy but that means with the built-in 16 gigabytes
here you can see you have the 5 megapixel camera right on top once again
it's a limited time offer for only six months from the launch of this video
coupon code is helium to 20 and is valid until the end of
I'm gonna say through the process of receiving and then setting up the device
the pen came charged enough to use from the beginning but also
Bose over 800 hours of continuous use and to be honest
I know it's a limited period of time but I do feel like within
in the option for the button functions on the pen which
US dollars the question is does that price pay for the performance and functionality
thanks so much for watching ladies and gentleman and until next time
make sure to subscribe to my channel for new content every week
I mean it's okay like I said I still think it's a little overpriced
it came with some pre-loaded stuff so I'll just turn it on here
I got this for you know a 20 month old so I'm not looking to
I'm not looking for anything fancy I do like she discovered this
I mean we have a TV but for road trips and stuff
it's not like your fancy phones or like for a 20 month all okay
this entertained here for a good 15 minutes so not bad you know
this is all pre-loaded on it and then the games see some art
I mean she doesn't really follow along with it but you know that's okay
what's another one just lay out kind of see educational games games
that just wants to woo you know and of course she plays more like this
I think are pretty much you have to maybe pay for
you know a lot of people were kind of knocking it and stuff and
oh yes it does that it glitches a little bit but you know
it just depends on what you're using it for this for my you know
I'm gonna go ahead and oh yeah there's some like little stories and stuff
this is the vulgar prior pad x 100 10.1 inch android tablet
there is a front camera and a rear camera will get into that
now before i show you the actual tablet on and working
and we'll swipe and it'll wake up and here's everything you need now like
do you want to go ahead and restore that i said yes
you know this will run anything you can get from the google play store
i've been playing this game for many years now and have achieved many different levels
you can see playing a game like this quality is there
it does everything you need it to and that would be it
it has all of the options that you might expect from an android device
that's the main thing i have no problem using this as a day-to-day tablet
it feels solid and sturdy all around really a nice unit
the resolution of this picture is 1600 by 1200 netting approximately 2 megapixels
the resolution of this picture is 3264 by 2448 netting approximately 8 megapixels
but that will make the front and rear cameras effectively 1 megapixel
which in my opinion is the correct aspect ratio for photographs
here is a video from the front camera recorded at the maximum resolution
i'm now recording a video using the front-facing camera on the vulgar 10.1
this big is not something that you're going to really be recording video with
tablets are one of those things that a lot of people have them now
make sure you click like make sure you click subscribe and take care
reporting for the best bi can at a plugin blog and this time
plastic and as long as your child isn't a thrower it should protect the tablet
quite well so this thing really has a whole lot going for it
Disney's froze and it's on there and this fun little Spider Man story
which is exactly what we'd expect a carnival-style shooting gallery but the one that
Leo bond saying thanks everyone for watching and have an ex one day
Melling back here and I have a review today for Rey
a lot of surface area for drawing and also included is this
I feel like I have to keep pushing down super-hardened like you have to
I want to make more videos where I'm drawing it stuff so anyway
it really means a lot to me when you guys do that
what's up guys naresh here welcoming you back into another video and in today's video
this android tablet is only available in black color but matrix pad z series
connect your tablet with wi-fi connect your tablet with wi-fi and it supports 2.4
it only took me a couple of minutes to configure this tablet completely
if you set it up you can use it on your tablet calculator
google chrome clock drive duo all the google application and a file option in here
i am in the end of this video and now let me share with you
this video shall see you soon into another one bye for now
I reviewed the huion GT 220 V 2 tablet but today
I guess you could say that in this video you could probably look forward to
I'm going to divide this video into sort of three chunks
I'll sort of go through some of the specs with you in this video
I'm excited to see what they have in store for us with the 221 product
but at least it looks cool and we unsheath the box
okay so this is the the actual box for the device not the postage box
we have with a third box without general cables a few screws
I have never bought a tablet device that came with a smudge guard
Pro comes with the stuff you need for a stand and much like the 220
last time it took me about 10 minutes to set up the stand
I don't want to wreck the screen but I do have to flip it
so that's probably the real reason they give you free pens now
they're easy for you to download for Mac or PC download extract install
all in all it was a really fluid experience actually surprisingly powerful considering
time specifically a 14 millisecond response time which for a digital tablet
that you're drawing on is pretty nice now as you can see
there are a total of 10 press keys and touch bars
some people love these and some people preferred the keyboard on the lab
I tend to be a bit of a keyboard on that kinda guy
the specifications rattled off what matters most at the end of the day
so that's my feedback to hear on the other minor problem
but obviously that's a little bit of a shortcoming of the device that being said
I have a spare and even more affordable with that five percent discount
the first that was actually quite noticeable to me is the build strength
I guess to best summarize how I feel about a device like this
you see behind me in the space of two hours with this device
I mentioned before about the lack of the double-click and the slight funniness
the very bottom left corner not actually in where you would do any creative work
I always recommend people to use a smudge guard when they use a display tablet
Pro today was delightful and I can definitely recommend it to you
I want to thank you so much for watching and of course make sure to
thank you so much for watching ladies and gentleman and until next time
Jazza that's it for now and until next time I'll see you later
so here's the device itself that i it comes with a screen protector
i must say it took me a while to get used to this new experience
i must say this is a very great competitor to our the wacom intuos tablets
um if you don't have a proper computer that is equipped enough to handle
it boosts the algorithm and remember to leave a comment just comment down
and what do you enjoy drawing and ask them to subscribe
there are not a lot of accessories included just the essential ones
you cannot assign control option and shift to the physical shortcut buttons so
I'm going to close this again so you can also assign the soft keys here
the tablet is going to map on 200% of the morning
the transition between a thin and thick lines is very smooth
let me zoom down to 100% so this are how the lines look
they are very smooth and a deeper white gradually the overall performance on
and they say that these may work with cs6 or newer versions
so just at post cs5 it works on and off not just that when
the strokes the taper very nicely as well very responsive very smooth
it's pixelated because i zoom in quite close but pressure works without any problem here
you can let me know in the comment section below overall
greetings everyone the Eric here and welcome back to another product review in this video
we're gonna be looking at the artis you'll be 13s before we begin
also if you would like to kind of help keep it supporting me
also check down in the description where you can find where you can pick up
alright so the audio for this footage actually gotten that stuff so
I'm gonna have to do the voice over you can see here
you have a bunch of information that you can read off
that has little adapter so that you can plug this thing into the wall
I'll show you how this gets set up in a little bit
next up we have the obligatory container that has the glove now
we'll do a ruler test all that kind of stuff and while
Express keys a completely battery free pen that comes with two
I did the obligatory ruler test from what you can see
while drawing slow diagonal lines definitely one of the cleanest displays
I think depends on if they have it up in the Amazon store
if you haven't to stay up to date with all my stuff
I am Yuri you know we've got our Christmas catalog out now yes I know
there are a few things in the box for you to go through
you also get five double-sided coloring in pencils and a black tracing pen
I won't be using it today or just if I don't really need it
there's three different brightnesses and all you do is just here in
it is turn your light pad on place that down where it might be easy
so washi tape is that it just removes really easily with no residue
I do them from scratch but there is a way to do it
it comes with a few copies of this piece of paper
point of your star so very easy to do with the light
your lines geometric shapes purp you know petals and things like that
I then got a compass so we had used to have them at school
if anyone's done any of my drawing lessons you know all about circles dots
well okay look so pretty so you can make this oh sorry
or you can turn it off and continue to do that on your own
I believe which is a little bit less than the apple with the Retina display
it's got a nice home button here hooking up to the Wi-Fi was very easy
you can kill stuff with it but it's really good on this particular tablet also
I also have some word Vista you can actually click on make you type quicker
I'll show you how it sounds right here you can see the sound
it's a squirrel that I rescued and fast in the air
also and it's very quick and responsive you can see here
let me turn on the camera as you can see it here
I've got a USB charger also or you could plug it into the wall
here for a mini SD card you can have up to 64 gigabytes
I think it's a great investment especially with screen resolution responsiveness and the Asus brand
you'll get this pen tablet with a big hello from brown coney and sally
what's left in the box are the micro usb cable and some paperworks
now we're using the next tablet in the line collection the deco 0-1 version 2.
this one has an expansive work area measuring 10 inches by 6.25 inches
this one's only eight millimeters and also includes its own translucent protective film
this line of friends edition is compatible with windows pcs macs chromebooks and android devices
adorable time to put it to the test time to color
i think the size of the deco 1 is this sweet spot for pen tablets
dial is one of the best features in a drawing tablet out there
drawing on an artist 12th row feels like drawing on paper
microfiber cloth usb extension with power adapter and adapters for different countries
stand it's so cutie pie look now time to put it to the test
now i'll add my favorite part adding what harris calls as the worms
the problem with that is it just couldn't compete with an actual pen display
xp pen gave me one of each tablet to give away
i'm giving away three never-before-opened tablets to three of you guys
include a brief description of your artwork and your instagram handle
so if you want me to share your artwork just post it on instagram
I'm sure a lot of you guys know that I'm religiously working on my book
Nima and so maybe I can paint a piece from the book with you guys.
So usually I give a tablet away at the end of the video
Stick till the very end of the videos to learn how you can win.
My favorite part is always the removal of this plastic film.
especially when you have a beautiful product like this, it doesn't really correlate.
As long as this works and performs beautifully then I can forgive this.
for: is that it requires one cable to hook up to your computer!
Course Series, this is Faye's master and I love the quality of it!
I'm sure if you guys are watching this you are deciding
which new tablet you want to buy, is this one the right one for you?
Is this better than the Cintiq or vice versa, you don't know.
So the 22R can be directly compared to the Cintiq 22
For the most part they are basically the same, you know, they both have 16.7
(8,192), has the same exact screen size (21.5"), same exact resolution (1920x1080)
this tablet is the price point and it retails for $699!
That's insane! $699 compared to the Cintiq 22 which is $1199.
Wacom's level, you know, this pen does not require batteries or any power to use.
I'm just kinda gonna drop it in and see what we can come up
I was thinking, kind of like, maybe like a purpley cloud that's kind of cool.
Now it feels kind of like, like a bright midnight in a way --
You can keep trying new things until you find the mood
But I think no video is complete without some color dodge!
Will I use this on a daily basis for all my work, all my paintings?
Best thing is its affordability, it is significantly cheaper than its competition.
Now the moment we've all been waiting for.. The giveaway! Aah!
The YouTube one will happen today and then the Twitter, Instagram will happen next week.
Rule number one: follow XP-Pen on Instagram and Twitter, rule number
Rob here and with me is lenovo flex 3:11 inch tablet slash notebook
you're going to see it for less during this holiday season
I was speaking to you in the end of November of 2015
there's no reason on earth that a laptop in 2015 or probably 2016
I'm going to get a touchscreen and I'm going to get a two gig
make sure that you have the laptop set to be able to flip the screen
otherwise it's going to look kinda silly with screen upside-down but here you can see
so you can basically in tablet mode the keyboards facing down
you should of course immediately do that before you even touch the thing
Windows 10 so upgrade yourself to Windows 10 if you get one of these
I talking about I was going to talk about construction then
it's not too heavy but it doesn't feel cheap and light
if you look at the screen it's impossible not to notice that gigantic bezel
it actually puts off the look of the of the entire device a little bit
I do like the screen when I'm looking right at it
the keyboard if you look at it it is a very flat keyboard weight
that said you know what after a few minutes of typing on
I do like the fact that they bothered to put like a chrome edge around
I did mention earlier that it was a 500 gig hard drive
it is absolutely not an SSD the cheaper model does have an SSD in it
it right away it also comes with an amazing amount of circus
I don't think I would be planning to do that anytime soon
I've had absolutely no lock ups with it it doesn't get excessively warm
I'm stressing it so that's really nice and it's very quiet
well let's go over the ports on this side if you look right here
there is a third on the other side making it totally acceptable
Ethernet port you need you notice they can can talk to you alright
here and right here is a button that locks the screen position
I thought they claimed ten hours on it but I in actual use
I think it has enough ports it has three USB ports on it
it's not going to be a gaming machine by any stretch of the imagination
but you know you can play a little bit on it again
I think you'll enjoy this laptop quite a bit all right
and this is the mic for visual aids for the video video calling
these are the volume black keys and is the reset key
this is it can be used to by inserting a small pin on it
that is the 1gb almost when he builds point and 8gb the large internal storage
it won't be anything hard for them to start up with the device
it's not a pretty by device but we like the iniquity option of 3g
they're not the thinnest tablets in the world both coming in at roughly 9 millimeters
but it's certainly more than passable with great colors viewing angles and brightness so
the camera around back of both of these tablets is extremely basic
it's a 5 megapixel fixed-focus shooter and no LED flash like most tablet cameras
but it's a nice secondary option if you really need it
Lenovo's camera UI is just as basic in bare-bones as the camera itself
that's worth mentioning if you're planning on uploading these photos to social networks
life isn't terrible but I've certainly gotten better on other tablets like I mentioned before
I was hoping for between 7 to 8 hours but on the positive side
Lenovo keep these tablets up to date even if they are mid-range tablets
because you can only get to it when you're on your home screen
the good thing is lenovo does give you the option to disable it
they're actually better like the front-facing speakers and the higher resolution camera
tablet feels very strong and there are no plastic conscious when bang
nice printed and all the buttons and ports on label 19 near bottom
Lenovo Intel and Windows but they can be removed with some effort on the back
a birth weight is 375 grams and the thickness is nine point
all corners are rounded and device is convenient for holding with one or two hands
applications will work good and observe is pleasing experience given the fact
installed we will install desktop applications and run them with no problems
Lightroom and it worked fine for basic use but not for professional work
memory is low and in run with hard drives which is disappointing
they don't need a battery so never have to recharge it and notice
we've got 10 spare nibs no different types of nibs for different purposes
then we've got a table comes with a nice rubber tie
here nicely built same quality as in the medium and the large
you just change the handedness to left-handed you draw here and use your right hand
they all work with the pro pen - they have the
this blue light flashes on and off means it's in pairing mode
let's choose connect now says it's connected and we can see on a screen
everything is connected all right and we can see our window comes up here
we can turn the touch and gestures on or off now
these are actually something that we do on the side of the tablet
let's just go next and we're done so this is the Wacom desktop Center
don't install the driver or they have an old driver features
we're going to go under our settings and here we are inside the settings
notice here that the battery is about 43% so it comes about halfway charged now
the functions enables us to set up the hardware on the tablet itself touch raise
these are a touch settings so we can just adjust these kind of different things
and they wear out their tablet here in this corner so if that's you
so you can some even wear across your tablet however working with the small tablet
I don't think there's so much need for you to map it you know
OK and now that means from this corner is the corner of the screen
you have full flexibility the way you want to orient your tablet okay
so let's look at the first ones the most obvious ones are
that's what these are set for and we can change them
and we're gonna call this undo and now that one will undo whenever
a lot undo redo different things like that and in the bottom ones
what's out having to reach over the keyboard all the time
click and we can do these keyboard shortcuts all these things
some people like to sit the forward and back button and sometimes
so why don't we go down and we're gonna grab our brush
we'll just get a regular brush here and this is our brush panel
we're gonna get a different thickness see as I straighten that up
I can change my brush size very very easily by doing that now another way
just adding a little dip here dropping this into the shadows all right
we're just adding some depth there by dodging and burning with this pin
it wasn't registering and in fact just pretty much every other tablet
the price for the small is two hundred and forty nine dollars
quad-core tablet with an isp display on android 9 operating system
you'll determine if the matrix pad s8 is right for you
welcome back so this is the box that it comes in
it's well labeled with some general info about a tablet to the back
Wi-Fi support and here chose the 5 gigahertz band is not supported
the thermal information shows temperatures holding steady around 20 degrees Celsius
give this video the thumbs up and look forward to my next video where
don't forget to subscribe to my channel and see you in the next one
let's go ahead and see what you get inside the box
we'll go ahead and see what else you get inside the box here so here
and as you can see here we have our power button the volume rockers
our little microphone usb type-c right here on the bottom here
i also love the fact that this glass has a curve to it
so setup's all complete here is the ui looks pretty clean
you can also turn on a dark theme which is pretty nice
another thing about this is is when you turn the screen off
it almost looks like it's 1080p especially on a screen this size
let's um it seems to be definitely a lot smoother than a pub g
the graphics are set to low you cannot set it any higher
scrolling through previous applications pretty smooth microphone works pretty good how are you
i've been busy staying up to date on the latest election news
let me know if there's anything i can do for you
uh but it will work with your sd card just fine
are you really buying a tablet like this for the camera quality
i really think that the video and audio quality are also good enough
so if you're going to use this in home like i have here
the viewing angles on this tablet are excellent as you can see
it is surrounded by plastic but it doesn't feel cheap at all
it feels pretty sturdy in your hand and at no time
i hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did give me a thumbs up
there is a ton of two-in-ones and chromebooks but not many tablets
and then you get the charger and then obviously the 10.1
i even compared it to my ipad pro and it feels almost as premium it
i mean it's going to be smaller than your full-size keyboard
might take some getting used to but i think the keys have great travel
don't be expecting like a microsoft surface pro type of kickstand here
however the hinge does seem very sturdy it holds its positions
it has a 10.1 inch full hd 1920 by 1200 ips touchscreen display
that's rated at 400 nits so it does get nice and bright
it has 10 hours of battery life 4 gigabytes of memory 64 gigabytes of storage
so taking a look at the screen here i think they nailed it
the best way i can describe the keyboard is that it is serviceable meaning that
i think it's a really nice package when it comes to performance
uh you know video editing software downloads and stuff like that
do some web surfing do some research on emailing you know all that stuff
this is perfect for downloading apps and games from the google play store
this thing does hold up very well when it comes to
a 10.1 inch full hd tablet that runs efficiently and runs well
in my opinion a terrific value a terrific device for a student or someone
that's looking for a secondary computer that has a lot of functionality
hello friends welcome back and today we are going to do toss three
which is nice to hold nice to free land yeah the no
there is a aux volume control and power buttons on top
but most of the manufacturer and it stops giving the adapter that is giving us
yeah as you can see the buffering and everything is quite fast
the performance is not bad while web browsing is fairly smooth
more complex pages may take a few extra seconds to load
this also helps make the tablet easier to hold for small hands
such as subway surfers shown here the tablet is also fine for watching
but it can be expanded with the microSD card using the slot
thanks to the durable cover that can stand up to some abuse
the snappy processor is sure to keep kids entertained with gaming streaming Netflix
okay guys now we what we are at the actual reveal
we need to install the drivers so cut to the computer
we're at the computer and right here is the link of the of the files
say that it's bad and you should not use the circle tool but apparently
this drawing tablet asked me to to do a review on the channel
so here it is just unpackaged it so uh I am
hopefully this video will kind of help you out in making that decision
we have the tablet enclosed in a very soft sheet of whatever that is
was it getting damaged by how it was placed so of course
looks super good and by the way that little red dot in the corner
you can basically have it at any sort of angle you want
which is super useful for mapping different functions depending on the software
I don't think this is the fault of the tablet itself
it has that little pressure bubble that comes up on the screen
I think those are the only two complaints I have about this thing
so if you're interested there will be links in the description to it
this is the VTech light-up baby touch tablet and it's super super cute
and then you can see the tablet itself of course before drawing with the tablet
it's pretty bright so i'm just going to give it a focus here
just enjoy the speed paint for now so now bye me
just kidding it feels pretty good to draw on and i got comfortable right away
the response time of the pen is really good as well
knowing that there are a lot of screen tablets that are really really pricey
we go put this away get it out of there all right
I am the takács and here back with another case review for the 2015 Amazon
highly protective stand handle case built out of a really rigid foam
so it's very very protective wraps completely around the the Amazon fire tablet so
let's go ahead and stick this in here and I could show you
Oh kinda is a tight fit you just kind of work it around
the speaker and of course the front camera is not covered at all
take the tablet out to get to that easy access to it
the the fire tablet doesn't have the best camera in the world but like
that's very very protective and easy to grab and go right
basically on all the social media so let it checks out otherwise
the first thing that stands out on this tablet is the build quality
he has the volume up and down button and the power button at the bottom
I'm gonna switch it on so the button and she's switch on Sony switches on
it doesn't go to you like how you have to login with your username
you have to set them up on your own by going to the settings
one good thing about this screen is that it plays back 4k video okay
that's probably the best thing about this tablet and it's a 8.4
it doesn't have no screen protector or like a case so okay
ram and 32 gig internal memory but you can also put a micro
ok so you know you don't have to worry worry about taking forever
we're gonna give your downloaded some game that does take up couple of gigs
ok camera wise is so bad meaning okay probably has a think around think okay
you can see that haven't downloaded anything when I was trying to go back
you see they had to press a couple of times to actually go back
okay so it does take the phones and it also saves on this side okay
hello my name is Peter parfaits and in the next few minutes
you're using a stylus or pen like this with no wires
and if you're then gonna get one of your photographs on the front page of
then you've got to put a significant amount of effort into that now when
I really didn't want to be there but they weren't under my control
there was a person walking by and so on and so
the tablet can detect pressure from the pen at 2048 different levels
it's going to be thicker if you don't like what you see there
I've programmed one of these keys to be a delete key and so there
and you can set that however you like lots of different options
I'm just going to show you one simple example of this
I don't have to keep altering the size of the tool
run of glue doesn't look very clever and there we go
it detects the edges quite nicely however it still does help when you're using
I want to do and then I have that there copied add a new layer
and let's fill this the nice soft the way we go so they were
I'm not going to describe now but you can look those up on the Internet
Express keys instead of the 8 that we've on this machine
I've enjoyed doing this and with any luck for my birthday
I'm going to get the small touch version of the insurace 5 thank you
First of all, if you like this content, give this video a thumbs up.
I am going to do a full unboxing of the Fire tablet
and you're going to be amazed where this actually outperformed the almost $1,000 iPad
I always wear shorts when I'm wearing a shirt and tie.
I did a video on how to instantly make your Wi-Fi speed faster.
That's actually by a second, right. That's unbelievable. Let's go back. Let's try this again.
The iPad Pro is generally supposed to be a second faster on video.
We're comparing a nearly $1,000 tablet to a nearly $100 tablet.
You'll notice though that there's not a huge difference between the two, right?
So we're gonna start with a photo on the iPad Pro.
And I'm obviously gonna show this to you guys side by side.
I'll tell you that even switching between photo and video is not that simple.
And now for the Fire tablet, obviously you're gonna get 4K video.
Just looking through the city at this display is night and day.
I would expect the camera to be amazing, and it is.
I'm not going to drop a $900 iPad Pro onto the ground.
That screen's gonna crack and I'm not gonna pay for it.
The only difference is the case itself, and this is where things get very exciting.
I'm going to show you that, no matter what I do
at the time, it held up better than the new Fire tablet.
Pro is more expensive that what you would experience replacing this whole tablet.
Now that I'm back inside, I'll show you that the smashed
I can see all of the photos that I took outside, my video.
Kind of amazing, right, despite all of the smashes and slams that I gave this.
The Fire HD 8 is a fully capable tablet for consuming content.
So you have the ability to control your whole home from this almost $100 tablet.
This is a great way to use this as a control mechanism for your smarthome.
You could even use this as a secondary universal remote control for your television.
So well done for the designers of the Fire tablet, and the iPad
Pro obviously doesn't need me to give it a two thumbs up.
You'll know why that is good, although I don't like the price.
So I'm honored to have been a part of your day. Bye-bye.
I've got my hands on a new two-in-one tablet by Chewie
I'm gonna unbox the keyboard so here we have a case
so here is the keyboard you also have touchpad included with two buttons
the keys themselves feel quite nice to type on the keys are not wobbling around
USBC fast charging the back of this tablet is made completely from metal
the tablet weighs only 686 grams and only eight point five millimeters in thickness so
it's nice and bright and an absolute pleasure to look at so
so you can stream a maximum of 1080p on YouTube through the Android system
so g4s controller which are connected via bluetooth and is connected successfully
10 if we go to system properties so we are running
so let's see how it plays so there you have it guys
I like the option of having both Windows and Android on a dual boot
and it's great how you can change between them quite easily
thank you so much for watching and I hope you all have a brilliant day
you can have the control access automated with also temperature scanning results
Alex and welcome to a new review for today we have
however this is quite normal for a tablet it costs only $79
SD card in speaking about the internal storage out of the 16
I mentioned the YouTube app which is not available from the Amazon storage
it's running a modified version of Android called the fire OS and this particular
because they're so cheap and basically do anything else with it
the fittings app seems to be missing quite a few settings and features from there
so if you hold the home button are like so done come on however since
of course this could be improved but with that the price would increase
pretty sure they're going to be able to get this for around $50 around
hopefully enjoy this video if you did like it press that like button
but we've got a sort of soft plastic touch here on the nexus
it's a little bit harder on the memo pad it's also a bumpier texture
there might be a little bit more lag than you would
experience on a faster tablet but web surfing look works fine
they look fine as you sort of start to come down here
it's also a lower resolution screen which means that when you're on the home
it's not just the processor but also the the display and
if you sort of pay attention to which angles work well
I think for a hundred and fifty dollar tablet this is Brad
I'm navigating through if they want to go out of the kids own
i have decided to recreate the mona lisa in my own
first off one thing i noticed on the tablet is how super sensitive
i don't think it'll be as difficult to get used to this but myself
but that's not necessarily the best way especially for digital art
that's something that i'm not used to so i was very happy with that
that is pretty much my favorite blend mode when it comes to watercolor effects
i make sure to select from the watercolor pack and for example
so if you're interested i have also placed a link to the watercolor paper texture
it might not be for some people but that's just my experience
i do wish that there was an adjustment for it as well
that's not necessarily my workflow and just to compare that a little bit
and the many things i tried to squeeze into this video
if you are interested in purchasing the gaomon m10k graphic tablet
thank you so much for watching and i will see you in my next one
clip it back in and you can use it to watch videos and stuff with
let's take a look at the hardware first full-size USB port
nothing on that side and nothing on that side of this thing there
which wouldn't surprise me right on the front we have buttons
that aren't these are actually is resistive touch green and these require pressure
it means you'd have to fiddle with the harder buns right
so this is a 7-inch screen with an absolutely useless resolution
facebook it has their android market which book we get into
an app store is where you can download stuff from it
i download a dolphin browser which i'll show you yeah hope
I've actually downloaded the market and put stuff on it so it might
I might download it myself back and see in android market on a search earlier
so hey ho angry birds as you would probably expect for a tablet
there's some really weird lighting stuff going on here and I wholeheartedly apologize
the materials clearly very high quality absolutely no flex in it whatsoever
sadly did come with a manual manual is written in fairly good
English but it does have some gems such as a one there
please do not place the hot in hot environment especially in summer because it knows
it's like if if some reason you destroy this personal camera there
so it's all the same as its s in the tablet itself
it's very light but as long as you have a big mouse mat
then it's not going to slip anywhere if like for rubber
I don't know how much the the one with the buttons I
I got this one sent to me personally from the company from China
Krista oh it's on the side you plug it in from the side
there and the damn thing is out there so oh well
so that shouldn't be a problem really but it's just something to keep in mind
it's the content better but I understand for the price range that this template has
it's actually quite hard for me but I think I did pretty okay for them
I guess but I will say that it is absolutely perfect for a beginner
it's it's cheap it's like what was it 20 euros or 20 dollars or something
Huyen I can't even pronounce your name but good on you you you you
our battery which meters claims can give you four hours of continuous usage
it also came with an adjustable basically display so i can adjust it anytime soon
when you're mostly known for just drawing on the non-monitored tablet
i believe the canvas 20 is actually a really good price for people to use
and it's a really nice thing for people to switch over
I didn't have any technology for easier to the public so personally
there will be no problem with a just in the area
and the fact that this tablet sells for around 100 quid
and if you're interested in finding out what that was like keep watching here
you go looks like there's some bubbles here on the screen protector
you've got a three pin uk power plug a usb a2 micro
you've got a two megapixel front facing camera around the back
an eight megapixel camera complete with an led flash here on the right hand side
the cover does feel a little flimsy taking it off also reveals
the tablet supports a max micro sd card capacity of 128 gigabytes on the top
but leave it on unless you want to scratch up that screen
there's no getting away from that but don't get me wrong
is that when it comes to wi-fi this device also supports the 5 gigahertz span
graphics looked terrible and it was so laggy it was just unplayable to be honest
i'm surprised i have ran at all but the performance was exactly what i expected
graphically intensive games are the way to go with this tablet
as long as you don't try and push it too hard and taper your expectations
i was quite surprised that i was able to play hungry
so gaming is something you'll definitely be able to do with the k10
don't have great cameras but if you have to know the cameras on
the video also isn't that great it lacks in vibrance and clarity
it's a tablet and it can take pictures and record video as i mentioned earlier
the speakers remind me of those singing musicals birthday cards i got a while ago
fortunately the tablet does come with a 3.5 millimeter standard headphone jack and bluetooth
i left a live tv channel streaming on youtube after seven hours of continuous streaming
although not all games it can run most casual games fairly well
i thought i wouldn't be able to recommend this to anyone
it just works well enough and those are the key words
I could not find any actual video reviews on this product not too shabby
there's not too much to get excited about in the box
probably soap that you and your boyfriend can share gay photos together
apparently max view cannot translate Chinese to English a quick glance at the box
welcome to my channel and as you can guess from the intro
and what are the benefits of having a graphics tablet okay
it's up there with apple versus mac and canon versus nikon or sony
he ended up switching back to his standard mouse because his hand was sore
i've had issues in the past with drumming with bad technique
it'll actually be quite sore and painful like to stretch it out
it works every time it has a customizable buttons on it
both of these are offering over 8 000 levels of pen pressure
i'd ever set up on it and i stopped using them
when you're using it and that's what's so important about it
i use the pen when i want to use the trackball mouse
i think this is geared for this is really geared for the people who not
you should be looking to make sure that your work is perfect
it's a third-party affordable option that you don't have to put the expense into
i just want to say xp pen did not give me this graphics tablet
not everyone can get it can get around that coordination issue so do give it
ring that bell to get notified for the next time i post a video
i post a video every thursday and follow me on my social medias
you'll find me everywhere on mark duffy photography whether that's facebook instagram
sometimes a little bit of twitter and until the next time later gators you
I'm father hood that is there and this is live from the two perps Z's
you go the to burp edition of live from their nursery rhyme
wow you don't never use a guest so dark in the mornings
Daddy yesterday that Daddy could have some of your toast if he wanted
no that's just daddy other check him out the chips you know healthy
can you press sky tells you all the popular character sir
his outfit when the jungle makes it look like a kind of 40-something executives
they've got like a whole bunch of these various models different sizes
this one is the mid-7th got a couple of different features
and this one also has a camera up here in the corner
so that's how a couple of differentiating factors from the other 7-inch
we just got some volume buttons right there and then the back is pretty plain
we just got a little speaker up here in the corner
right here as you can see that gives us lots of options for customization
I found that it's actually surprisingly adequate as you can see stuff
so as far as the processor goes as far as single
obviously dual core is gonna get you some more speed but from what
actually we've got some different games on here and they work well in
Reverse space of course so this is what the game I have tried on here
of course the touchscreen it works pretty well the capacitive touchscreen on the Coby
actually okay as you see out here there's no Google market new Play Store
it works for the most part some of the other apps
let me go ahead and show you some of the video playback like
it doesn't get rid of that like what it does with the other tablets
you've got the different widgets but you can have weather widgets on here
you can move them around and that's a little gallery widget for the pictures
there's some of the stock photos that it comes with the biggest deal
it's the main thing that holds it back from being a decent buy
you're lucky if you get five hours of battery life out of this thing
so that's just been sort of my take on the COBE cryos 7 inch tablet
I've got this full written review right here with the budget information
hey everyone i hope you're all well today i'm going to be doing
i don't really know what a good comparison is so the usb usb interface
i'll take the actual tablet out of the wrapper in a second
i should have maybe open the packaging before i start filming okay
spare nibs and there's quite a few of them so that's always good
so yeah you can see all the the shortcut buttons they're round
and you'll have a zip file which you need to extract
and then you'll have the little icon for the tablet pen
you might want to play around with that but it's no big deal
the tablet itself is seven by four inches as the tablet as a whole
obviously the actual drawing area is a bit smaller than that
um but in my opinion this is like the perfect size tablet
i had to adjust it slightly to suit me but it was otherwise fine
i think all the deco series actually comes with a free download of artrage lite
it saves you shedding out a load of money for something
i didn't find it lacking particularly in anything that i needed
i believe the deco mini 7 is 49.99 from xp pen uk
trying to find a new tablet or wondering about this particular type of tablet
i hope you're staying safe and are well and everything else
Pro I had to push a little more to get the same line
this little battery list pen had previously with my way on tablet
action set up while the touchscreen idea is cool on paper
I tested it on including paint tool Sai Photoshop clip studio paint and carita
it'd be much better if they were just solid buttons that
hey what's going on guys the CTA praten back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at Walmart's all new on surf tablet pro
you're gonna receive a few coupons like $10 off your grocery purchase
USB type-c cable and a 1 amp 5 volt charger now
now that's pretty much it for buttons on the unit but up top
we do have dual stereo speakers and I have tested these out
they actually sound pretty good for a cheap tablet aspect schoo
we have the mediatek and four cores at two gigahertz for the GPU
that comes pre-loaded on the tablet and we also get three gigs of RAM now
that definitely doesn't seem like much but with these cheaper tablets
they're not as good as let's say the new Amazon fire 10 tablet but overall
are the cameras on these tablets because most of them are garbage
I had to run some benchmarks on both of them on the left-hand side
we have the new on tablet on the right hand side
the 2019 Amazon fire 10 HD this is Geekbench 4 unfortunately I couldn't get Geekbench
5 Orion 2 to to run on the Amazon Fire HD
I also tested Amazon Prime video and Hulu but here we have some Netflix
Plus it'll work out just fine so with video playback out of the way
it's gonna work fine all of those run at full speed
I used to draw something on drawing paper whenever I had time
there are top of the class tabs available for around 40 to 50 cakes
but this one right here is more than enough to start with
hi guys it's been such a long time since we last did a tablet review
also i cut off all of my hair because why not so fluffy now okay
it has eight express keys as well as two in one dial express ring
and you can power the tablet directly through your computer's usb port
but we'll get back to that in a moment in this white box here
you will find some anniversary items from xp pen along with a drawing glove
are all of the power supplies this one here is the actual power supply
its design has been slightly updated and it has a really nice rubber surface
the stylus has over 8 000 pressure levels and it supports up to 60 degrees
the innovator 16 display itself is wrapped in two layers of protective foil
i'm disengaging my party mode because it's time to set up this baby
you can choose either windows ios or a beta for linux
here's a little sped up run through of me setting up the 8 express keys
the second dial is the blank one in the middle which is controlled by touch
i was most concerned with because all of my other xp pen tablets
one the innovator 16 the parallaxion is so tiny you barely notice it at all
the innovator 16 is in my opinion the best competitor and alternative to wacom cintiq
and that means that this tablet right now has a discount on it
i'll do what i can to get back to as many people as possible
BSE this is a 7-inch tablet for kids ages 6 and up
because we think that's very important in the kids tablet for this reason
but like we said the big thing is the blue morpho
just take you through this to give you a little example here okay so
it really all is educational and then they throw the game element onto it
um and that's it when you get this you get over 400 different games
it's one of those things for 79 bucks you know maybe during the holidays
they pulled out of the box and they can start doing stuff
they get enough points and this is actually being sold through
I think that gamification is really going to work with kids
I just want to show you that and just want to show here
this is the treasure box and basically this is kids curated apps
if there's something which is maybe a little bit less educational more fun
if they do their chores the amount of time they spend
you need a tablet to do some stuff and your kids have the knobby
they've got all these different apps educational experiences and that a safe environment
you know it's only available between the hours of 4:00 and 8:00 p.m.
you can also have things kind of based on what they do
so the reporting aspect is pretty neat and something you want to get an
the other big part of it is just kind of the safe environment
this tablet one because of the rubberized a bumper around it
well and parents going to feel a little bit better about their screen
hello it's me and i think you're wondering why am i showing my ugly hands
this is the box that it comes and i think it's pretty looking
i don't know what else to say about box but i like that
so let's open this and see what it has on the inside
it looks way more professional than the other one i had
we didn't wacom into a small um i think the design is like very cool
but maybe that's because i'm just used to wacom um the cable
okay inside there is a thank you for supporting us card
there's great guide on how to start up a warranty policy
i did not need to restart the computer just to make it work
it felt weird to use so much fresher on the pad tablet
it was just mainly my fault for not being able to get used to it
okay so i used this tablet for a couple of weeks and it did
not glitch did not do anything stupid like the driver crashing or anything
and then i found out two other teachers are using it
it's just so much better quality than what i used to have and another advantage
i think that you can use this as a teacher and a student
it felt good even though they told me not to use it
uh clip studio paint paint tool sai version one and two
another advantage would be that you can just take it anywhere with you so disadvantages
there are not many actually and i'm gonna just say that with the phone option
it is a little bit weird to get used to it
so check out the description and leave a like or comment
ask me questions you can ask me anything and i'll see you on another video
we're taking a look at the new amazon fire tablet now
that would kind of mimic the same thing that the more expensive electronics would do
this tablet retails for 50 and as far as specs go
if you have seen a lot of retina displays in ultra hd displays
this tablet has every single thing on the top of the tablet
we have the volume jack and then we have the volume rocker
we of course get the amazon app store which has a lot of apps
now now this does come pre-installed with a ton of apps
in this so you can add like little stickers to pictures and things
the great thing about this tablet is that anything you open up
are you reminded that you only paid 50 for this tablet
this actually manages to make those 50 dollars worth it now
it takes nearly four hours to charge but the battery itself is actually quite good
or you know actually want to use this tablet so first off
actually if you wanted to create some documents on here and write up some papers
it won't be very efficient or quick or easy to do
what's going on guys the CTA Prime back here again today
we got a nice little spec bump here plus some new colors like with all
this is known as sage but they offer three other colors
the download speeds are really good for a cheap tablet like this bluetooth
OS C point three zero which is based on Android 7.1.2
this is coming in on the very low end of the scale
I've been able to run this on a ton of different devices
Prime video just wanted to show you a work in here
Kodi on here use a custom build or play files from the SD card
that are gonna run fine like Mario Kart rampage or super
I'm still using that Bluetooth Xbox controller and I'm using retroarch with PC SX rearmed
all of the lower end consoles are going to run fine on here from
here's SNES and I'm still using retroarch with snes9x runs at full speed
Kodi if you want to so that's pretty much it for this video guys
ok battery life only 4 hours that means after 4 hours
tablet has a camera but it doesn't have flash on the camera
it's important to mention that and also have a external memory card slot
here the headset adapter of course volume and the charging port
hundreds tablet or smartphone has and the display is this resolution
let's go to menu settings in you go so seeing mode
so here you can set everything to aromatic and so since
I don't have any any flash so you can actually set as a nine
these are the picture sizes that you can take on this tablet
that's the one that you can choose on that and let's go in open so
I took some pictures on this tablet outside and okay and these are the
I mean a pass and continue so you can pass a video continue recording
probably you're wondering about this tablet and but i'ms I mean it's a good
you can receive notification of our other tutorials related to this tablet
hello everyone i'm going to review the xp pen deco 01 v2
i want to give a big thank you to xpen for giving me this
and this is the main cord for the tablet for connecting it to my laptop
this is the tablet screen protector and this is a cute little
i also forgot to mention these buttons in the previous footage
the pen pressure works really nicely and there were no issues with the driver
thanks so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video bye
this guy has a so-so display and a plastic non removable back
who sees no screws here and for no access to the battery
that's can do things like HDMI out with an optional accessory
and you can set up social networking over here this will do either
if they're available it just takes you right into the music player and there again
as mentioned the second instance of the social networking widget up
Froyo and tap over here you see all of your applications
they are arranged in pages like so in alphabetical order and yes
for example the buns of course are obviously designed for landscape orientation
they are facing down and missing just like with the speak
Android search button so we have three on four standard Android buttons
the pixels are just basically too large and beyond that the viewing angles are up
it's a rebranding a mobi teething and we'll take a look at that
that's included there which seems to be pretty much included on every
so it's the same thing you'll see on your smart phone
so it's a little bit me but the frame rates are absolutely fine better yet
now I'm going to review about the best tablet under $300 on the market
we may not get a chance to change the price mentioned in the video
it has a battery which lasts for 10 hours of operation
the tablet measures 10 inches and features built-in dual stereo front-facing speakers with Dolby
connectivity which allows the connection of a lenovo bluetooth keyboard for productivity mode
another key feature of this tablet is the 20 hour battery life
it can run for 11 hours before a recharge making it
a great option for getting through the activities of the day
if you are looking for a kid-friendly option then this is the right choice
the tablet set time limits on the tablet and apps using the parental control option
with this tablet you may need to buy an SD card to enjoy its use
this tablet has a front camera and a rear camera as well
but that's just an additional features that he has packed into it
it also comes with a 2 gig ram and 32 gig internal memory
it also provides a lot of grip as well so while you're holding it
the main screen is the scratches you will get on the screen protector
it's literally like here at any kind of android and smart devices
who's the main account holder administrator except for location security accounts here
there it also comes with google system and about the tablet build quality is amazing
and it's a budget price tablet that i do highly recommend
i'm not going to lie but you know what it gives it
more of a premium feel because it does have pretty solid specs
hello and thanks for joining another review today we have the Polaroid p10 10.1
Big Lots I'll give you a basic rundown of the specifications
HD video output by way of the mini HDMI port adapter not included
you can go into the settings and they have a for the display
you notice the keyboard is very responsive seems to keep up with your keystrokes okay
maybe well they all have a little bit of a quirk to them okay
I mentioned it earlier but I don't think I stressed enough
it's not as comfortable to hold as a an iPad or anything like that
it's got a 10.1 inch screen and octa-core CPU and it runs Android 9.0
I'm gonna do an unboxing go over the specs and then we'll put it through
its paces to see if it's worth picking up now the first thing
CPU manufacturer but we're gonna find out everything about this tablet in just a second
inch tablet but it seems like it should be a little lighter than it is
it is constructed of aluminum and it has a six thousand milliamp hour battery so
the tablet does have dual stereo speakers over on the left hand side
there was only a sound recorder and an FM radio pre-installed
they claim that this screen is running at 60 Hertz but I beg to differ
here's another quick test running separately from the first one you saw this is retroarch
I'm going to load up a game have the FPS counter
it's locked at a maximum of 50 and that's really unfortunate even viewing videos
they sound pretty good and it gets pretty loud next up
I'm here and I know people are gonna ask about it
I couldn't recommend this tablet specifically for a game like this so in the end
it's a definite pass on this tablet for me at least at this time
if you have any questions let me know in the comments below but like always
I'd but now we're taking a look today at the Chewie high nine
they will come out and meet you when they say they will come
we had a really fun time with pulse here in the studio
sometimes one device to the next might be a little different in this case
and that's one of those things you run into with these devices
this morning we had wiped down the screen and got it all cleaned up
and you'll notice that when you're reading text and other things on there
three hundred and forty eight point six grams or twelve point three ounces
I'm gonna switch out of this now and go over to goat simulator
which is another 3d game here on the platform and you can see here
we've looked at recently in this classification these 8-inch tablets so that
there is a camera system on here not a great one
it also does video 1080p at 30 frames per second no stabilization
the front is a little 2 megapixel selfie cam here again
I usually see better stuff out of Chewie than what we're seeing today
it had a little technical difficulty getting it into the case but here it is
then these have you can get to the volume buttons here
it's not all that well if you go right to left
if you're not using it which reminds me the battery life on
it's one of the things that comes built-in it comes with a lot of typical
it is difficult to see your tiles with the like the names of your kids
there don't appear to be really any games at all now
apparently that if you install flash they'll have but everything else
so you're probably gonna want to download one of your own
that's kind of the biggest fault looking at it right here
it's a little bit slower than other tablets or phones that I've used I date
crack the screen also not too bad so to finish up
I'd point out before I think the case is really nice
it's a lot thicker so it's gonna be easier for small hands day
you know kind of get around it if they're not all that coordinated yes what
I want to conclude is that you're paying $60 for a tablet
because it's not a name-brand that's not going to be the case
it also needs to be hooked up to the power supply
which makes it really convenient to carry if you travel a lot
you have to install the drivers so simply hop on to who
the tablet seemed to be perfectly calibrated when I first started using it
it really makes it feel like you're drawing with a pen so for some reason
of course that is the same resolution as the Nexus 7 so
hopefully give me a bit more money but otherwise looking at the same feature same
the operating system now gets a name there she call it fire
you get all of your application icons over here so it's a bit more intuitive
I've just put that up there so all this stuff is actually on the cloud
we have Dolby Digital Plus audio and stereo speakers that are on the back now
they're up here pretty easy to see through the glossiness on the top
is loud enough clear enough info enough and I can hear it
you can clean it up at the damp cloth just fine so we have
this is our power button right here on the opposite side
get the award for being some of the most tactile buttons ever
you swipe down you can turn your auto rotation on and off quick access to
it's a lot easier in the eyes and there's no glare this
do we have quick control of our music playback over here and here's Mayday
they can't see you don't worry and they can hear you
Amazon account you can actually enter your Google account and here
we have our language selection you can also choose keyboards and Bluetooth keyboard languages
you can go ahead and do them for those of you
feel a bit more like a book kind of aspect ratio
so there's a difference both going to have the same resolution display other than that
Amazon claims 11 hours of mixed use time and 17 hours
if you're just reading and pretty much that has been on target
we've been managing about 10 and a half hours of mixed use including watching
we hope that we see some more killer 3d games on here
we have bluetooth on board as well works for things like Bluetooth keyboards as ever
so for those of you who have a big investment in Google
I mean the free ones because they'll probably available to here like we have
i've got chrome which doesn't come on here just so you guys don't get confused
I did add that a little Google Play services gmail works fine by the way
now there's a magazine that I've downloaded so you can see
meanwhile we'll take a look at books and Stephen King's latest book
I've been reading that book on the paperwhite and it knows that
obviously there's an accelerometer so it's going to rotate with you
Snapdragon 800 CPUs and any of the fastest CPUs available for mobile devices today
we have the silk browser as amazon calls it which is just a fine
so there you go embedded video plays fine and just for fun again
seven inch is going to work for you if you watch a lot of movies
it's just a lot more immersive when you get a bigger screen
I just wrap the cable around it and stick it in my bag
these are the buttons like that you can program to whatever
I don't know like it seemed exactly the same as the companion
I don't know I guess if you hold it like that you can
it's not the it might not be as good as the companion to
I'll mention is that the cable is really nice and long
sorry about the dirtiness but it just goes to show that you know
it's a real-life honest-to-god review of the Wacom Intuos 3 and I think that's it
I think that covers all the bases so basically actually let me
a whole tablet was like warped a little bit or cracked or bent
you'd have to put it through to crack or bend it
but um but it's really convenient and easy just kind of going like this
it makes it more convenient to make like a long line
IPS display it comes with Android 9pi with no bloatware it's got three
gigs of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage expandable up to 128 gigabytes
please use those links because it helps me keep purchasing products
we'll go ahead and just put that aside for just a second here
I said before it has a really good weight to it
so let's go and talk about the build quality real quick like
it's not super light but it's not super heavy as well
the whole backing of this as well as the sides is made of aluminum
I am starting up the tablet and there's really minimal light bleed
this is the first screen that you see so the first thing
I want to touch on for the UI is the smoothness
I really don't have any complaints as far as the UI
know right in front of you and a fairly quiet environment
we're go ahead and let you listen to the sound here
play one of my videos so we are at full volume right now like
I said it definitely is loud enough for your personal listening
the battery life on this tablet is also pretty good for my testing
that's pretty much the scenario that a lot of people are going to be using
half way is going to be about that and for eight hours of battery life
you're going to have to manually go into the settings and lower and higher
I think it's a pretty good size for what it is
it is a little bit thicker than the galaxy but again to me
that's really really not a determining factor or whether or not
I think it's perfectly fine for what you need to use it for
I've already added some apps and everything but as you can see
this is a 1080p screen but the quality of the screen is really quite good
if you look at my little logo down here you can perfect
it doesn't get super bright and bright enough to where you can you know
see everything easily in direct sunlight but for the majority of the time
it does definitely download quicker than the 2 point 4 gigs
G I just kind of want to show you what it was looking like
this is on the lowest setting so it's still definitely playable
it's not super bad so you can still definitely play it
I think are even better than the video capture another thing
I was really surprised at is during charging and usage of this tablet
I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did give me a thumbs up
I hope you have a great day and I'll see him the next one later
I've got something new for the f-150 as I did in the last video
they do not have anything in the box at least not the box
so the funny thing is the tablet has some redundant features over what you know
this thing does on its own your stock stuff like it has its own equalizer
there's two different kids one for automatic one for without but
I don't like is the fact that when you click music it comes up to
does this where you can change two different types of media now
although it is pretty interesting how you can see me super our
you don't need to hook any of the stuff that comes up with this
I can't remember how to get to her at this second
for instance let's see if this will work doesn't always work
I mean this thing isn't perfect but it is pretty cool
I mean it looks neat especially if you've got you know the big center stack
but the wow factor let me know what you think guys sorry
that stellar turned out to be amazing in the long run and vice versa
gameplay that is so without further ado let's get to the tablet so
what the [ __ ] happened so this is what happened
you know the box that came in and had a huge gaping crater here like
what happened there from my understanding of this during the transportation it got screws somewhere
ok um has a bunch of like inputs on the other side here
it's like the color screen to and then that's when you can use your pen
not really sure because the color is the hill now that I see it
I that I have to just move around for the tablet pen usage
it's a g5 40 84 30 pen that comes with it
warranty whatever extension if you like to like share on facebook thanksgiving card
you won't need if you know what you're doing a SD pen pen driver
10 didn't work so I could literally just rate the city and happen
this gave me this artist antifouling glove that they could use for drawing but
I'm not going to be drawing as for Oso gameplay it looks like this
how was it it wasn't like as great as I had expected to be
that will so that was my like a grain of salt well using that
I'm pretty sure I was really fine when trying but like for really really high
I didn't think it was anything to be praised that you you so yeah
I go I just wanted to give you a very very last minute
it's kind of like standard for most wireless products and this loop here although
well make a better CD and the rest of the stuff is just like whatever
yeah so if you do have any questions leave your comments down below
please don't forget to like the video if you liked it
I've just wanted to show you what comes in the box so here it is
kids were quite excited when it arrived and it comes in its case
so this is the tablet as you can see it comes in
it's not gonna get too damaged if it's dropped or which obviously happens
because they won't they'll have to have it if they want to understand
I think there could be room for improvement or things that some people might find
I don't think it will be that much of a problem
and if you'd like to read my full review of the new generation
Kindle Fire 7 kids edition tablet pop over to wwm a few mums calm
I need it to Wi-Fi it looks like forgot to do that
so make sure that actually check out a part one review
we did unboxing for this table pad we showed you the build of it
so it has about one point three five gigabytes after the pre-installed apps
this is a our Nova seven child pad it's running Android 4.0
let's check out apps camera so while you might idiot there is uh
it's actually only for web chat if you've already to take a picture
I don't know when you're taking a picture of this way
this is a great gift for anyone that likes to watch cartoons
so that's enough for me watching that and probably for you guys as well
I'm sure it's like a little bit slow today so again
just go to the club other local sites even though our site is still downloading
okay so it looks like there's probably something wrong with our site
that's the negative side of it but let me go through the positive things
so that's the good thing about this but a lot of tablets
have that kind of feature if you download the app from the App Store
SD memory card and pour on the right side as well okay so also
that's the exclusive case that's made by dragging and dragon touch bother than that
okay and you can find a better one for that price
USB connection to connect the tablet with the pc the included cable is 150 centimeters
so basically undo and stuff like that right here these sixteen software or function keys
it comes with a built-in rechargeable battery that you can recharge with the included cable
while it's charging the pen can be used and doesn't power up
let's get to the unveiling of my piece of art a masterpiece
it also deserves my silver award as it really delivers for its price
Davian Bell founder ghost either forces a teammate and game designer
I'm here doing a review for a new tablet that he just ordered
sylvan has the same version that I just bought and right
I open this thing up and take the box out of the box
I have to Inglot just right in order to use it in
let me get this open and I'll show off what it could do
oh my god try the camera quality is it anyway uh
we go so this cost around very sleek design very thin
it's not that big as you can see but trust me when
I say it's just exactly the right size meter for the job
the tablet needs to be charged but it definitely not a pin and C charger
CD has the code the stuff in it so I'm not gonna show that up
I'm gonna get something right now not quite ready to uh well
I'm about to open up paint or sign-in show off some of this stuff
press the star on the keyboard to open up any tool
they sent me a tablet a while ago which i gave away
raid's the hottest mobile game around and it's only getting bigger
a bunch of secret challenge rooms and 12 seriously badass bosses to take on
in the tower the raid team are giving away a super special champion bulwark
and he's also going to be a huge help in the tower against those bosses
if you want to get a huge head start in raid
so i'm assuming it's tailored more for right-handed people to me
the stand works really well and the angle could be adjusted
i really like this tablet and i'm actually thinking of keeping it
we're going to be uploading little animations and renders like these on instagram
and tick tock also make sure to join our discord server for news or announcements
thanks for watching and hopefully we'll see you in the next animation you
whoa hang on hang on a second oops uh wrong channel
if you want to see more vlogs make sure to follow my second channel self
considering for the fact that it's animation and gotcha edits but yeah
honestly i still can't believe i have this thing with me
we're gonna be going to another family day since it's sunday again
we actually stopped at a restaurant because we are actually gonna get something
okay let's see how this goes say hi to the camera
so uh for a lucky subscriber we will give away shout out
okay since everybody is done i guess it's the perfect time to unbox
some 100 000 subscribers 100 after all there are countless other times
smile thank you for all the people who supported me along the way i love
well you can do so all you have to do is long
show google app so now when you go to the left
then you just hit apply and it's going to go ahead and do that
swipe down one more time and you're gonna see this icon
if you want to activate the app draw go ahead and long hold the screen
then go into your option where it says home screen layout right here
i don't have to swipe up but it does feel a little bit more
this app called add guard and basically what it does is block
is that this device does get the the security software support
you could browse on your youtube right here at the top all right so something
it'll come up here on the window and this is the model
i have the 149 model but i recommend the 199 model
that's cool is if you hit the power button twice double click it one two
that's like the grand canyon but you could set up the frequency of it
atmos so if you slide down from the top and you could see right here
another thing that we have is raised to wake and double tap to wake
where the phone or tablet i mean will adapt to the outdoor conditions
if it's indoors it will get lower in the light as well another thing
here it is so you may want to save some information for later
you can actually um you know record the screen right here with this button
and you can just record whatever's happening on the screen and things of that nature
there is another app that i use for things like instagram
when you hit the arrow you can turn on screen right
slide it to this side and now you can pretty much
you won't be able to be disturbed by the apps that you choose
so let's say you wanted to put um instagram on that list
maybe um you know just you wanted to just you know
so this is a tablet that has a 10 inch screen and runs android 10.
that's paired with 3 gigs of ram and 32 gigs of internal storage
the tablet comes in a decent looking box on the front of the box
we have the power button and the volume keys at the bottom
we have two speakers so luckily we get two speakers of this tablet
so if you want to plug in some headphones you can
so if you watch any videos on youtube you can select 1080p as the resolution
that comes in the box is done in just under four hours
so if you watch youtube videos that will work great so no lag for that
the maximum recording resolution for the front camera is 480p where the back is 720p
so that's what you get with a budget tablet like this
i mean i haven't seen any other cheap tablets that have a screen
don't forget to subscribe and i will see you guys in the next one
I thought I'd give you a quick overview of what the proscan 9-inch is okay
probably one of the main downsides to this unit 9 is display
and so that's pretty much toast with connections three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack
the case is quite a few people here in the house
it's a little bit heavier than other tablets that we have
the one gig of ram and no bluetooth is an issue for me personally
it's a really good value if it had two kids of
RAM I think it would be a fantastic value but for what it is
let's see rating a rating out of five again for the price
Littering the comments of that video were repeated suggestions to test out a book's branded
It's the latest generation of E ink from the company of the same name.
Now you can replace it with a launcher of your choice
just leave the display on the fastest setting all the time?
and it's a much bigger issue on a color panel like this.
Onyx is working on the issue part of the reason for all the software updates.
It's not difficult or dangerous, but it is still just another speed bump.
that's impressive but for me falls a little short of justifying its price.
Euro, assuming that display tech is all it's cracked up to be.
if that's the kind of video you'd like to see more of.
nobody is going to beat the ipad when it comes to popularity
tablets and one of the most compelling fire tablets is the amazon fire 7 tablet
you can't expect much for 50 and you can really see
the charging port is another area where you can see that
it has one bottom firing speaker as well which is horrible
fire os is completely different from just regular android in fact
it only comes with 16 gigs or 32 gigabytes of storage
you can really raise the storage capacity up quite a bit
you're gonna have all of amazon's services already installed they're pre-installed on this tablet
well i have to keep going back to the price tag keep in mind
but you have to keep that in mind when you're considering purchasing this tablet

we are going to be taking a look at the wiki pad gaming
Tamplin I'm very excited to be reviewing this product for a wide variety of reasons
it is a mobile gaming tablet with a built in and removable controller
I'm gonna start with what we've got inside the box then
we of course have the wikipad tablet which is a 7 inch
it's a pretty standard tablet if anything it looks like a giant galaxy
fine it's a similar size to that of the iPad Mini
we do have some additional game options on here for example
I'll always pay attention to is how responsive it is as you can see
it's really responsive when going around sort of websites and browsers and things like that
it's very responsive there's no latency or lag when pressing any buttons
you have to bear in mind that this is mobile games
this is a mobile gaming device for games that you can find on
App Store's that you would normally play on something like your phone
so you're getting that out not having to worry about draining
there will be something for everyone on the app store but just bear in mind
I'd much prefer it to the ones with the kind of controller
and then you attach a tablet or a phone on top
it looks unstable and it doesn't look like the products on its own
I don't think looks very nice so I hope you liked this review
if you've enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time bye
which is the nova 3 color so for the remainder of this video
we're just gonna leave it up to you guys to look at it
see how you like the vibrancy the color saturation everything else about it
but they get the job done and work fine for a quick Skype call
the tablet also comes pre-loaded with the mobile versions of Word Excel and PowerPoint
Windows 10 interface allows you to use your favorite applications to get work done
it turned it on and this is what we've what we've actually got so
I know interestingly we've got a an update of stop button there
bugs are gonna be an ongoing issues so yeah big tick
so let me just show you how to set that up
now it's a case of just keeping moving you finger around lift finger
we keep doing this until we manage to to fill up the bar
there we go back on so yeah great function and certainly
this tablet hasn't actually got some just hasn't got the facility for a SIM card
what this is actually is why we have lost it there
don't get confused about it's only for for you actual micro SD card
but it doesn't actually mention that it is actually the fast charger so yes
the the processor that's fitted is a 64-bit mediatek mt6752 except for playing games
let's just have a look at the the pros with it one
it's gotten an hour mininum case and coupled with the touch sensor on the rear
I've had it's light enough to use without using a Bluetooth speaker
the cameras are always always have been a compromise on this tablet
they're not they really are good photographs certainly for talking online talking to friends
no yeah it would be nice to have a compass to to accompany the GPS
we'll save a future model down the line with the SIM card fitted again
I I certainly wouldn't want to be walking about or out and about with this
I'm struggling to find anything to actually fall with this tablet at all
you hear guys today not my usual stuff those of you that watch my live
streams are probably already familiar with the sound of my voice
huion approached me to review one of their graphic drawing tablets now
quick little background on me if you're not familiar with my channel already
I'll be reviewing for this video is the QE on Inspira q1
1k before we get into the pros and cons and speed painting whatnot
packaging aesthetics hold no bearing on the actual quality of the product
know delay and feedback but it is as responsive as responsive can get
I never felt like the brush was lagging behind or jumping around
the q1k has an active area of around 11 by 7 inches
which to me is just about perfect not too big that
holder is a little piglet compartment for keeping all of the eight extra pen
I don't travel with my tablet that often but I've dealt with enough USB
one of the features of the physical tablet is a shortcut
lock that when toggled disables the other shortcut buttons on the the tablet surface
which if you're like me and have a nasty habit of accidentally pressing
those buttons is really convenient and now on to the cons unfortunately
it's not too big of a problem but it can be a little inconvenient
the pen was not battery-powered it just was it just existed
I have no fear however because it does have an alternative option on the pen
my last issue happened near around the end of my picture
the pen would spaz and duplicate layers and shift stuff around
it outperforms my old tablet in just about every area for an extremely reasonable price
it's one flat smooth surface and I'll talk about that a little bit
it's actually made out of aluminum on the back so it actually feels quite nice
Bluetooth and from my tips here I have noticed that the Bluetooth works really well
one of the things that they're in mind is if it doesn't work right away
so let's look at the base for example that's a different type of base here
instead of that long one we used to have its countries
I don't know maybe I want to put some red on there
I can identify this pin because it has a little red
I'm noticing because this thing is over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
there's a ton of different things you can have it to do
those we've got a front and a back button here so I'm going
we can move this around and we can do different things with it there
there's a lot of other things we can bring up other controls
and there's a bunch of different things you can do here
so you can customize some of these gestures which is pretty awesome
so here's the thing we can add different applications in here and have these
so we've got the touch ring and you can see you know
there's the toggle there in the middle we can have it do different things
so there's plenty of in-depth things on how to use the tablets there what
you can do a lot of things but there's no pressure sensitivity
you can't do shading when you have a pressure-sensitive tablet such as this
you can shade like you would draw with a pencil so you can create gradients
I love the fact that works wirelessly the Bluetooth is no lag
in fact one of the things I hate about the new MacBook
hey guys just a quick forward before we actually start the video
I'm going to be comparing it to a lot in this review
everything I said was completely honest because I don't believe in
and it's fastly kind of farming fresh more than the older tablets like the artist
and you get this nice little you know carton inside of this
Mac adapter the HDMI and USB leads for your computer as well as the
it's a combined lead so it also plugs into your tablet
anything past 2011 needs a new adapter but I'm not sure speaking of adapters
I'm using the United Kingdom pin set because I live in the UK
USB that comes with the pack and this actually connects the USB adapter
it was a major major difference to the extra pen artists hats
the touch pad seemed to be a popular feature within tablets
it's very light and it's definitely a wonderful tablet to work with
HD display more pen pressure levels and an overall better performance with a bigger screen
I'm used to having to do it through the pen barrels
you're upgrading from a pad tablet of this is your first tablet
obviously if you don't want to spend out this much money
kicking the buck here and given how sturdy and improve this design looks
I think it'll be far far more when it comes to the artist
I think it's a fantastic piece of care and great for any beginner
my office 10s and continues to function just fine for my art is 12
that's this and this is a just barely under 10 inch tablet
so this is really nice it also being part of the Samsung line
Wow that'd be great for my kids and here's what's great
5.1 lollipop not clear what their upgrade path is for the newer versions of android
here is an audio jack so for all of you people paranoid about your iPhone
this does your audio jack cool okay and it also supports
you don't need the audio jack go figure you can do it either way like
that's really all you need to know except for one really cool thing
probably you're going to say a lot more than it costs
and if you're used to the world of iPads you're going to be saying oh
so you can pick one up for yourself through samsung comm or this particular
what's up guys chicks here bringing you a review for the connect 7
3.5 millimeter jack mini HDMI micro SD card slot and the charger port
life is around 6 hours depending on what you're doing on
here's the Microsoft App Store so you got all the latest apps
they're all the free apps and the paid apps which is really good
i haven't done one for a while and if nothing else that gets me
i'm actually going to be comparing this to like the fire
um there's going to be other ones out there as well
so i'm going to show you that here in a second
and that's where the sd card goes is right down in that slot
um it's pretty much running uh almost stock version of it
um i don't do a whole lot with android and you know
there's a lot more people that know more about it than i do but it
but if you look at device to device uh samsung galaxy a7 lg g2
um but that's kind of what you're thinking so for 139 bucks
it's what you would expect good for browsing good for watching videos
i'm probably in the few weeks that i've been using it
uh camera's not too bad um it's it's a 140 tablet
it's not too it's not bad it really isn't um i wouldn't hesitate
i mean i could show you how it runs on this
and we're going to discuss the new honeywell rt10 tablet jeff
you can get either or the android side is running mobility edge
it are include well number one the mobility edge but number two
we have a short range and a long-range scanner in this thing
it's the only tablet in the industry that has a long range auto ranging imager
the other thing is is unlike some of the commercial grade tablets
so you don't have to send the battery in if it should fail
I have this new tablet by XP pen this is called the star zero 6
it's pretty smashed up but thankfully there's no physical damage to the tablet
let's take a look at the key features of this tablet
this is the USB Drive with Windows and Mac driver on it
when you turn this you can turn it and clockwise or counterclockwise
this is how it looks like when the pen is in the loop
there are six rubber feet and this is where the battery is
so if there's anything wrong with the battery you can replace it very easily
here's a bit hollow as well but I think it's good enough
you just have to push it in and choose the pen at an angle
how the tablet is going to map on to the monitor so
the good thing is when the tablet is due charging you can still use it
you can still draw with a pen no problem at all all right
I can see some light and jitter select jitter there so not 100% smooth
the dry surface is quite smooth but it has a slight tactile
feel which feels really good when drawing on it this is
here you can also use the scroll wheel to change the brush size
drawing they are really minor issues are not do breakers so overall
so the tablet that they said to me is a 15 inch tablet display
I've always wanted a screen that I can draw on that's not an iPad okay
there's a difference between an iPad and a drawing tablet without further ado my sister
I don't know if you already have noticed but it is kind of already open
you can't express yourself through language just express yourself with art
wait so this tablet is geared towards a all levels of artists
then here's the tablet very nice and fit a very portable
oh hell yeah look at that display so upon first inspection
I don't know I guess we'll see what I'm drawing tap
let's do it so this is my voice outside of first secret
this is a little speedrun of me drawing a camera boot
I had months ago and I finally am drawing his persona so thank you
you can do that or if you want to have it tilted up to
this whole entire drawing took like four or five hours but during this sketching phase
I would have to press down a little bit harder for
I did not have that problem with my previous tablet so I think that's
man as far as the eraser toggling I was talking about earlier
okay one of the one of the big things that I also noticed was
it always looks so vastly different going from coloring to shading because like flat colors
the painting is just 2d right but then once you start shading
I actually don't think I really had many problems with it
so this tablet I think it's on Amazon for $379 I believe or 399
if you want to be a pro artist like myself just give this tablet
so thank you all for tuning in and I will see you next video bye-bye
Netflix or YouTube videos while the 8 inch screen is fine for Android
makes it very portable whether you're carrying it between school or work on the side
you'll find the power and volume keys as well as a headphone jack mini
we have the tablet display perfectly secured with foam along with
this comes the box which carries the components that make tablet function
half of the power adapter the pen itself a vga cable hdmi cable
you'll notice that there's multiple nips just in case you lose him
that is when i noticed that the other pen was again
the fact that it has multiple programmable shortcuts 20 to be exact
it's only been available for a few weeks yet on Amazon
it has tons of five-star reviews with an average of 4.7
how does it compare to the similarly priced Kindle Fire HD 10
I guess we're gonna have to just unbox this thing and find out full disclosure
I'll also be sharing my first impressions on design and build quality
nice and clear great colors but as you can probably see
I'm unable to leave the house to get a haircut right now
the rear and front facing cameras are decent enough for your average
during gaming things were surprisingly impressive with very little hardware like when playing games like
pretty much everything there that your average consumer would want a tablet for
technically you're not even buying an Android tablet with the fire 10 HD
it is literally like accessing the internet through an Amazon billboard
of course there is a way to get around this and install
hey what is up guys this is Alex from answered Tech and today
and then down below that you have a black bar with the
I'm going to talk about all the different customizability settings that come with this tablet
you have the ability to change different settings such as pointer speed or double
click speed if you're planning on using this tablet as a trackpad
Wacom tablet is multi-touch so you have the ability to complete gestures in Photoshop
for example such as rotating the canvas and zooming in and out
I bought the Intuos pen and touch tablet mostly for photo editing
thank you guys so much for watching be sure to subscribe to the answered tech
at 360 now this right here is the matrix pad s8 from
and so much more that we will discuss in today's video
Keogh for connecting and sending this tablet out to me for review
I mainly use my tablets for reading magazines checking my email
I was happy to give it a try so inside the box
but we'll come back to that in just a minute also
it's composed of a light plastic backing with a matte finish
alright let's go ahead and quickly run down the specs out of the box
you get an 8 inch screen 12 1280 by 800 hi-def IPS display
it's a 2 megapixel front facing camera and a 5 megapixel back camera now when
and some other things down here display display touch the screen resolution the network
I I guess I've had this been using this for the last three days
I guess maybe two weeks now and honestly this is a very good budget tablet
I actually have to take something like this to push it in there
and so we'll have that clicks all stay in place so
these are your quick settings you have your Wi-Fi connection your Bluetooth
do not disturb auto-rotate smart saving mode airplane mode icon for it
the rear camera will yield the best quality in photos and videos
these pictures and videos that you're about to see were shot using the rear camera
i don't know how to make intros though before we could start
they just sent me this tablet for free for me to review
it automatically does that when it's connected to a phone or or android or tablet
it won't work for you so yeah onto the video though
so the 10 has 8192 level pressure sensitivity which is big enough
and it also has eight express keys and one touch ring
now you have the tablet we gotta download the drive of course though
i don't really have a computer to show you guys how what wait unless so
i'm going to be drawing while using the tablet with fire alpaca
stop bringing it back and of course i know he's literally all bones and bald
let's start off with how i became a sans fan girl
but i clicked on it anyway because it had the word funny on it
funny how minecraft youtubers now are also using that strategy to get views
don't you think though after that i got curious on what undertale is so
we should probably speak in english but they said i didn't joking
don't know uh so like some days came by uh when they transferred
none other than betty from glitchtale with me peeking behind her
drawing undertale made me inspired to draw more undertale and so i did
it was really fun to know that someone related to me
i've seen fandoms and not really undertale and other things as well
puns rude for snails and eating spaghetti was the most special meal back then
this is why you don't go to the internet when you're still young kids
i went undertale peasants oc because of course i was really lazy
uh as i remember she was made for us to cringe at
i always show my art to my friend and they were always supported about it
i don't even know what what i would say about it
oh no no no no no uh it was a dare for my cousin
and for fanfics i would say my cousin my non-existent cousin did that not me
i didn't want to do it but i did it anyways
it went on to the point when i went to my friend and told him
hey the whole cousin thing wasn't true it was all me
uh i liked sans but i was really shy to tell you and they went
even though i am still dumb till this day i am still very hot
if you want to know who that friend i was talking about
i will put their twitter in the description so please follow them
all of this so please sure make sure to subscribe to her
i would like to talk to you guys for a screen tablet
I'm going to do a little bit of a gear review
not only is have the quick buttons for using quick configurations
there's a shift button if I come down here to the bottom buttons
I don't like this change that it did so four fingers up
I can just go back and forth just by using four fingers up or down
that's set up by a actual keyboard shortcut so I can run that action automatically
I want to save this file for any changes that I've done
I can automatically do that and again five fingers down brings up settings standard gestures
you have all kinds of standard gestures that'll do and again
and closing your fingers and you can also rotate your images as well so
I turned that option off because I found my camera here
I found that a little bit annoying with the rotate option
in addition to that the pin is pressure-sensitive up to 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
after having this tablet you may not even use a regular mouse anymore
I think it's just a fabulous tablet fabulous tablet in value
that comes with it if you want to download those once you register your product
this is your guy cly and welcome back to budget buys today
I want to talk to you about the Vaughn Kyo matrix pad s7
let's go ahead and crack this box open and see what's inside
QuickStart guides you're left with a bare screen and you have to find a protector
so let me go ahead and rattle off some specs at you
you have the rear-facing camera as well as the speaker grille now
I know some of you are probably wondering about the audio quality
you can expect out of the past seven and four that
you're going to be able to pick up on a lot more
part of the video is simply because they have public domain movies like the original
it's actually a very competent device as you've probably already expected
this tablet has had zero issue running the standard casual gaming fare such as solitaire
most surprisingly is the fact that the on-screen controls were incredibly comfortable to use
which just so happens to be a favorite genre of mine
I've been using this tablet for is text not only have
this device is hitting the market with an intention of collaboration equipped with premium
Bang & Olufsen audio and a world facing three multi array mic one thing
this keyboard is like typing on any regular laptop making it a great substitute device
hello fingerprint security a pin and passwords as with the majority of new
HP devices another thing I do like though this model we reviewed didn't house
I would like to see become more readily available in future
I was really impressed with the HP Lee x2 1030 g3 as a tablet device
Like and subscribe if you enjoyed the video until the next time
for example behind me here and I'll just scroll across there
you can access them via ethernet and all sorts of things
that's built into this tablet so really really good on power
we found that this device ran a full day for us on Friday
a lot of people seem to accept this form of authentication more basically in
Wacom pen this pen will be fine for taking a lot of notes
Wacom pens just above that big improvement for motion on this device
you probably take take it into the shower with you if you wanted to
there which is pretty cool so you can see this device here
the you know the new modern applications to full screen touch applications
you also have the ability to run desktop applications here so which is really great
we'll have a look at how the tablet performs as a note-taking device
those are just between touch and pen really easy the great thing about the
it's a really good system to use especially on a nice large screen like this
I hope that's giving you a quick overview of the motion r12
they don't have any calluses on them or anything like that
I've actually been using this without a case for quite some time
Asus one so I'll be doing a quick unbagging or whatever of this
I've never really been all that interested in the premium tablets
I personally see this as more as an occasional use device
display again pretty much the same one you're going to get on a first gen
you can add up to 64 gigs more depending on your preference powering
the device we have a 1.2 gigahertz media tech Mt for Tech's a7 ARM processor
Bluetooth and GPS integrated size-wise at 7.7 inches by 4.7 inches by 0.4 inches
USB port a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack a micro SD card slot
you also have the ability to do floating apps and widgets which
I have actually used this for so far here at home
so it's nice for watching videos and stuff or just play music
you can use the app to control media center or Windows Media Center
well not having to use the computer than benchmarking on so it's usually
I'll talk about the build build quality and the build quality is okay again
you're not going to find the sort of rubberized finished or the really sturdy
you're not going to be blown away by it or anything
I will notice some slowdown and some stutters here and there
Asus will list up to ten but I found closer to eight
what put this laptop do to the price points and the performance of it so
he did a video of it over on awesomesauce news so check at least
I know he got it if he didn't do a video on it
but if you enjoyed this video don't forget to click the like button
I appreciate all the words I appreciate you guys watching this video as well
the keyboard is detachable and the kickstand is adjustable to a number of different angles
there's no battery in the keyboard and you can see that
Acer positions the switch alpha 12 as a sort of laptop first device
which is the keyboard the front and the the kickstand itself so
Ikon core i3 skylake processor four gigabytes of RAM in 128 gigabytes of storage
you're using it to do playing games or doing other things that are really
you can edit documents on it anything that you do on the laptop now again
I think on your lap but as a notebook it generally works pretty well
the arrow keys are also the page down page up home and volume
I found a lot of Acer laptops do the display is an IPS
they're really designed for Windows 10 and are downloaded from the Windows Store
so let's go ahead and fire up for instance the image editing application
I'm going to open a web browser so you can click multitasking
so we've got open here and it's a 2160 by 1440 pixels
of course use the touchpad and there is a precision touchpad below the keyboard
it's 680 pixels across in both of these pictures but the web browser knows that
these little icons are pretty tiny and they'd be hard to touch the
I find it a little bit heavy to sort of hold for reading
is it going to be the best solution for everybody not necessarily
I mean if you are looking for something that you can use on your lap
anything that you'd ever want to do with a Windows computer
it just happens to be a tablet that also works as a laptop and typing
um i'm going to just go through a bit of a demo
go through the settings and see if it's worth purchasing this tablet
it also comes with a mouse here as well and which requires
so you've got that option so you've got two options there hold on
okay now as you can see here it takes a 3.5 millimeters headphone
it has the usb type-c charging port and at the same time
it's easy to um close but closely as well but it's easy
there's a chance of actually losing that as well all the time
okay so they also give you a cleaning cloth everything so literally
i've already gone through the setup as well so bear that in mind
this is how it looks when it's um when it's done it's very smooth
now you've got all these things already built into your netflix
life is amazing on this it has 8 000 mah mah battery capacity
okay let me just go to camera first all right so that's the camera
it's very pixelated but you know he does have a front and a rear camera
Journal and today we have the vacuum matrix pad z1 kids edition
it has a cute little wallpaper over here and it's pre-installed with kiddos
so the app just popped up over there so you can just open the app
you can choose from your photos or the wallpapers that are already in the iPad
let's check out the apps that are already inside the iPad
I'm gonna play pizza party all right so this is cool camera features
and there's a front and back camera so let's try it out in this
we don't know but it could be the first to see our newest video
you can comment that down below with the hashtag so for example hashtag blue actually
I'm green just comment down below what you think my favorite color
so i'm gonna pause the music again and i'm gonna do the uh announcement thing
plus um this also means you have to watch your language so no cursing
i tested it on stream by making a short animation in adobe animate
the panel is a very nice looking lcd screen with etched anti-glare glass
the pen is battery free and it supports 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
it goes into much more detail on the huian website something
liking a lot about this tablet is that it doesn't have any shortcut keys
so that it feels like it's actively fighting off any onset carpal tunnel not really
this is the only annoying thing i've found out about this pen
so that's my take on the huian canvas with a k22 plus now
because that's the most important thing to do in any good review video
and in the meh we have no shortcut buttons and a 1920x1080 resolution
maybe i'll upload it to youtube at some point i don't know it's content anyways
we've seen a remarkable change in the plan of chinese goods
we can observe that change from the chuwi hi-pad lte pill too
the all-metal layout in grey color looks superior hiding its funding individuality
the back is easy to touch and also doesn't scratch quite easily
the rear has another design component with a little strip on the left side
the strip really extends into the side that houses the power button and volume keys
it stands out due to its darker color and increases the attractiveness of the gadget
coming to the front the chuwi hi-pad lte comes with a sizeable 10.1
while operating the pill nonetheless you can get used to the bezels
you've got a single usb type-c port using a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
the base of the tablet computer is clean while on the left side you've got
we had been really surprised to discover that the computer keyboard keys were nicely spaced
this weapon reproduces colors fairly well and functions even under the direct sun
certainly charging the pilot to be tagged as an overnight-only encounter utilizing some other usbc
applications because chewy made a decision to utilize a stock version of android 8.0
the computer keyboard case has difficulty maintaining the tablet in a vertical position
the camera is ordinary and charging the battery requires quite a while
thanks for watching this product review video kindly like and subscribe to our youtube channel
naw this is stir you hello and welcome to a very different edition of mark
now if this will do it it'll be worth its weight in
God I probably won't be much though seems to wait very very easily
sorry fog you buy on-board storage which probably will be about 1.4
which your dad had to set up any neighborhood because he was awfully tired
let's unbox this beastie the trustee orange scissors which my wife doesn't know that
things which will hopefully and i'll use to survive the trip
let's see what's inside this sucker so whipping off the lid bench wait
and you don't usually get robust stuff in robust boxes for cheap prices
well that's sounds interesting or via the microsd card slot not supply blah blah blah
if you kill it you've got to take it to the tip
I'm not expecting too much goodness but then have a look
we'll probably have a couple of these line around so stand
bother opening the bag here but it's yep pretty much yeah USB adapter allegedly
we'll put that to one side and let us have a look
well nearly 40 acre who's counting ok so the front place is pretty good
this is probably going to take ages having a bit of trouble focusing
Play Store enabled so let's pop into apps and see what we come here
play store isn't going to be set up because Google insists that everything is tied
Angry Birds Angry Birds download that it's free installed accept & download
I don't want to actually a door actually step away from the monetization process
that's being downloaded and installed as we can see here in a little status bar
hello there's a little bit of a glare there on the screen obviously one thing
let's just move away from the main camera and we'll do that
i think that this tablet is excellent excellent value for money
that book 2 pounds of ebay all sorts of the normal things
you have a budget device get to try skype on it
no reason to believe you won't look how to switch fine test
so let's just have a clip here for educational purposes only learn that film
the keyboard is going to be a selling point on this
we're going to look at it now so this is a windows
it's available with a variety of cpus from core i3 on the lowliest one
ssd is going to sit your batter back around 655 right now and that keyboard
it's not like typing on a netbook of old or something like that
if you jump up and down on it you could break it
the color gamut on this is pretty good you get full srgb brightness
so it's pretty good stuff you know palm rejection is reasonably good
tilt support if you go with the tilt supporting pen either way
and if you do want to get the tilt sensing lenovo precision pen
more demanding stuff that you might do doing a little bit of database work sql
that can charge it up to 80 from empty in one hour battery life on
this thing has some beefy hinges it stays nice and stiff it's infinite angles
you can even rest your hand on it some without it going drooping down
you know maybe a little mobile skyrim might even be in your future with this
so that's not too bad battery life on this is ago
the resolution of the display might not be surface pro level
it's one of those netbook things have you ever thought to yourself hmm
it's very white could be described as plain in fact no branding or advertising here
II feeling plastic on the back but everything is a lot more solid
and there's no give anywhere around the whole thing a lot of the
oh look at that a SIM slot for putting in SIM cards
what is that light sensor or something presumably power button also sleep
oh yes this is what we like micro SD slot and yes
Oh just result on that off the camera I do apologize
you really glad you waited for that on you next up
Silver's right let's turn it on and have a play ok
Windows 7 has a built-in touchscreen II into Phase II thing
a little dot appears a little effect to show you where you tapped
no surprises there really but you scream at me in the street scaring my dog
what do you do if you want to input some text
you have a massive choice of third party keyboards you can install
recognition being if your hand rang is no identical to the person who programmed it
I wanted to do a search for something important like me
we are easy web side not search for that anymore instead
you can use it to search for rude things into everything but no handwriting recognition
not there's anything technically wrong the sound keyboard except it obscures
what else we got right screen size 1366 across 768 down
the people and the dialogues it takes longer to calchas it scans
Hardware here we go device manager Knoll a performance device manager
I suppose perhaps they eat too much battery or cost too
much money's or whatever so how does this actually play back video
Commodore Amiga computer crashing anti clever let me know and piss off
I can get it to play em cavies up to about a DVD resolution
fine since you get to 720p territory it begins to choke on it
unless of course you've got everything in a non MKV format then
it seems to be fine and lovely and everything works like it should okay
I suppose the answer that is about three hours really is as simple as that
Ben failed to tell spider-man right next up webcam yes there's a built-in webcam
we've press connect on this program about going out and Bing oh look it's me
I really hate this webcam because it makes my head look all weak and distorted
pop enough and hiss enough to make it go through the filter probably
I can't imagine this is a problem with the tablets as you know
Apple themselves have a new iPad coming out this year like I don't know
yes she said my god where do I get one how do I get one
you know and his keyboard and all that stuff going on here
he's got it set up to the left of his desk on a music
we're going to mention the other programmer uses for video chat
oh well it's like Skype but isn't if somebody comes through on this
he just sort of presses the answer button and a way
I'm going to review this tablet that we own has sent over for this review
this is the new one zero six zero plus graphics tablet
I have actually reviewed the earlier model that I bought from a friend
that is the old one zero six zero plus so this is the new model
means the accuracy of where your stylist position is and this report rate is 233
it is actually a similar to the earlier pens but it comes with the pen
nibs as well and this is their this is the nib remover
this piece of metal here so I shall put this here like this
this checkbox here allows you to indicate whether or not you are using a tablet
PC but I am NOT very sure what it's supposed to do
where opens up and external dialog box where you can test your pen pressure
let me show you the keyboard shortcuts that I have assigned to the physical patterns
the dialog box comes up so I can do this all right
see some examples here however you can actually use a plugin that is called lazy
Nezumi Pro if you want to have even smoother strokes smoother papers for example
I do not know why now when it comes to latency lag
he can detect pen pressure as well and the strokes they are very smooth
MUX the strokes they taper very well in is cheap too
close this and move on to MIDI Bank paint Pro MIDI Bank paint
this is version 3.0 point one point one so let me see
and it's the post pen traveler - you know like whatsoever close this this is
this is actually an app developed for tablets so you can support
we don't have this as well and it works quite well you can
I think there are some problem with the tapering effect again
if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below
But today I'm going to take a detailed look at the DragonTouch Max
It runs on Android 9 Pie which is still running on a lot
However it's not as smooth as what I'd see like on an iPad for example.
10 works in portrait and landscape orientation making it ideal for reading or watching video.
there's a front mounted camera which is great for video chat.
For photos the back camera is 8 megapixels and the front camera is 5 megapixels.
And on the bottom of the tablet there are dual stereo speakers.
Buttons are pretty minimal on the Max 10 and as you can see
And even though you can see there are 2 indicators for dual SIM cards
And that's mainly because the headphone cord works as the antenna for the radio.
You can also use offline maps thanks to the built-in GPS.
One is the free Open Camera app from the Play Store.
Next you'll need a TRRS adapter like this one from StarTech.
To get the mic set up, touch and hold the Open Camera icon.
Now go into the Video Settings and tap on Audio Source.
10 is a great value for all the features it comes with.
and let's get into it if you start in the beginning of the video
but don't worry you will be only needing a few of these first
after a few minutes it was easy to set it up
you don't need to also use a power adapter only hdmi and usb cable
the graphic tablet on the left side have 11 shortcut keys
graphic tablet the specs of this tablet are pretty good compared to other graphic tablets
sometimes i take stubble into my head and draw like that
i don't really mind it because you can just press the back button
also the depth fell down on the ground like three times
and i'm still surprised you still live and also one time
a lot of the wooden frames on the wall fell down at the tablet
it comes with a pen and then we're about to just review it okay
well what is that little dust a little dust from the bag there
uh usbc's over here in the top right corner bang bang and then look
the only thing they really lied about is the battery life
i feel like this bad dog can handle it like and subscribe
i'll see you next time on rugged rose review thanks for subscribing
it wrapped it in money and then there will be another video after that
Andrew four points to out-of-the-box and yeah the screen resolution is 480 by 800
I mean I don't know if it's just me I was expecting
don't expect too much either because I played subway surfers I played my boy
hey everyone I wanted to try something a little different with this video
the ultra thin flexible graphic tablet marked at 30 369 USD on Amazon
LPI lines per inch and it's basically a measure of the tablets resolution meaning
I was a fool and recorded this while watching something on Netflix on the side
so you don't get to hear the actual unboxing sounds sorry
so this is the tablet pretty small but perfect for portability
I haven't stress tested it but I feel like that might damage it so now
I'll be using Adobe Flash because that's normally what I hand made on
it's like the one that you're working on and pressure test
this would be your whole tablet and by matching the screen ratio
I'd say this tablet is pretty good for sketching on programs
I do a lot of undos if my undo rates have increased drastically
thank you matrix bad as 8 which is really a fantastic tablet running
I tend to go extra mile showing each and everything to a typical user
we're gonna go with the unboxing to see what comes with this matrix pad
only a typical tablet that can meet the basic video and Internet needs
we have a four point two megapixel camera and five megapixel on the back now
rocker switch power on and off button and a microphone slot
you got to get the better response out of your battery life now
you can see that works great on the touch screen as well
now another typical use of this kind of a tablet is the web surfing
you can use your Google Chrome or any web browser you have in here
your cameras are also available in a year front as well as the back
oh now there's another important test which we should not forget to try
yo not bad actually not that bad and you work great now
actually it worked great on it non-medication on my plex server work
I can play any video from a black server right on this tablet
look at that no problem in terms of the navigation as well now
I have shown you everything which I think very important to make a call
I suppose I have cleared everything if you think I have missed anything
please do let me know in the comment section down below as well
what else you want navigation works very good off your web serving
and you can switch between operating systems just by hitting that little
OS switch button which I will show you in a few minutes first
let's take a quick look at what you can do in
it's probably some sort of anti-glare coating although as you can see
so let's go ahead and reboot now the first month or so that
I had this tablet I found myself not really using it much in Windows
Windows I just don't like the the tablet experience as much to be perfectly honest
I don't happen to have a bluetooth mouse but I do
we can treat it like a general desktop or laptop style computer
now we have access to running it in a small moveable window
we can brighten the screen a little bit viewing angles are pretty good
you can find more details in our full review at li'l appearing calm but what
I'm going to open that same image in the blog post
so here's that same picture same number of pixels but the Chrome web browser says
don't get a lot of room side by side when you do things like that
now we can zoom in on the picture make it does a 400% or 200%
menus are really really tiny which can be difficult to use
unless you're holding the tablet right here or up to your nose
but it make it kind of difficult to see what's happening
so that's a quick look at and sort of what you can do
you have to do the same thing you have to wait again
is that when you reboot it messes with the clock for some reason
it's 2 o'clock or a 2 20 but it thinks that it's it's 720
it'll be off by about 4 hour or five hours again
I'm not really sure why it does that but it does that
3G is an interesting option and I forgot to mention this earlier
there's a little button on the bottom says dual OS switcher
there's no way to go back once you hit it so
you're about to be signed out closed and it's rebooting you
you also have four gigs of RAM 64 gigs of internal storage
I'm gonna be doing a review of the Galman s 56k drawing tablet
Wacom pens you will need to put a battery in it
it has a button at the end where you turn it on and off
I've included footage from the screen recording and from my webcam
I work with this tablet if it helps you at all
I said I prefer the feeling of using a standard tablet that isn't flexible
D&D characters I'm gonna be playing her in a one-shot next months
she goes by brandy and she's half elf half hill dwarf
she's short and has a little bit of a 5 o'clock shadow on occasions
I only had the occasional problem with pressure sensitivity which was quickly resolved
I'm not 100% sold on the whole a flexible tablet thing
I'm not sure exactly why I don't think it has to do with pixel density
G tablet and if that is the case then that might be why
we're seeing some of the poor viewing angles but I don't want it anyway
now let's get into the actual product itself as you can see
the ten is really meant to be at home and again
let me take you guys back to the home screen again
I'm not running anything on here yet to control task management
I want to show you guys show you how to go for a second

HD 10 kids Edition tablet Amazon's largest and fastest kids tablet a full-featured 10 inches
hello guys came here and I wanted to talk about the tablet
I thought I think because I I don't like lying I need
yeah sorry for my voice it hurts a little bit but yeah
I can just unlike writing scripts so this is all voluntary and you can write
if you want a face reveal maybe oh yeah that's all for now
No Limits is shown here and you can see a graphic performance does very well
this tablet charging is a little cumbersome because this tablet requires a special barrel connector
which makes it a great choice for gaming and watching movies
it will start recording it and let's see that it records everything to which
well you guys for a little bit and thank you for watching my video
you can pick this up for around 60 euros on Amazon
if you're left-handed she's like so so all the keys can be under
it's also very very light compared to some other tablets one advantage though is the
was that happen in like the first week as you can see
I just use just a piece of blossom kind of plastic here
I haven't even bought a purple screen protector and it still works
fine as you can see the things that shine and now you mind
prefer the feel of it but it doesn't really bother me that much
this is usually my enter button and this could be my eraser button
I really would prefer if there was just no buttons at all
which pretty much if you want to take the nib out
it's very easy and you just return that so the nibs will last
but that's just really up to whatever you do so a lot of people
just keep asking that in different tablet review comments and stuff like that
I just don't use a my tablet works fine without that
that's the top button and you can just go into mouse commands
you want and you can just drag like that so you want to
it does not work if you don't have a clicked on for me anyways
I don't have a ruler but I'm gonna try and draw a straight line
there is gonna be a bit of jitter but even the expensive
there is no input lag at all as you can see so
sensitivity is very nice now if you guys want a tutorial on Autodesk SketchBook
hey guys it's your boy rigmarole here and here's a little story about how
it all started one day when I was checking my emails and suddenly Chyna
Oh rats damnit China thank you for choosing here on so we got wire
I drew oh this is what I drew on the tablet
China's gonna nuke the United States and we're gonna fall out
what games are on the kids side honestly given a lot of different things
but it's all and rebase so if you know it's any
the kid has yeah different access modes depending on what age you have them
you guys have a great day and check out the curio tablet today
yeah it's not an Apple device so that's why the mini the it's mini
it's got a really decent looking screen and I have a feeling
this is gonna be a great tablet definitely for the price
and if you do like this review definitely could be a big ol thumbs up
report nearly got too much feedback on that but input would be nice
hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day you
hey guys crazy today we are gonna review the Wacom Bamboo pen tablet
I could set to your liking via the drivers that you installed to your computer
you could really draw easier than using a mouse and keyboard with this tablet
this is is a very useful program you can get the trial off of autodesk.com
I give this tablet a perfect 10 out of 10 no cons no nothing
I was making, but I wouldn't say it held me back.
The Cintiq 16 features an anti-glare screen with a natural paper-like feel.
Color accuracy is important for professionals and artists who print their work.
The Cintiq 16's color gamut is only 72% NTSC which is okay, but not great.
The Cintiq 16 screen and body are built of durable, scratch-resistant materials.
The build quality feels very solid and doesn't feel flimsy or cheap.
Power LED Brightness, if you want to dim it or turn it off altogether.
If you prefer more options for positions, you can purchase an optional stand.
It makes the display much more stable and easy to position.
The only trouble I had was attaching it upside down on the first try.
This is especially useful when you are moving the tablet around on your desk.
while drawing, it is possible to accidentally power the screen off, but it's not likely.
Wacom offers, but allow me to share a few of the ways
Screen glare can make it very difficult to work on a display tablet.
The Cintiq 16 has a paper-like feel which adds some friction while drawing.
It's the same pen that's included with the top of the line Cintiq Pros.
The Pro Pen 2 is also cordless, battery-free, and does not require charging.
Let's not forget that the Pro Pen 2 also supports pen tilt.
The Pro Pen 2 is the best pen you can get for a drawing tablet.
Build quality is one of those things that you have to feel.
pressure are smooth and easily calibrated for a lighter or heavier touch.
There wasn't any unusual parallax, even near the edges of the screen.
I got exactly the experience I expected from a display tablet.
The Cintiq 16's screen offers a smaller color gamut of only 72% NTSC.
The Cintiq 16 screen has a lower resolution than the Cintiq Pro 16.
The Cintiq 16 offers fewer display connection options to connect the display to your computer.
The Pro models offer USB-C and DisplayPort, in addition to HDMI.
The Cintiq Pro 13 is about $150 more than the Cintiq 16.
The Cintiq 16 includes a handy three-in-one cable which I find convenient.
And even though it's on par with the competition, the Cintiq 16 uses older technology.
If this were my first display tablet, I'd be so stoked.
If you're looking for an excellent, entry-level display tablet, the Cintiq 16 is it.

the runtime of the tablet nice keyboard supports along the sides
but apart from that you really don't need it to run the device
the first one is that the battery life is much longer than the previous generation
so you've easily got all-day battery life on this device in fact
it's a Wacom pen that will work on these devices in Australia
what's up y'all time for another tablet review with more touhou art
it is 22 inches about as big as my secondary monitor
that's great for transport the sticker on the pen however is very sticky
the tablet is very bright and has a very rich color space
each model i received from xp pen has been very accurate color
i reviewed and the one i was using up before this point
it can support both a standard usb and a usb-c connection now
for some reason the cables themselves are actually a little on the short side
it also comes with a cleaning cloth and a glove also one little aside
the innovator 16 actually have this issue to solve this one
but they'll operate like a non-screen tablet until you plug it in
there's a new monitor but the drivers won't until after you restart the drivers
this might be something that can be solved in a driver
since there's no express keys there's no extra windows it just has a simple customizable
anyway here's yomu in a suit it's just kind of too natural of a fit
hey yeah it's me shadow or chad or whatever floats your boat
really if you haven't heard my voice before hi yes i am a gross american
i received an email from gaomon asking me to review their tablet
more information is in the description and later in the video now
nice it's got lots of surface area to maneuver around and mess with the pen
actually the fact that they included a glove in here was awesome as well
i actually still have it on right now at the time of recording this
and that's not that big of a problem all in all
it was very inexpensive for its quality and that was fantastic
hey guys this is big a 50 tablet and in this video
I am going to review it and tell you if it's worth buying
I have already done unboxing and first impressions video about this
I felt in knowing which button you are pressing attention to detail like this on
Mac operating system as well as Windows now in order to connect the tablet
I wish the button was slightly texturized or maybe slightly more prominent
I highly recommend you buy this one and just look at the price
which makes it a very unique tablet so the link is in the description
I've been very own that's the HTC high-capacity cards are accepted speaker
IPS display technology which means nice sharp really wide viewing angles 1024 by 600 resolution
put a w flash on there you discover all kind of sluggish
it's also has twice the memory inside twice the ram that is to run programs
only one gig is available for your use everything else is serve for
Android tablet would say like the HTC Flyer that sells for $2.99
of course if you're rooted you can do all sorts of things to it
it's pretty much the same stuff that we've seen before once again
this is a little small on the seven-inch screen phantes ennoble says
we're looking at our application library of shortcuts to books magazines newspapers
no kids stuff which is really pretty cold and my stuff which is documents
you just have it and there any of you download in terms of books
we've got pretty much again the same thing as with enough coloring here
I've made a bookmark on like any touch screen reader or LCD
LCD display tap near the top and it brings up options here
now when you're reading epub books you're the ones that you've got from
these were both pre-installed out of the box in fact there's Netflix
integration right into the settings you can set your account information right there
so really there's so far doing them the best from anybody
anything that you've used for lend me and archived items so my files
I've put some PDFs so you can see what that's like first
we have a user manual for an upper computer here and again
Illustrated PDF there is no changing point size or anything like that
we have an application called my media and that's for playing
and we've got a music player onboard plus a 3.5 millimeter
jack so gives me the options of using my two music apps here
I'm finding some more music after it's going to go with the straight music player
you can search for stuff loop and all that kind of thing and yes it
it'll take a look at our Kindle Fire video review using Adobe Flash Player
I would say that the Nook is a little bit more contrast II and readable

Piketty knees unboxing channel today we are reviewing the Huyen GT one
Express keys and touch part sufficiently to keep all your favorite shortcuts
wow it's so right my daddy take it you bought it
yeah okay so that's actually get into the product with you okay
aren't that good if you don't when you get a bad one so oh yeah
obviously it has internet microsoft edge for windows 8 and up now
and so yeah so this thing is a really good tablet
all right and what do you think what do you like about it
obviously not books right now but in the future it comes with a charging cable
there's multiple games on here and there's one that she plays
that's a motorcycle driving and you can't crash the motorcycle that's good for little kids
you just set it up with a password and they can't get into it
I had everything up and running and I was ready to start working
I was quite sad to see that there are no buttons on the tablet itself
I usually love to have a few buttons that I can change the presets
it's super fun if you are interested in checking out this tablet for yourself then
I've left some links down below for you to have a look and I really
ghoul inspired character and thank you so much again to huion for supporting the channel
total of forty seven dollars and some odd cents and that does include shipping
alright take it out of the box as you can see
I like to do so I can draw something on paper
it does annotation forward pin command or pin signature pin male pin notice
oh and comes with a little stand to keep your pin in okay
I'm having to work around it so as you can see nice large tablet
the pin seems a little on the cheap side as far as build quality
I'm in and overrides it and it uses the whole screen is just this one
I said it also disables your second screen temporarily while that program is running
Windows 7 or at least all that mine runs on Windows 7
something is a free open source image editing program and it's really good
if you find that to be easier you can you can do that
but you can make msn open up your email or whatever you want to do
I mean I don't even know of a new computer you can buy
this doesn't by the way you cannot use your finger on this so just the
total the actual unit the actual using area is even smaller than that
let's say you don't want to use this whole big or huge working area
like if you had a program they had like a thicker border
it doesn't bend or anything that I can tell and it works
but it's really not that big of an issue especially considering that a
Wacom is sixty to seventy dollars and this is just not as well
just say fifty bucks to make things simple and it's much much bigger
hello internet world and welcome to my review of the vast king kingpad sa10
10 tablet very kindly sent in free of charge by the manufacturer
it's got an octa-core processor inside three gigabytes of ram and 32 gigabytes of storage
the camera app built in and google chrome for browsing the internet
today I have the m0 610 Pro from artis all a pen
tablet that has customized LEDs to inspire that artist within all of us
you place on your desk connected to your computer you draw on the pent
you can store your pen and all your nibs in here next
that's basically how fast the mouse talks to the actual tablet itself
finally there's a customizable quick dial and we'll cover that in a second
DM 0 610 Pro comes with the P 58 B digital pen
here you're trying to sync this thing up to my different
mapping if you have both the monitors you need to tell the tablet which monitor
settings is where you gonna go to configure your different profiles per application now
the drive will to cycle through them if you open the program
add it into the driver the Android functionality works as it should
you'll use one of the included micro USB or USB c2 USB a converters
I chose SketchBook Pro and you could see it just works
we're just starting to get some line quality tests and what
the artisinal tablet does deliver those three different levels of gradient that
I'm not noticing any lag in the lines and since it's a pen tablet
both of my pencil work and also some shading exercises that
we sort of talked about and that pencil work stuff is really important to me
anybody hasn't heard there's this little issue of a pandemic going on so
I like to point out some of the things I'd like to see improve now
Xperia z2 tablet the successor to Sony's Xperia Z tablet last year
Oh point 25 inches and how minimalistic it really is here on the back
it does do okay with the pictures and the video most tablets
pretty much lag free has a nice 6,000 milliamp battery which lasts very long
there's definitely a little photoshopping going on with those promotional pictures
even looking at a head-on so a specs go for the CPU
it's got that AC Wi-Fi built-in and I did run a test
we'll go full screen with it and make sure we're at 1080p here
over on the fire 10 single core 1402 multi-core 5000 203
we're running when it comes to these easier to run touch base mobile games
it's not as smooth as I was hoping it would be keep in mind
consecutively so this thing is getting a bit hot on the back with that
I can do to make this game run any better so in the end
it's really hard for me to recommend this m16 tablet for pretty much
it does work great for video playback web browsing email viewing and things like that
if you have any questions let me know in the comments below but like always
I know because my galaxy s2 charger is right there and it works
Scott are you you know points and stuff which I could just show you
it's just pretty slow and whatnot when it comes to this he has a little
Android dude running around now by far one of the best qualities about this item
I already told you that I'll show you the camera or quit
it's not very good but there's me holding the phone in front of my face
I'll go ahead and show you a picture that I took with the camera earlier
of course it doesn't show as good as it really is
hey guy that's about as good as it is on the camera
show you how it runs on a game like Minecraft to where it's dynamically changing
now that's a big plus come standard with iHeartRadio as well
seems my tablet had a little slope a check but click on their search
still pretty fast enjoyable and bring up my pages flick off these guys
but this is it this is it you get a Windows
I don't care enter my pin so we can log in and see it
not the fastest processor it's a system-on-a-chip the Intel Bay Trail processor
OneNote this is that this is not some cheap Microsoft Office
so it's a little less convenient than tapping the windows button but it still works
you tried it the classic environment you know mean the desktop or the desktop
what it's got me excited about this is that you can just use a standard
that's really an you can connect a keyboard and mouse to that or like
Logitech receiver and you can dock this to HDMI to a large screen
here's our chat room running in the background all the time
how hard is it those little things there to make that go fullscreen
I'm gonna put it up to the microphone so you can hear
it's got dual speakers coming out of the bottom such a good song
but you're not exactly getting the full bass and look at this
only if don't put a camera in at all what do you do it for
this is gonna look at this watt corner this is scrolling
but you can see it's not a bad looking screen even at an angle
it's it's amazing it's better than the Acer tablet from two years ago that amount
I've got as you can see a bunch of apps going
I have unlimited onedrive storage because I have an office 365 subscription
that's one thing to note if you already have an office
sign into your account your windows account as I did on this tablet
you won't be able to take advantage of the free version of Office
this would be great for a kid or a student also a full size
USB means you can use a keyboard and mouse with it that's great
I should hook it up but I didn't think of that
I mean an Excel spreadsheet at 1280 by 800 on a 7-inch
I could do that these icons No so you just have to
believe it or not about five hours battery life for charge
yeah that's not iPad level but it's good enough $59.99 plus shipping
it comes out under $70 for the win-win book tw7 hundred tablet definitely
there's a regular USB on that's I think around the table
it's thumb typable which is actually makes it particularly useful so
today I will be reviewing the lincei 7-inch Android tablet I found
the seven-inch screen resolution is actually decent other than the charging port
the only other device port is the auxiliary jack for the headphones
I did also notice with the volume all the way up
this tablet will actually still serve its purpose for the specific reason
I bought it which was strictly playing videos for my kids while it drives
uh a new tablet from sam's lab x-a-x-e-n-c-e lbe i think s 7 slab
smell like a brand new tablet and i'm gonna rip it apart here
yep i haven't tried any new helmet in the recent past few years
you have like a bag so you can like put your tablet in there
wow i've never seen that before so you have you can
yeah i'm putting it back in because i'm going to go
i'm at my house right now so um i am going for work
so i'm just gonna put everything back in place the back
wow interesting it looks pretty solid so yeah all right all right guys
so uh i'm just gonna go plug it in to my computer in the office
while this day i might give you a tour of my studio for now
i was expecting like i have to put some battery on and things like that
if it's good then you guys should definitely buy it but i think so far
and if you prefer the smaller grips um then this would be pretty awesome
and i like the bigger grips and it's it's it looks pretty awesome
the box that kept the pen came pretty nice which is uh unbeatable
and the tablet got a really nice and neat um package and it looks expensive
and the way you you work on your line feels very very good
but um you might have to put a little more pressure than usual
and all the packaging and the tablet itself everything looks pretty solid
he's doing some quick environment painting so you can kind of observe it
we're just doing the drawing in the drawing the line drawn the thick and thin
uh the light and dark and all the opacity all the pressure sensitivity
this thing is better than i thought because usually you see
uh some of the tablet comments came out in the market
and you're like ah they're not as you know as good as welcome
you get your back home and your multi-screen window with all of your applications running
why you buy this is for your eyes because it really looking at it
it will tell you if it's too close to your face
of course this is just an estimate it's like an mpg rating for a car
it's almost like a chameleon screen and because there is no color whatsoever
that has been etched into a piece of metal because it's not quite yellow
basically an e-ink device that can't stand the lack of refresh
meaning you have that much more screen real estate than say your cell phone
you're carrying around in your pocket and this does have lcd
it's quick there's no issues with glare of any kind you can see that there
it is very very responsive you do have the ability to pinch and zoom now
of course all of this will come down to the individual application
if you're holding it like that how much can fit on the screen etc
this is exactly what people were waiting for an e-ink type screen
i talked about how to start the process of making a comic so this time
we're gonna break it down to actually beginning the actual drawing for the pages
i can open up and see what i need to do now
many comic artists like to write a full script and write out
try not to spend more than like 30 seconds on each one
one of the biggest things to work on is style consistency
hence why sketching up the pages in big batches can help
each page takes around three to four hours to finish sometimes longer
also keep in mind that readers will only spend about 30 seconds
max on each page while you will spend hours making it
i would also highly recommend planning panels around your speech bubbles
i've considered going back and fixing some of the older pages
speaking of speech bubbles another thing to keep in mind while working on pages
is that while you as an artist may be zoomed in
the speech bubbles big look at how other comic artists online do
it is the m0610 pro graphics tablet it is 10 by 6 inches
it's really really pretty honestly and one of the things that i really like about
the tablet comes with eight express keys and a little style
i think that this tablet is honestly fantastic for you guys
that are new to art and i have a ton of young beginner artists
it's beautiful it's stunning and i highly recommend it the company that sent me
i'm extremely grateful for this company for being so wonderfully patient with me
they might be working on that but it does work on
but i don't know but that's fine by me because i use just computers
thank you so much to artificial for sending me this absolutely stunning tablet again
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth there's also an expandable SD slot up to 64 gigs now
so these are pretty much the cheapest tablet you can get
let's take a look unbox it and see what you get
there's absolutely nothing on the outside of the box to identify it
it doesn't tell you any specs of the actual tablet which is a little worrisome
it's totally plain so super generic a lot of different configurations of this tablet
I guess a European adapter which is no good for me in North America
I was able to just kind of snap it back into place
lets me change the appearance of my tablet and it lets me add these little
we're just gonna check out these settings go from the top right and swipe down
I'm actually using a Bluetooth controller here because I've got it set up
go to about tablet and here we can find all these specific information now
firmware 3.4 kernel and the ROM build is called a star
you need to add it on later or use a third-party market kind of app
so it's great to have it actually come with it now
that's a very low-end tablet but it has decent performance for basic productivity
YouTube videos with friends or try to show people things on this tablet
it really ruins the experience with the washed out kind of blurry picture
ate your brains too now to go over the final stats of the device
you'll notice here that the system storage and internal storage are separate locations
where a clash of clans wasn't able to update because this ran out of space
the tablet comes with the all winner a 33 quad-core processor a 32-bit processor
some unscrupulous sellers have said that it goes over that but it does not so
we're going to look at the battery capacity and health with a handy app
my book get down as low as minus 6 with random spiking during daily use
click on the security tab and scroll down till you find unknown sources
you're just gonna download an apk file and install it and it works like that
I'm going to download it directly to the device now to see notifications
that's where our notification for the download will be coming up
it says root access is unavailable currently but there is a root strategy available
the performance level of this device is best compared to 1st generation tablets
I'd rate this tablet two and a half out of five stars
and you may get stuck with a lesser device than what you paid for
these are the 25 pre-loaded Disney books when my kids were learning to read
one they're amazing books so we went and took a tour of the mall
you can have it autoplay or you can read to yourself
it also comes with different apps that are specifically for kids so
I make him watch YouTube for kids when he does access YouTube
there's just no way so having it prepackaged in this shell
you can see my full written review of this cool tablet on
this probably isn't an issue for some people but it definitely was for me
my computer completely restarted it and it was it was gone but then
I've gotten a couple of really good drawings out of it
it's called the q5 7/2 and it's it's a stylistic series tablet much like the
but it looks as you can see very very similar to the Q 702
it's got a very similar sort of looking design about it in the typical
we've got a great viewing angle which is really essential for tablets now
which is pretty amazing for a tablet that is very lightweight in fact the
there's no as you can see on the back of this
there's no way to actually open this machine up and in fact often times
so if you had a smart card or a single sign-on authentication device
we're also running a 64-bit operating system which is a really brilliant feature
72 is the fan that it doesn't need to run to keep that processor cool
Fujitsu 2 button pen that has a finer tip or another example of that
of course the tablet has the standard Windows 8 handwriting recognition capability
whenever using the pen or touch input however if you leave
let's talk about the software usually when you buy these off of Amazon
Express keys and have various purposes like opening the bamboo dock or switching pages
long it features wireless capability but you will need a battery which
make sure to subscribe so you can see the next time
barb um good job stupid walking on our shelf let's see what
okay so here's the box it comes in and here's what comes in that
and there you have it all out of the box now
it also has an attached pin holder on the side to put your pin
and it's also an upgradeable wireless kit so that you don't have to use this
Wacom site to get that also and as far as pressure goes
I have Photoshop and all that why would I want to buy this product
and that's pretty much how you draw or design things with this
here's here's one thing though but I could've done this with a mouse again
but that's for interview of the bamboo pin and touch create tablet
Chrome for instance here or I can open up you know
applications for instance like powerpoints that will jump into the other screen area and if
I open up another application again and I'll go back to the original one then
I can switch between either the two even on a 7-inch tablet again
just snap your keyboard back and switch back to desktop mode so any questions guys
I'm going to review the legally pac-10 which is an entry-level Android tablet
the seller also gave a free gift a cheap headphone here
so let's take a look at the box of the LeapPad 10
I think these are the loudest speakers that I've had on any smart device
I can feel that when I when I'm scrolling in-between between apps or I'm multitasking
something some apps in the background it actually actually produces choppy video on YouTube
the video quality is what you'd expect from an entry level tablet
SIM card slot slots at the back and single single memory card slot
let me show you what it looks like so to open the slot
and this one's for the memory card so overall as an entry level tablet this
there are some weaknesses here and there some flaws but overall
I hope you found is really useful and please hit the like button
so let's get into it now and see what these tablets are all about now
the price point on these is very reasonable the HD 8 here sells for $89
we're going to start with what these two tablets have in common
they also both have the same exact processor an MT 8 1 6 8
if you want and they can accept cards up to one terabyte they both support
AC wireless to get on your Wi-Fi and all together really nice little tablets here
or whatever you're gonna be fine with the lower-priced 2 gig model
but once you get it placed there you can see that it started charging itself
but it's better than you might think on a low cost tablet
I tend to do my web conferences with my devices in portrait orientation
the device will of course work in either orientation but just note
Awards with it and finally the SD card slot here is on the side
we'll step through a few different things that I tested with these
this is the mobile version of Minecraft running on the low-end HD 8 device
here as you can see it seems to be performing quite nicely
perhaps let's get into it here on the HD 8 at the bottom
I've got to start over again with my game because there wasn't enough
and that's the big difference having three gigs versus two gigs
real quick performance is not spectacular but it is good enough
I think for getting basic web browsing done it does support
I think for media and web browsing for what it is
it's pretty good actually and it might exceed your expectations given the price point now
there are ways to get the official google apps on your Amazon tablet
so if you have the tablet in landscape orientation like so and you place it
we're going to put it back down on the charging pad here again
they both will perform about the same as you saw but again
I think there's some interesting use cases for the plus addition of these Amazon tablets
I am sure you guys are sick of it but it looks pretty nice
okay hmm we'll just look inside on the minim oh so
this spam looks very similar the established one and liking across the same stuff
this thing is kind of like bubbly and can you exact on it
well you know what you can you can drag with it
it is what USB cable looks like this and you can you can plug inside
you can probably not read because my camera isn't that were all now
if you are drag player like me new clip he'll need grip well
I have to kind of look at these and you have to like spin it
I can use it to hang myself oh I can't even kill myself
I am hmm no other tablets can do this well in conclusion
I honestly don't know what these things mean so you have to be the judge
I think people who are getting into this game and would like a cheap tablet
I think this this would be a pretty good choice for them
I think I'm going to give this tablet 715 PP out of time
so thank you for watching and hope you liked it and yes
can you believe it so human kindly kindly if did me this come this
I isn't a super old Wacom Intuos and it doesn't have a screen
the canvas pro is 400 the 400-pound mark on Google Shopping so 400 to 500
this looks very nice so this is what it looks like so far
it's got a protective film on the top and we're gonna peel the leaves off
yes please this is a very minute easy looking first impression so far so good
it's a very nice quality so hot how do I open this
basically but because I have an a Mac I need a lightning cable
because max like to be funny and have all their products in one so
hitch here on cable and I just ordered this of Amazon
the first one they ordered arrived five days later and it was the wrong connection
I'd ordered the lightning bolt one instead of the thunderbolt connection
the screen is on so we can finally get in today's review video
so let's check you out actually haven't tried it at all so I've plugged in
I couldn't do really nice smooth lines and I've noticed already
it doesn't give me a brightness option so I think this is the brightness
I'm guessing it I'm gonna put B and see if that works
so it's clear string again no it's optional and Jose okay apply
E and you can put the Kommandant or whatever you use
which is really really good but these are the ones that
I'm going to sketch something okay so I finished doing that
so it's the same size screen but it's not running for shot on it at
obviously it's not gonna be as good as my 4k 27-inch
it's very handy for just clicking backwards and forwards and setting up your pen
it is slightly lukewarm at the top of my tablet and
it's been on for around about hours so that's not too bad but heavy use
I mean on a budget that might be something to consider is
then the human might be for you if you find of having
the human stats for a 300 to 400 pound so not too bad
I'm not used to doing a review video so bear with me
it's very nice so I will actually continue using this graphics tablet
and that's uh that's actually working uh has been working quite well
hello camera the other thing that i just wanted to mention
so if i had to describe this tablet in a few words
the company are really not messing about when it comes to the tablet itself
it has a fantastic performance in terms of the pen to surface movement
and it's quick to notice a change in the pressure when i'm shading or writing
it has a usb a to a micro usb to charge the tablet
i'd prefer it to be a usbc but we can't please everybody
well it really makes a stand out from the crowd especially at its price
point is that it has pressure sensitivity on its screen not touch sensitivity
and that's what you're getting from this also tab as well now
I took some pictures with it and it is not great quality
if you do that then the line goes where you would expect now
ideally it would work exactly the same in any orientation that's the way my
aside from that the computational power does have its limits again proper expectations
it doesn't have as much power as say the iPad pro
so are you gonna use this for your final professional images
the little elastic band is excellent for keeping your pin in there so
another episode of low cost graphic tablet review unbox first experience
so they wanted to break into that market with this guy
I think that's partly Android a lot of Android devices are like that huh
it also has a 1 gig of ram 16 gigs internal memory
it also has 32 gigs at external microSD card slot on the side
so you can't increase that memory size of 16 gigs isn't enough and then
I often do that if I listen for a long time yeah
it only lasts about six to eight hours of battery life
BGN Wi-Fi now one thing that I did want to focus on is they
I'm good so if I pull up my browser it's awfully two different videos
yeah exactly yeah and then if i pull up a different video i'll pause this
I hate it when ads karaokeing oh I am totally careful
yeah and that's a big drawback of this while it does get loud
so that's definitely a drawback and something that would probably keep me from purchasing it
even though this is brand new this just came out a couple weeks ago
I took earlier today and some I took a five megapixels eight
Oh greenie it's very hard to get any photos and low point for skyping
Oh deke also no physical buttons on there for a home button
yeah and on this 7-inch device on in this day and age
I would expect a much better resolution because the pixel does it's just terrible
cuz you're not gonna use it spend 229 bucks get a nexus 7
it almost gave me a slight headache because of the resolution range looking
yeah even at half the price i would give it a
cash out the little bit of extra money for a nexus 7 or even
the asus has a 7-inch tablet which is the same price
i think in this case lenovo should stick to laptops and it baffles me that
Padre so our resident priest is holding a poker game on Friday night
but you can't right now you could take that Lenovo away
I like it but you know you know time will only tell so
I think you guys will be slightly slightly aware of is depending on
looks kind of good so I mean it's not bad it's not bad a lot
you put that one goes here per four persons but personal preference but pretty bad
I have put out already because I already have a video
if you guys enjoyed make sure you guys like and subscribe to the channel
on the bottom it has those larger top and bottom bezels
there's actually nothing so that is just a free side on the top
c port for charging this tablet comes in at 1.12 pounds or 510 grams
the dual speakers on the bottom are pretty good as well
it has an eight core processor that's clocked in at 1.6 gigahertz has bluetooth 4.2
a 4 000 milliamp battery that they quote at 12 hours of usage
and you're kind of in and out of things quicker overall
it just feels like a little bit better performance on this basking sa8 battery
you can game on this and most games play really smoothly
first i kind of wish that they would slim up these front bezels
maybe you want to do a little bit of gaming on this
that's the logo i feel like i'm gonna all right so yes
the time is like 2024 format we will change that after
it's like it's still like a tower because remember it's touch
what's this one is only so there's like there's nothing to move around
learn book quick settings secure on browser wi-fi manager and youtube youtube youtube
yes so this is all the apps and all that should come with this building
set up the wi-fi so just upload this one or it does sound like that
i'm not properly just checking it so uh so it looks like the like the
the tablet is not updated also so we will first check check update
um next thing we're going to do is we're going to go on to youtube
let's see our new youtuber as you can see the processor on the ebook
our learn book is not so fast like like an ordinary computer
so if that's showing on your thing you need to press subscribe
the the speaker speaker works so let's go ahead and select
oh that that one could be for most because it connected to the keyboard
those videos or quick plays on this channel or or is yeah
i can hear more of that song on the channel at ltv production
there you go so we're gonna go back we're gonna go back back
yes we're gonna see what's in the loan book so automatically sign it
stop it starting so it exited as you can see no cards
it will automatically loads up and you choose what subjects you're doing
i'm guessing this is a textbooks like the main textbooks for those classes forms
so i'm gonna see because there's like there's books like like looks like physics
let's see what we're doing um social interaction so he selects us
it's like that i more using the screen because i wanted to do faster
so it's saying we signed in or our google account or g email gmail
it was nothing so thing that you backed up and so yeah so
the person who set up this computer has chosen to block this site
there is not really so much thing that you can access amazon is awesome
go back we enter chrome and then you can see the giveaway dropping straight
the app store is consist of updates for like see market
it's just update the previous app that is built in with the device
so let's turn let's go on ebook run book uh-huh that this thing was cool
it feels good not wiki and it comes in a case
what is what those two cameras therefore here and here one here
we don't know as yet what's going on with those i guess later on
so yes i i guess this is all so overall empty
what do you rate it from a one a one to ten scale
only so it's not like you could access any other thing for school wise
that's a big minus because google is a important thing when in school
in general i give it a uh a five okay decent
but like as he said the the chrome the google beam block is
what is one of the main throw-offs yes yes because i can
he does a good search engine so yeah so negative five
no i'll change my retained three to three because the width
two is to be a tree because the two is like a
yeah yeah but it's this little and it looks on the car on the car
i look like like a bullet bulletproof case that he's very
i don't know if the back the bucket could come out
i don't think he can come out so when it comes to that
it's super yes so it's not free as we were told

Hey guys! Today I'm going to talk about graphic tablet Gaomon m10k 2018 version
A bag for the tablet 8 extra nibs and remover in the felt pouch
A user manual and card which includes information how to download drivers A hand glove
You just need to make the tablet upside down after changing mode
This tablet has 10 programmed keys which you can program as you want
m10k is 695g in weight, which ensures better portability and mobility
so you won't have to worry about losing power and can work continuously
The matte plastic material is really comfortable when you hold it in your hand
I also want to tell you about the bag for the tablet
It's very important thing if you are going to take your tablet somewhere
A hand glove help you to move your hand easily on the tablet
Using this glove you don’t leave any marks on the tablet
I think I told you about all the important things related to this tablet
I love this product because this tablet is not too expensive and easy to use
You can check all the links of this tablet in the description!
yeah i didn't vlog last week at all but i'm back happy monday
uh i have just made myself a coffee um i yeah
uh if you don't follow me on instagram come find me
um it's done me the world of good though because i feel great
no that's why there was no vlog last week so my to-do list
um and that is lots of ad mini bits orders from the weekend
i don't think there's been many um my shop is really quiet at the minute
30 40 orders in one week which is insane to even say um last week
i do need to do a little bit of prep for those
what um people might think of me for um doing it
i think i'd seen catnip share some um and in the honest truth
um so i honestly i have been looking into like wireless earphones
um so they're here and i'm going to have a look at them
okay oh it just seems to be very easy really old
so there's different uh like sizes for your ears so these things
let's link it lift earphones from the charging case and select studio neo
um let me have a look at the price of them
aren't the other ones like you know which ones i'm talking about
um on my zoom calls and just like i'll just leave them in all day
okay the sun seems to have calmed down a little bit now
so i'm kind of gonna move over a little bit if i can
um it's fine i'll i'll how do i get around that
i don't know i'm just going to pretend it didn't happen
the meeting has been recorded and it is exporting right now
uh earphones going wonderfully i obviously have about two hours until my next zoom call
mini jobs ticked off so the next big job i've got is for the market
i'm i'm i'm still no closer to this being finished my brain hurts
sorry about my nails um from foxy ideas um and this is laura
because it's named it says here it's named after her childhood best friend
so that's lovely a little sticker and a little like postcard
oh my gosh oh jess thank you so much for this
i'm actually going to put some on my laptop so yeah i'm sorry
let's see i just i love when packaging is just so beautiful
so i'm going to show you um some of the things she sent me firstly
i think it's anathar um you can find her on facebook as anathor etsy shop
i think what i'm going to do is i'm going to log off this computer
it's much later and i can tell i've been here all day
if you decide to get some so i am gonna go home now
about what programs i use to animate and how i actually do it
all you need is a drawing program with layers and video editing software
that will give you a free product with your purchase of this tablet
i'd rather finish up re-watching attack on titan gotta catch up for season four
i start with the tip of the head by drawing the rainbow
then in another layer i redraw that rainbow but slightly higher next up
i use black lines and basically ink over the red sketch
after inking every frame i go ahead and color with a fill
add some edgy music to it maybe slap on the background and then boom
my first ever tablet which i got in 2014 was the wacom intervals
i had to move like three times but despite that this tablet restored the moves
just don't drop your pen on hard cement force speaking of pen
the pen was pretty good with its 8192 levels of pressure it
the stylus also came in this very neat felt pouch but for me
choose your delivery options and on the top of add a payment method
feel free to subscribe to me on there and support the future of this channel
it's the time for the cheap tablet from our friends from china
they didn't change out a lot of things and already i found an issue
there's quite some space between the lcd panel and the plastic casing itself
let's put it back in and this is just a freaking nightmare
oh boy okay so the question remains is this thing fake first of all
i couldn't install it whatsoever if i signed loaded or from the store
2080 by 800 with the retailer didn't say that was the resolution of the display
so there's the first lie and look at this 5.1 lollipop
there are differences basically on every level with the android display and the cpu
this is just moment more like it's too good to be true
i must say even for and fake spec and better set prehistoric model
i see it a lot at this time so next up
hello everyone this is graham from unbox tech reviews where today
i'll just start by having a look at the box you can see
it's got the i mei numbers because it's a dual sim designed by me
it's got an 8 000 milliamp battery and the rear camera is 8 megapixels
here you've got your space for your two sim cards and your micro sd card
see what else we get so we've got a 1d card
which i believe is a couple of triple a batteries to get that worker
now streaming directly from the muppet studio switch between the open ups pretty easily
so so and see the pinch and zoom works really well
so you can see it's used 15.66 out of the 64.
see everything runs pretty quick really nice switching between the open ups
i'll ins insert the sim card now just so you can see that
so i'll just quickly jump to that so there you can see
i put some sim cards in there and you can see
sim card slot one vodafone slot two o2 as you can see
picks up the signal really good just as good as my samsung phone
i will include some of the photos in the review at the end
so you can see the the quality that you get from there
you're probably all inspiring artists and tablets are an amazing tool for artists
I decided to do a drawing to test it out and please be gentle
which if you watch my update video you will know that
please excuse the horrendous test whenever thank you it gets a little bit better
which i think is a pretty good price for a display tablet
and set up your tablet to the right settings and button functions
I'll quickly mention a few pros and cons to wrap this up
the size is good for a small but I would probably prefer a bigger one
and means you have it can have it on your lap
hopefully this was helpful to anyone interested in purchasing this tablet
and let's you know about things to consider when purchasing any tablet out there
I'm just gonna put all of my cards out on the table early
I agreed now with all this said I don't plan on pulling any punches here
all they did was give me the tablet and told me to go nuts so
this doesn't mean that you can't buy a stand separately or even make one yourself
most of the back is actually made from a pretty slippery plastic which is why
I just decided to lay this sucker flat down on my counter
there are plenty of people out there that prefer this flat position for their tablet
the good news is there's a funny pokemon riding your neck
the bad news is is that your neck looks like this
the only semi confusing part for some people might be installing the drivers
just visit the website in the instructions and hit download on what you need
no separate power or a need to charge works right out of the box
look good now for a proper showcase and test of what this thing can do
so more about the tablet after taking some time to get used to the display
I did run into a couple of issues for a little bit
a lot of my line art is done with no pressure sensitivity
the two fingered artist glove is made of a fabric that helps reduce friction
the question being is it worth that much for a beginner
if you feel like it could be a worthwhile purchase with your continued artistic development
I say that this is a worthwhile upgrade from a standard non display tablet
no shame if you're a beginner and want to start on a display tablet though
it's really awesome in a very very easy way for me to jump around everybody
how simple it is you just simply grab a hold and with the remarkable pad
there's a replacement in the cap so you simply drop out the new tip
and you're all good to go for another three or four weeks so
so this is my staff meeting folder every Monday morning at 10 o'clock at Matterhorn
we have a staff meeting and by touching this button here and hitting an overview
I can look at all of my notes from the previous staff meetings
I use a broad stroke and I put down the date
so here's the date of January the 27th February the 3rd February the 10th
March the 2nd and so what I do and I'm just going to
I saved this just so I could show you in this demo
here are the items that I want to talk about in today's staff meeting
I don't need to put the client's name because I'm in that notebook
it's really awesome in a very very easy way for me to jump around
I can make it very thick and now I can mark this up
she completely understands if I take this what I just did on here
and then you can make your edits okay in the same vein
which gives us real revenue spendable money of four hundred thousand and then
that is really awesome where you can just use this as an eraser like this
there's another erase feature where you can erase the selection what that means is
another really awesome feature that was on version 1.8 but has been upgraded on version
I'm in a hurry I might even pull over to the side of the road
find the notebook and make all the notes or is like now
I can just jot something down real quickly make a quick sheet
you can make copies within the same folder within the same notebook so for me
some people say it's too expensive quite honestly it's priceless for me
it's all right here in one place so two thumbs up for remarkable 2.0
i try to cheer up but i just feel the same
I'm going to give you guys a review with a Fire HD 8 tablet
of course it's got the 10 or the 1280 by 800 resolution
I am impressed with the overall hardware of this model so for the most part
so that's 189 pixels per inch so I mean it's not too bad
this is the main home screen what it is is essentially your app drawer
you've got the store link so it's the same theme with every different section
here you got your continued watching and you got the recommended
better than the old carousel layout that you used to have
let's go ahead and remove this because kind of annoying removed from home
you can't really do as many customizations as you can like with the regular
if you wanted like a green background we've got the Goodreads integration up there
I'm going to show that in step review to talk about it more
you can also use text-to-speech if you don't have the audiobook downloaded you
it'll play text-to-speech but I don't have any way to do that right now
Amazon video services you can download videos and now that supports the SD card
you can even have the videos on the SD card which is nice
I did notice reading the manual that the SD card does not support audiobooks
so you can't move audio books or ebooks to the SD card
as far as the high-res screens go users have to test out the touch screen
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up this video right here
check that out if you want some additional information thank you guys for watching
I have gone with a Huey um I've used these guys before
there's about 50 pounds to buy this one it's currently a little bit more
because that's what that's when they upgrade they put the battery for you
but let's ignore that that's fine so let's open up and have a look
I rarely use the hotkeys when I'm using one of these tablets
Wacom that I use it work and I've never configured to use I just
it's got a on and off because it's Bluetooth wireless Bluetooth
but yeah this the actual tablet so it's also a nice size
I guess I had to hold it with a tighter grip over time
I know I've seen some people use the pen from up here
I guess time will tell how comfortable is to use but it feels very familiar
I assume they're configurable just like they are on most tablets usually
I'm sure they're handy but I don't tend to use them very much
if you like to keep your pen horizontal depends how you probably tend to work
I tend to like elebrate so just grab it straight out there
I guess not bundling the driver so you have to go to the website download
I can't complain about that doesn't again doesn't feel too cheap at all
so considering the price of the tablet versus some of the more expensive tablets
I think it must only be like an inch or two wider than the Intuos
Pro that I'm using at work but it does feel that much wider
its tool the install so you can configure the sensitivity by quite like the extra
you know the it kind of throws you a little bit
I'm just talking over the recording rather than actually talking while I draw
I use it at all so it's quite happy with that
you got to use the switch on the side to the on and off switch
V into us that you might get so the overall impressions of the tablet
I had some little problems with the older huy on top
the newer drivers just didn't work with the tablet for whatever reason so
I'm quite happy with using it like and as you can see
I mean even though it's a wireless tablet I'm not likely to be carrying around
he'll it'll manage to to operate for a good long time
I mean I've never had a tablet actually break on me so that's good
I think I'd probably give the tablet about an 8 out of 10
being so fluid to go between wireless and connected by the cable
I'm actually really interested to see what huion do over time
because they are getting better with each kind of with each product
Wacom to task and providing a good range of different sizes and different things
and that's that's not something you can complain about for for
we're reviewing the top 10 android tablets for gamers travelers and everyday users
Intel quad core Atom processor and the latest version of Android OS
it does almost everything that an asus or samsung tablet does
it's just a little bit slower all around but it isn't slow overall
and you don't get the prestige of having a name-brand otherwise
you should really check it out using a link beneath the video for the price
you not only get a great 7-inch tablet with a beautiful screen
it's the surprisingly high quality dragon touch 10 inch dual-core tablet
this incredible tablet has a dual-core CPU and a quad-core GPU
you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars on a tablet
number two is the latest Nexus 7 from Google and made by Asus
aside from all the other 7 inches is it's incredible pixel density at over 323
power tablet will get anything done for you and because it's made by
Google it integrates with all of your Google accounts perfectly right
all the information and pricing on these amazing tablets number one is the best
Android tablet that you can currently get it's 7 inches comes in white and black
in fact it only weighs 0.61 pounds and it's only 0.35 inches thick
lets you use it as a universal remote control for your TV
it has built-in cameras that you can use for video chat on
hey everybody its LAN sideburn and we're checking out the RCA cambio today
Target stores here in the United States for about two hundred dollars
so it's got some flexibility as to how you can configure it
the display is certainly passable compared to what we've seen in other places
it isn't too bad the one thing that was interesting about it
nothing happens because there's a divider line here between the left
so you can't do a two-finger click but you can do a two finger
nothing to be excited about but you can take some some decent pictures
I guess but it's not really going to do well as a photographing device
so let's take a look now and see how it performs all right
real quick and see how fast it renders up things on-screen both HTML and video
Adam Bay Trail chips even though they're not the most powerful things in the world
I really do web browsing and video playback quite nicely as you can see here
and it really is a decent experience overall and on the octane benchmark test
a little bit harder to navigate with this less expensive trackpad on here
there right now is not going to run on here very well
wow this is the guy we're gonna be reviewing here the artist 12
I have no idea what's in here so we're gonna find out as we go
well let's see what we got alright so we open up the box here
you've got a contact information if you run into any trouble cute little
Corgi mascot pull this guy out so at first glance it's super compact
oh well that's cool so it actually comes with the stand
we'll probably have to read the instructions on that one twelve months not bad
not if you drop it in a tub of water or anything
I mean the fits not the greatest I definitely like my smudge guard
a lot more but for something that comes free with the tablet
it definitely doesn't feel as nice as the Wacom Cintiq of course it's very light
it doesn't really have any heft to it and the balance is a little funny
nibs pretty long which is not a good or a bad thing just something
they feel like good quality it feels like they care about their product unlike
I didn't want to break it so this part flips out somehow
get it nice and situated here so you guys can see ooh and then
yeah I didn't put hardly any pressure on it and it just kind of collapsed
let's talk about some of the features of this tablet so it features a display
the human hand can't actually differentiate between that many levels of pressure
see how it goes and the pen actually has tilt function which is cool
we'll see how it feels when we actually draw in it ok so now
I'm gonna try and get this tablet to display the same display
I'm gonna press that in to turn it on there we go
we don't even have to do anything to have it display on here
Wacom pens this opposite side would have a pressure sensitivity eraser
we'll see what they do will also open up the driver
which um you know is kind of the biggest deal with these off-brand tablets
let's uh see if there's any pressure sensitivity by default wowie-zowie
LKR oh is that the the wheel function it is ok
but it's saying different modes down at the bottom so right now
it's actually pretty dang accurate just out of the box even on the corners can
so that's pretty cool that's useful just for ease of use
I'm gonna set it back to duplicate display for now that way
that's probably depending on how you like to draw but zero feels very comfortable
I know a lot of artists really like editing the pressure sensitivity on their brushes
you need to either turn it on or turn it off it really
what happens when I click in the wheel can I click it in nope
so if you're doing frame by frame animation that could be useful
we'll just leave it as default for now so cancel and it seems like
let's see if I get a pen and I make it super small parallax wise
is you know it feels portable like this thing is super light
is there a pen that we can do with tilts on it
I guess it is but you have to push down a little bit
I mean of course but that's something you'd have to get used to well
I'm trying to think of a bad thing to say about it
I'm used to drawing pretty tiny so I would be fine with this
another thing to complain about is maybe the pen doesn't feel the greatest
the pen feels fine the nib like I was saying is plastic
it certainly doesn't feel like paper um just for for fun
we can try putting on this anti glare screen on it
some of the pros about it there was no parallax to be seen
and probably my least favorite part about the tablet is its HDMI
only which if you don't have a computer that has an HDMI port
First, let's take a quick look at an overview of the features.
The color gamut is wide, but color accuracy is a bit off.
The pen is very basic and it requires charging before you can use it.
wear out, you have eight replacement nibs hiding inside of the pen stand.
Also, I noticed that double-click doesn't register some of the time.
Instead of being made of mostly plastic, it's made of metal.
I'd be concerned about them breaking or becoming disconnected by accident.
There are not any express keys on the exterior of the Mast 22
There's only a small gap between the tablet edge and the desk.
Once you get extended mode working with the UI scaling set
In regards to the driver quality, the drivers are a bit buggy.
I found that I've had to uninstall and reinstall them on several occasions
just to get the cursor to appear on the correct screen.
22 is an adjustable stand that attaches securely to the tablet.
All right, so that was my review of the Parblo Mast 22 display tablet.

Windows or Mac and you can draw on it using the included pen
there's been a lot of competition and that competition has really improved
and so you have all these companies releasing cheaper pen displays so what
sometimes taking something away it can be a good thing nice
so what are the trade-offs what have they done to bring the price down
Cintiq 16 I have here and compare it to the Cintiq Pro 16
Wacom calls this optical bonding basically what it does is it
so why get this why go with a walk-on for me
the most compelling reason is this this is what comes pro pen too
I've used the pro pen too before on the Cintiq pro 24
I should also mention because I tend to forget cuz it's not a feature
the screen itself looks really good and I really like the 16 inch size
accuracy can you tell me what color you see on this chart
it should be available in the store by the end of the month
so if you wanted to use another stand you could do that too
which lets you attach your power and attach an HDMI cable and your USB cable
I did miss here that I've seen on other tablets are shortcut keys
my script says rewrite that sentence brad oops just be clear
and if you don't like having the loop there you can just pop it out
I do like Wacom software and how their drivers are set up
here you're getting wha comes best pen ever at their lowest
my personal opinion is that the quality of the pen is the main thing
I'm looking for in any drawing tablet and since this does that so well
maybe it's an experiment to see what the market wants either way
thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in a couple of dates
so you're able to draw on the screen in the box
they need to be plugged into a laptop or a computer here
speaking of the pen you get two of them for some reason
the work area is 11.6 inches and it has an anti-glare film applied to it
so there is no gap in between the glass and the screen
this tablet is on the smaller side and is definitely portable here
it is next to my 10.2 ipad as a size comparison on the left
we also have the power button and the display brightness button
but i think it would be nice if they gave you an adapter thankfully
i'm sorry if i'm not and he is around 17 years old
i actually just went with the first oc i found in my email
submissions because i had just posted a gotcha character video at the time
and so i just went through my emails until i found an oc submission
i started by applying the shadows and placed those where i wanted them
when it came to the size i was working at the pressure
also the express keys are very easy to customize and work just fine for me
i don't have a ton of desk space in my room
so the fact that this tablet is so tiny is kind of nice
if you are looking for something less bulky you might want to consider this tablet
so how do i rate my experience with the vk 1200 i give it
the small has a live area of six inches by 3.7 inches
Intuos tablet comes in three colors black pistachio and berry cherry berry
I like the extra space that the medium gives me in the last generation
but if you're on a budget it definitely gets the job done
Pro has you wind up reaching one hand over the other hand
it's a little bit awkward since even the medium is really thin and compact
I was a little bit worried when I first pulled it out of the package
I thought it might be too light and slide around on my desk
the battery lasts a surprisingly long amount of time usually if
this is my favorite surface to draw and it just feels right
it almost feels like it has a rubbery edge to it
same with brushes to change opacity and get darker as you apply more pressure
there are no jitters check and if you're traveling with it
you're in luck tucked into the back of the new pen
the pen has a little bit more weight to it than the old pen did
it's still pretty light but I think the old one was a little too light
while you're drawing over here also use it as a mouse
when it comes to setting up the software and the drivers it was very smooth
I've used a lot of third-party devices over the last couple years
it could be a little awkward to draw with things can feel smooshed
usually this requires you to go into the settings and say hey
when I first got everything installed things were a little bit quirky
it's not quite as good but it gets the job done really what
Wacom is usually going for is trying to be the best out there
so you're paying for the quality you're paying for that good
you can choose one of these two programs these small with bluetooth
got a lot of bit of work to do still but that's all
wow and let me show you the back of it assalamualaikum
it's super cool and operating system android 9 pi cpu quad core display
hella baby youtube facebook and also youtube gmail gallery muslim pro messenger go assistant
i don't know why this liking and now i'll show you my games
now i mean i will show you my favorite game shadow
the 2 year warranty is there to ensure if any accidents do happen
it also does come with a stylus that you can use it
I said 800 by 480 resolution screen the viewing angles are ok not the greatest
you may notice about this device as far as the body goes
they've just done a little changes on them one of the things
Augen jente and did not work on the back of the device
if you have problems your power button and your menu button
one of the big differences as far as this device goes to the
they both have 256 megabytes ram they both had two gigabyte of internal flash memory
would you'd like to have on a tablet so that's kind of an issue
I said it has your home button volume up volume down menu back
takes a picture of your screen that's useful for developers but for the everyday person
you just press the button for the apps this is all
so it's gonna be you know on sale for a very cheap price
I obviously can't install any apps so there's a big problem
I was able to put it launcher pro on here before I did that
update and was able to put apps on the device and launcher / work fine
but it's nice to the device at least can handle this so
it's nothing compared of to the to the Samsung Galaxy Tab at you
I don't think it's the perfect device and at that price
comm and this was a review of the Sylvania seven-inch mini tablet
I do have a performance pack and I did have the my old screen
you got the engine start/stop button you got the hazard lights get work
I could see the tablet dope man like I really rock with
I just headed to zero zero for this video but you can change your whatever
I did this this is kind of I write with it
we'll turn it down a little bit so it won't be there loud
works all right woody so you got off just right here
this is just a see if you turn on right here
that's our AC so you got you got off right here this time
it's gonna be hot you couldn't AC AC you gonna start blowing so down here
I don't have heated seats and none at that base job

I'm gonna just play my video so I don't get sue
yes sir yeah yeah they only go as fast as your Wi-Fi man
okay right here let me do this real quick see it's rabbit
I think you got a satellite hookup for TV if I'm not mistaken
I can do without red TV via Wi-Fi so I'd be cool
I'll be using my phone or whatever I got to do
just better get swap out so mine is going to show right now
I don't have my eyes right now but it does show you there
you got the right front and back camera navigation right here
Explorer yeah I want to see yeah I can get on the internet
I never do what you watching but you know Sam I'm on Google with you
I've been is by everything so now we're gonna go to the launcher now
now you know as far as where my background you'd put a background on that
okay so now I look like a regular tablet you see
whatever you got paying down here then is going to show you everything
this is everything you can't really see it on the other on the other launcher
y'all know about show box but that's just everything right there me personally
because it got a reboot bear part of that it might just be a update
I'm doing a review of the who yawn wh1 4:09 tablet
this tablet out by creating a character design from a mood board
now that we have that out of the way let's get started first of all
I'd like to start out by mentioning a little something about the drawing
so I'm gonna do a few sketches and some character exploration
I thought it would be very convenient to have them on the little buttons
I'd have to say my favorite part about using this tablet was sketching
I looked through the entire box and I was like am I crazy
I don't know how long the battery life is on the pin
I used to do it and you know play with the sliders in Photoshop
and it'll bring up the brush settings menu right next to where your cursor is
I not had a certain way of working with my usual tablet
I hope you guys enjoyed watching the speed painting I did using this
thanks for watching and I'll talk to you in the next video bye
everyone welcome back to another video and yes at this point
we have the jumper each book six plus and this is yet another
the tablet and the charging adapter that runs at 12 volts 2 amps
this is a 1080p 11.6 inch IPS panel and on the front
so we don't block your screen when watching your video or reading a document
three fingers are usually out of the way on the front
there's actually no back camera but not like you're gonna be using that anyways
who knows maybe we'll see that in the extra vision on the bottom
have some pretty decent travel distance which actually feels pretty good
so it'll take some time to get used to when typing on this keyboard
that's something like this is missing from a tablet and you can see right here
so let's go ahead and do that all right so at this point
and what do you know it just connected someone just messaged me on
now it shows it is connected but the connection is simply not there
let's see if we can actually run anything here see if we can play anything
4 K obviously is gonna run at full speed and right
although has some pretty good viewing angles and overall it looks pretty good
it's very visible on a black canvas or a black display
basically what I have in my hands here is a tech glass stylus pen now
well it actually works fairly well and it's very responsive which is surprising and
uh strictly the pros and cons first of all the display here overall
it's got a 1080p resolution it's IPS and overall the colors
considering what other tablets can do the only way you can charge
Today we're taking a look at Pioneer's latest tablet all-in-one computer.
A standard base without USB ports, or a wall mounting option.
For information on the Dash T3 tablet, please visit us at POSGuys.com. Thanks!
i'm carlos and uh i have a problem i have a welcome
i don't know if xp pen has any that actually runs its own operating system
what we're going to do is take a look at the outside
then we can take a look at some of the extras
well this comes with a stand that if i wanted to
it's the same what i do like about this stand is this lever
here is very easy to get to even if you have
and there's another connection up at the very top that is for headphones
let's take a look at the other stuff that comes with your xp pen
another thing that they did as far as the stylus goes
one is also hard plastic but i actually found some felt hard felt
i'm assuming it's felt but it's more of a softer more grippy
okay so let me let you in on the little secret with xp pen
xp pen understands that their products are on the affordable side of the spectrum
so if i click the plus button here you see i have quicktime open
chances are that you just need to click that button again
but what it was was i had the eraser instead of the brush
so down here on the left you can set the pressure sensitivity adjustments
let's take a look at drawing in photoshop with an xp pen
at the first generation of this was kind of clunky to be honest
they've they've actually improved the drawing experience quite a bit i am
i bought this one about five years ago for about twelve hundred dollars
1200 brand new 600 or or you can get this one for free
all you have to do is make sure that you're subscribed to my channel
i'm going to pick a random comment out of the comments section of this video
i'll pick a random winner and then i'll send you this guy for free
if you win what i'll do is i'll go to instagram or twitter
and then get your address from there and then i'll take care of the rest
Sonia came out the gate last year at MWC with their vision of a tablet
always a welcome feature of a tablet experience one of the first things
and it makes this one of the thinnest and nimblest tablets
this is a good change from the rigid corners of the original end
backed by the audrina 330 and three gigabytes of RAM provide the sheer power
that really broke my experience or make it tough to get what I needed done
the tablet is able to perform the same noise canceling as the smartphone
within what kind of struck me the most about this tablet was well
cameras on tablets are always a bit tough to give big recommendations to primarily
you won't get anything from this camera that rivals the smartphone
I always say when you keep it simple you keep it fast
Sony's own media market called unlimited and it has a stage along with PlayStation mobile
Xperia z2 tablet for about $550 on online retailers and that is a premium price
but in a way you can argue that you get what you pay for
Sony is entry into the tablet game started over a year ago
Sony TV in your hand with all of the power of the Xperia z2 smartphone
I said I’m done with reviews, and I am, but there is one tablet
The one I drew on almost every day for five years.
When I started an art business I invested in a Wacom Cintiq 27QHD Touch.
Yes these tablets are expensive, but again, this is a business for me.
I wanted a tablet I wouldn’t have to replace for years.
Pro 24, which is what I’ve been using daily ever since.
I had the option to try the 32” Pro but I wanted the 24”.
It’s amazing. My setup makes using the physical keyboard awkward, but that’s my problem.
I could easily bash a hole in the wall with this thing.
And even a mechanically disinclined idiot like me can put this one together.
I had to hack my desk because it didn’t have enough lip.
Oh yeah, don’t try to mount an arm on a piece of cardboard.
Especially with all 16 pounds of sheer animator muscle pushing down on the other end.
My cat jumped on it and the screen didn’t get scratched.
Not that it would do much against these devil claws of justice.
You want to know what drove me nuts about the 27QHD?
For a while I had a Wacom driver where that problem stopped. It was heaven.
Every time. Also interesting: after four years of use the 27QHD got the blues.
You’ll be drawing for two/three hours and then all of a sudden WHHHHHHHHHHRRRRR.
Why is its fan so loud! It won’t simply stay off or on.
Is this a problem with the receiver inside my Cintiq Pro?
Someday I’ll get ticked enough to dismount the tablet and look.
Fingers crossed: my old remote has been working fine without disconnecting for four months now.
Does this happen to anyone else, or is it just me?
Oddly, whenever that box pops up is when the tablet bugs out.
because the preference file itself gets corrupted, so restoring from a backup wouldn’t work.
If I’m having a weird issue, reinstalling the drivers works 95% of the time.
By the way driver nonsense after updates is absolutely not unique to Wacom.
Be sure you can plug what you’re getting into your computer or laptop.
Find out if the tablet works in your drawing program before you buy.
The Cintiq Pro is 4k. Oh yes. Ohhhhh yes. I’m happy.
The Pro pen recognizes 8,000 levels instead of the old beast’s 2,000.
But it came in the box and that’s what I like, okay? Overall impressions.
hello you lovely lot and welcome to a new video today
I've tried so I was very excited to give it a go
I will say so if I don't like it I'll say so
this just allows me to compare each tablet fairly without wondering if any problems
I encounter the problem of the tablet or the computer within the XP pen software
the edges are not beveled which is unusual compared to most of the other tablets
no bells or whistles very plain but I just really liked it
I'm thinking this tablet is probably more made for use with laptops
there is a button on the pen which you can change the function of
this pen is that it doesn't have a battery and it doesn't need recharging
it didn't feel like it was wobbling around whereas with some other cheaper brands
another note is that there's no pen holder either separately or on the tablet itself
it didn't have anything which means you could potentially lose your pen easily again
which as mentioned you can have on either side of the tablet
you can even have the tablet in portrait format if you want
I didn't try that because I don't have the space for it
I found them easy to set up with the appropriate shortcuts
they wanted and I set mine to undo to open the tablet software
I left it on the default sensitivity settings to familiarize myself with them
it doesn't stay clean for long and it does tend to show fingerprints but also
I would say that you might have issues if you have
I ever want to draw or do any video editing on the laptop then
I would definitely recommend this as a tablet for a beginner to digital ah like
it comes with a nice variety of accessories which mean it can be used on
Android phones and tablets and not just your computer and it performed consistently well
the setup was simple and I found no overall hiccups I using it
I can't round off a video without talking about the character
it was digital painting but I feel like I'm learning something new with every attempt
thank you so much for supporting my content and enjoying what
I do hope you enjoyed the video and I will see you in 2020 bye
I can't believe you are a sellout or something and well yes
I thought it would just be something new to do while
I'm working on other things so yeah I guess we'll get on with the review
and that's that's not even a joke so moving on to the actual tablet
I hope that I really need to get like a better camera
okay here we go so onto them onto the actual tablet
I guess I could find a way to like use these I might
we're making black spaghetti and I'm just showing you the curvatures and so far
so yeah it works on the internet and everything else so
what should I draw with my new tablet and what program should I use
Ross painting a picture of Bob Ross painting a sonic OC
that seems a little bit complicated for what we're doing but let's let's move on
Steven universe for we might do that this but don't actually okay draw this
I'm just gonna do this by memory because why not so
everyone knows that a good bore picture always starts with a an enormous circle
this is probably gonna be really sketchy cuz uh mspaint does not have layers
I don't know what I'm going for here but uh just testing out basic functions
I can't be bothered to put too much detail in such a small space
do you think any any other tablet can create such a masterpiece
it was a Wacom Intuos and not that any of that is the point
I personally don't use things like that but I know some artists do
is that the other end of the pen is not usable
I really traveled down this interesting route whole rabbit hole back in the day
2005 like tablets weren't exactly heard of especially drawing tablets in particular
I should say I was very much impressionable at the time because you know
I did notice the fact that being that this is such a small tablet
I guess would be the best word I could think of saying
usually some artists like to draw a lake with short strokes
I'm going to go ahead and completely delete the under sketch that I still have
I was still able to use the tablet even though I do have longer strokes
my lines aren't perfect so this is kind of minor usually
I have it happen a little bit bigger but it leaves gaps of uncolored areas
I definitely do think I like it a little bit more open
and so i zoom in to sort of get all the detail so like
there is a limit but much more than I could with traditional art
guys this tablet that has really thoroughly impressed me for $30.00
the size is a little bit small but but other than that
I want to give a review of the Wacom tablets specifically for photographers
this one's pretty nice and we also have the intuos pro
Wacom one and I had never even heard of this one
it's got four programmable buttons so it makes it really nice to use versus
but the so you can see the difference here but this with a the
I'll think it's much heavier so it has a really good feel to it
I've had no problem at all so this one else has a touch setting
I don't want it to so I've just turned that off it
I think it's mini-usb so it's kind of the older style of connection
I do tend to work in odd places like libraries and stuff at times
I feel like they're pretty much the same weight so they both would work
I think it's like 70 bucks so not something I would do
it's not a really nice thick rubber like their pro one
this one is just kind of like a little bit sticky so
also has two buttons one long one short and a slight texture on them
so this probably won't show up on video but just the feeling of this
I just love using this one and then the Intuos feels pretty nice
so you just click this plus button here to add a specific applications
two options makes it super easy to get around so some settings
I'm in the brush tool you can see here and in the options bar
there's these two icons one here and one here so this one tells
Photoshop that you should change the opacity based upon the pressure
there's nothing too special about it so rather than do that
I just leave both of these on so that it's the pressure
I was going to show you how these tablets work differently
I usually combine this using my TK panel to create luminosity masks
is assigning one of your function buttons to the spacebar so
I forget which one it does and okay so that allows you
whenever you hold down the spacebar it turns into the pan tool
it's just going to zoom to the center of damage so
I don't use that so it's not that great of a feature
maybe there's some other use for it but I haven't found anything yet
it's just a little bit too jerky all right so now
let's talk about what size of tablet we need so all of these that
there will be some exceptions to that but especially if you just have one screen
I've done is I've set it to be just two monitor
and if you have a giant monitor like 30 inches or bigger
I think all right so I hope you guys enjoyed this review
Mouse so I highly recommend one and the Wacom tablets are just awesome quality
any of them that you get are gonna be great so if you like this
hey folks Tyler Allen here illustrator concept artist and instructor today
here's the black artists glove the USB cable the multi-language instruction manual the pen
let yet that just you know innately come with a little case for it
I want to point out here depending on the type of user
it's not going to be popping out and that's a problem
I usually like to do in addition to maybe like the right mouse button
I don't know if it will let me allow it to program at that
rather you know backspace no shift or no no kind of actual function keys
so right now it's set to my first display but what
I can't actually use this like a traditional mousepad when it's on that other display
that's got a lot of thick thickness and angle adjustments to see
I can build things up all these normal settings so this is a brush
it's not functioning so giving the just the technical limitations of a tablet like this
I'm thumb drawing just simple shapes too rough and I'd probably use it
there's just a lot of other tablets on the market that suit my needs better
well if you're on a budget you know it's gonna get you by fine
it's definitely better than a traditional mousepad for sure if you're an Android user
I like to figure out and plan a lot of these lines
I see people playing like Sue Gideon Solid Edge and stuff
Japanese inspired but either way the beauty of it is I will get to
just like every new device the joy 11 gets preceded by a new successor
it now comes with an updated spec sheet and a totally new design
external hard drives this round but these usb ports only work on usb 2.0 speeds
the metal keyboard unfortunately doesn't offer a great typing experience with its flat keys
the trackpad uses windows drivers and it is extremely steep to press on
i suggest that you purchase the ladder keyboard cover instead of the metal keyboard
and that is if you can do away with two full-size usb ports performance wise
the joy 11 delivers 5 hours of continuous use just like its predecessor
it is priced at 899 ringgit while its keyboard dock and the joy
Here I am reviewing the Galman and 10k 2018 tablet before we get into this
Mons request if you want to check them out cool cool
let's do it so this is the gal maan em 10 K 2018 graphic tablet
we got a drawstring begi to hide all your secrets go in the sack
we're gonna poke at the side thing and pull out the cord
I'm not gonna open all that I'm just I'm gonna put it back
I did get it to work on Photoshop and newer programs
I dropped it down the stairs for science and here guys and it came out
the one thing that really annoyed me was the lack of support for older programs
it didn't even give me the not responding or closing of the program
and we're taking a look at the matrix pad s 30 now
Cheaper tablets don't support for example has an octa-core processor it
can you can actually connect your 5g network instead of just your two point four
then browsing the web is where it's shown it basically was allowed to
if so leave a like and don't forget to subscribe then guys for watching
he sent it over in exchange for reviews over the past week
I highly recommend getting on with the screen if you can afford it anyhow
that lifts a tablet 20 degrees off of any surface on paper
let's start with this tablet excels in my opinion that would be the laminated display
I do wish is that these pens were just a tad on the heavier side
I'm not really keen on putting to use but for what it is
they work as they're supposed to nothing really to mention here
this thing is made completely out of plastic which makes it very easy to carry
I can't say the same however for the stand like I mentioned earlier
USB that goes into an outlet and here is what the finished setup looks like
12 Pro the laminated screen is easy to draw on the button and dial interface
I can say with the clean conscience that I recommend buying this tablet
my hope is that this review helped you to make a decision
also a huge thank you to XP Penn for sending this thing over
I look forward to doing more reviews like this one in the future
disclaimer this product was provided to the author to do a review
not those alone to have your product reviewed visit bit that lease
from red water came here today to talk about the 27-inch kids tablet
you know people in my apartment so but you know it will powered by Android
is the cute little loading screen but you get the gist
and even when the tablet is on silent that still goes on and
so if you need to disinfect this and clean it off entirely for your kids
I have elected to use it for myself um you know I mean
I've played with a few other tablets made for kids before
sometimes they're a little laggy because it's not like they're very hydrate
its own even with all of the fun games on it oh
just the last thing is that the battery life is about
I don't know I don't know if it was just like a weird lit
accordingly some other ones are ABC world basically learning your ABCs
there's no kid stand or anything that it comes with but it does
it's easy to hold this grip you know like even if
you can just simply take it off and just you know
you have to do all this complicated steps to get out of the child
lock in order to access the rest of the tablet so I can confirm by
I was locking myself out of all the other apps that it works
what i didn't expect was a little bag for you to place the tablet in
they threw in a glove and of course it came with the tips
uh definitely wouldn't be the best option for those of you who prefer something light
well the price of this tablet is 75 bucks so you know
it saddens me but at the same time makes me glad
what else can you really explore in short tablet's pretty good
thank you to gaomon for sending me it and i really hope this whole time
oh wait i have one more thing to say about this
i don't know why that bothers me so much but it does okay really now
Oh tip 2 that I received full review from mom central and VTech
I'm showing the cheek today while my little guys in preschool
it'll stay up by itself and you can use it horizontally or vertically
so let's um put his programs just give you a quick overview
George an icon to get started so you can either go to the cartridge
hello so you can little dark in here but yeah so this
aye so he thinks that's pretty cute so then you can
so you can go to your home screen then and take a picture
there's the art studio and you can you do it by hand
you can use your hand or you can use the stylus
hand that closes up and goes right in the case and you turn it off
I want to just tell you this is perfect and little girls
that goes with this on the go so yeah love it love it
hello nick here from technovo and welcome back to the channel today
which has been specifically designed just for kids before we get into it though
one gigabyte of ram 16 gigabyte of on-board storage and a 2 700 milliamp battery
my daughter smashed an ipad before which wasn't great for anyone with this tablet
you get a thick rubber case which protects the tablet from bumps and falls
and if you dropped it on a flat surface like your floor
if the screen got caught on a sharp corner a table
it's nothing special in appearance but the bumper case is nice
the shortest duration to play can be set to five minutes
which apps have been used and when etc which is quite helpful
our apps are available too as i thought they may be unknown rubbish games
we sat there and read a number of stories together with bright colorful pictures
keep the kids entertained as a treat or a reward i like the disney affiliation
i'm in two minds as to whether i want the ability to play video content
that's a wrap on this video if you've stuck around then thank you very much
we're gonna be checking out this little tiny 7 inch laptop or tablet
I want to thank pika girl for sending me over this review unit
it's got almost like a full keyboard that you could type from
it offers to mic ports on the top and speaker ports in front which
like you put on a better or something like that or your lap
it won't even take it only takes up to three amps
you actually have a little slot here that you can stick in your
it does take a little bit of getting used to where the space bar is
it's made for stuff like this so it actually works really well like
it's not hard at all once you get used to it what
I did find a problem was with the right-click it's I mean
this guy has no fans it is virtually quiet the heat you could see
I really like about this guy I gotta say I loved it
this thing works really well in those conditions especially loading up
I'm no stranger to this CPU and also like mini laptops
I have a bunch of them and I'm a huge fan of ultra mobile pcs
this is the GDP win and also the GDP win -
can i play any games on this anything that's 2011 and before probably but
I don't think you would really want to play games on this guy anyway
and you're not really too stressed out about like playing games or anything

XP pen artist 12 pen display a cute little entry-level drawing tablet
I was in no way surprised by this fourth price point
to having a glossy err screen like this is colors do tend to be crisper
there's even a touch slider in the middle of those express keys
it's not quite as sensitive as some of the other touch pads
the default mapping on the brushes at least is backwards for example swiping down
it's their standard stand that they tend to send out with these drawing displays
I've also said this in other videos but I'll say it again closes pretty fast
I am using Photoshop and I do not have the stroke straightener on
sensitivity also has a clickable button along this side it's customizable and also indented
I also found that drawing really lightly with it produces a line
I drew my first line and I got excited because it felt so good
pretty quickly kind of reminded me of drawing on the iPad
so what are the cons of a device like this like
I said before that could be more responsive and the other thing would be
thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in a couple of days
i have said that the uh the glomber pearl arcade stick was 190
it's actually 250 at least or two 90 total with you know shipping and handling
i wanted to clarify that because i made an error in my last video
yeah so i found out that it was at your local walmart
i'm talking about the latest news reviews and previews and tips
yeah no cost to you in the electronics department in walmart at the desk
there will be no display and actual demonstration of how the product works
we're going to go over that you know and that's about it
we've probably uh drawn an anime picture of uh ri uncle from killakil
so you guys can better see and i can see what's going on
maybe i should have come on that side but this thing is crazy
let's let's ease that down slowly ladies and gentlemen feel me
so y'all can see i'll get this out of here this way
okay oh look at that look at that look at that
so let's put that damn when you say that was greatly packed on camera man
yeah i'd agree i would say that was i would say that was great
this thing was a thousand dollars when it first came out
uh oh my god that look animate on the camera man
oh this is just telling you what it already does man
this is a good clock yeah to to wipe your swing off
good thinking on your own stuff check out that you got some buttons
okay and look we got this thing in the back let me put
this is the 20 inch by the way this is the 28
i don't know if you can back order these if you
i figure one is for line and one is for erase
i've been dying quality for the last three or four years
and screw this into the back of that and i think this lifts up
oh that's how i just helped so we flipped this over the back side
you can use it as a second monitor if you want to however
i don't know what those and you guys can leave that in the comments too
oh my god oh you know what this is for duh
leave it in the comments below what it's really for because i have no idea
yeah man it comes they pack this good so you get basically the pin one
they see you give you one and i like that man
i like that because some people don't give you nothing to do
i've seen people draw stuff on here that beyond you know you
i was wondering where the screws were that i ain't gonna even like him man
i know we got some screws somewhere but i wasn't seeing them
you know but sometimes you want to get it in head to head
you'll find out friday evening when we go out there and interview these guys personally
so that's gonna be it for this unboxing when we come back
we've also got an octa-core processor running up to 1.5 gigahertz it's an IPS panel
I won't be talking to you about the cameras in this video
the place where they've saved a lot of money is normally on the screen
normally you buy maybe one of these larger tablets from Amazon or Ebay
I'm not sure how well this will be supported for future upgrades
I really appreciated that what I've really enjoyed though is watching back some videos
and that's purely because the screen is a really nice or color
you've got a nice sort of smooth sort of gradation to the angle on this
we also got microSD card slots you can expand the memory
I think that they've done a really good job on this
if you check out the links down in the video description area you can see
Titan 2 if you're looking for a really large screen Google Android tablet
I really do appreciate it as always if you liked the video
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in another video very soon
So what’s the difference, and why is the S21 priced lower than the S20?
So let’s now have a look at their design, button placement, and ports.
Both models come with 32GB of internal storage, and Bluetooth 5.0 support.
Both models have dual band AC 2.4 + 5 GHz Wi-Fi support.
And both models have the exact number codex and decoders to play HD 1080p videos.
It’s the official version with Chromecast, and here you can see
Here is some sample footage from both models using their rear facing 8MP cameras.
The S21 however is slightly larger than the S20 and cost much less.
So if you’re on a budget the S21 might be the right choice.
And if you’re looking for a budget tablet with slightly better performance and hardware
Thanks goes out the Vankyo for sending these two tablets for review.
Links to both models can be found in the description directly below this video.
Stay tuned and I’ll be seeing you in the next one.
i originally wanted to have a danganronpa speedpaint in between them
as a screenshot of the items you can expect to find inside
it's only 11.6 inches diagonally so it was an adjustment for me
the tablet came with a shiny film over it to protect the screen
the tablet also came with the user manual and the glove
the cords are long enough to be flexible with where they went
there are buttons on the side of the tablet to adjust brightness and color
i believe and the auto button is used to go back in the menu
you'll get a 15 discount on their already marked on price
when i tilt the pen the cursor moves very far away from the nip
i think this tablet is a great option for beginners on a budget
i don't have to move my hand as much to make larger strokes
uh hopefully i'll see you next time with a speed paint bye
um i forgot what i was in the middle of saying
right foreign blue camera a i-66 so i thought 64 security foreign like home
hello everyone its Laurie and welcome back to a new video today
I'm doing a review of the XP pants RG 968 tablet
this tablet has got a surface of 8.30 5x5 point 33 inches
the box includes different quick guides on how to install the driver to your computer
this is just smart phones and tablets which is also pretty cool
it was the first sketch but I really didn't like how it turned out
I did struggle a bit this destroying not with the girl I really like
I yeah or does it look fine how I left it
is that when you connect your tablet to your computer or laptop
it will blink a small white light which is on top of the 4x
press key a few times to know that the tablet is on
I use pencils every day at school or when I draw traditionally so
it's kind of weird too old also because I have to click like the right
I mean I got used to it because I have been using it since December
it has everything that you need and it's very easy to install
it was my first time doing a review of a tablet so
I love you and I'll see you all next time bye
hey everyone today i want to talk to you about the books nova 3 now
we have a lot of different options over to the side including our library
the books reader which is built in is actually pretty good
it's also your notebook so as you can see it has pressure sensitivity
it is the new game-changing laptop tablet hybrid the CF 20 is more in text
CF 20 comes standard with a 10.1 inch anti-reflux anti-glare Full HD screen
but if you need more you can get a digitizer as an option
Intel Core M 5 processor has a full eight gigabytes of RAM
Drive heaters on the new fully rugged CF 20 all ports are protected
the tablet comes standard with the USB 3 port a micro SD port HDMI port
connectivity it does have an option for 4G LTE or dedicated GPS
what's going on guy is the CTA Prime back here again today
we get more screen real estate so if you need a bigger tablet
I would opt in for the 10 inch version inside of the box
all of the ports and buttons are on the upper side of the tablet
I think the closest competitors to these tablets are the Amazon fire branded tablets
that's the only bloat on here so now it's time to test this tablet out
it's gonna open up all of the apps that are pre-installed
I am connected to my 5 gigahertz home network my home
moving over to some GPU benchmarks with 3dmark sling shot all of these
it holds it fine if you're interested in picking one of these controllers up
I also tested out grand theft auto san andreas and they both run great
I got the settings maxed out here using the eye peg of 98 e3
not all games are gonna work great but well optimized games well like rampage
mario kart mario 64 i did test goldeneye at the lowest resolution
but if you want to go with some old stuff like sega genesis
great on this hardware are FD a neogeo game boy game boy color Mega Drive
version is only 15 dollars more than the 8 inch version
you get much more screen here and performance is going to be the same
it is which makes it a lot easier to draw on so
next up we have the M 106 k the professional graphics tablet
ten by six point two five inches area five thousand eighty
so make sure to take that off before you draw this
there's a new interface for the tablet settings in this tab
we have the stylus pen settings my pressure sensitivity is at zero right now
cam can be pretty much any key or any mouse button right now
now let's change this one to tewi for example could take our control make it
II and my shortcuts are e4 erase and B for brush
so I'm not gonna apply and test that okay so II for this on okay
change to the erase tool and I'm gonna tap the one
if you go to the work area tab this will be similar to what
I mentioned in the s 56k with a full area in screen ratio
I'll draw something a little different so what I really like to do
I'm drawing at and instead looking at a screen while I draw is pretty
uh it's kind of like reverting back because that is how
let's make my lips a little bit of color you know
I definitely feel way more accurate with with this pen or with this tablet
yeah that'll definitely make me look pretty tired pretty much as outlined these
I've seen some in my life that look of I've been through some stuff
like the s 56k but it fits easy in a bag
it's still fitting in my backpack with like a laptop and whatever
little shot trouble shot troubleshooted and their customer service is really great
so if you have any problems you can just bring it up to them
this is definitely comparable to the different brands of this size
I personally haven't tried the Wacom Intuos or a lot of the different ones
there's actually just so many competitive brands now which is great
there's just little things here and there that you might not like
it's a thin and light machine that has an Intel Core
and that's for the power adapter speaker and volume buttons and the power button
the most unusual feature of this device yet is the keyboard
but you often wind up with these physical keys behind you here
so my my hands tend to hurt for long periods of typing
so let's see what happens when we go to smaller you notice
what that means is if we want to launch an application now this is what
YouTube looks like this is what little appearing looks like on an 11.6 inch display
I found that every now and again I'll sort of go to this middle ground
you can see some benchmarks at little appearing com not the fastest system
these are the buttons for choosing your paint brushes and other settings and so
I mean a tablet style apps or Windows 8 Store apps on the other hand
I've done some other work on here and an overall performance wise
this is the keyboard especially when you consider the price as I mentioned Dells says
I don't even know what I'm trying to show you here
I feel like it makes more sense to think of it as a laptop
that happens to work as a tablet when you occasionally wanted to
the top lip accommodates the camera in the micro sd slot to the left
we have a usb type-c port which doubles up to charge the max 10 slide
open a plastic flap to reveal the micro sd card reader for additional storage
connectivity is taken care of with the dual band wi-fi 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz
that supports 802.11 ac it also has gps built-in and bluetooth 4.2
it's a similar experience to something you find on a budget smartphone
at least there's a headphone jack or bluetooth to plug in your favorite earpiece
the max10 has a front 5 megapixel camera and an 8 megapixel rear camera
status photos from either cameras are washed out or too dark
the front camera is rated at 480p and the rear camera is 720p
and it is now a year later at the time of this review
i didn't find any performance or heat issues with playing any game in general
the performance is good enough to play most games on the play store
build if you don't want to pay extra for these features
let's see what 60 bucks can really do stick around welcome back to
touch logo looks like this could possibly be speaker and up top
this is a micro SD card slot for up to 128 gigabytes
pi so just to give you an idea about some of the hardware
it's a quad core so 1.5 times 4 got 2 gigabytes of ram ddr3
so get a little bit of information of what you can expect from this device
so the breakdown of the m7 hand or tablet all right
it does have dual and it does work and you know you can make out
that's really low for those of you that know what all these numbers mean
your score is better than 13% of the results from all other devices
so that gives you an idea of where the hardware lies on this device now
the sound is a bit weird on this device like Samba
on some apps you can barely hear what's going on in on other ones
you do have to you know you have to pace yourself
let's see just to show you how long it takes to load see not bad
that's not a really fast tablet but it gets the job done sorry
this is what happens when you point a camera at a screen at least mine
I cannot get the ISO to look really nice but did the best
Google and get the Play Store and that's pretty much it
I don't know seems like a pretty good deal pretty solid
I have a couple dragon touch devices and they've done me well
i'm jason howell and i am here with the samsung galaxy tab 3 8.0
and you can kind of tell if you're a samsung fan at all
be it the phones as well as the tablets they all look very similar
LCD screen that I told you about its 1280 x 800 resolution
so if that's a deal breaker for you you're not going to find it here
which kind of give it a nice little pop still a menu
that's that's going to be sufficient for most needs but I kind of saw it
the camera is almost not even really worth talking about and cameras on tablets
rarely ever amount to much but on here you get what
you know pretty washed out photos unless you're an excellent punchy light
it timeout settings are there is no gesture support on here
so you've got like a little portable computer if you need it
unfortunately uh magnetic charging was not a thing when this tablet came out
so i'll just um just open it up so i can show you guys
this uh detachable keyboard as well um so the trackpad is really good quality
these days are not certainly not as bright as some of the newer samsung phones
um on the exact knits but i think it goes up to about 700 700
um is because it's it's not a 16 by nine um aspect ratio panel
um is because i've actually found no reviews online for for this tablet at all
and that's why i think a lot of people don't know about it
and right which is just just there volume up and down standard headphone jack
there always good the keyboard connector on the bottom and on the right side
uh thunderbolt three uh compatible as well um on the back
i prefer to use it flat to down on the desk like this
i'm a little bit sad that hp hasn't refreshed this line
sometimes it's a little bit a little bit sluggish but it is
it is very thin very very thin laptop sometimes the fan comes on sometimes
the only other thing i'll mention is is battery life so battery
um doesn't um certainly doesn't live up to expectations and um unfortunately yeah it
um it's um it it's all it's all metal and it feels
um i may have other products that uh that i'll be purchasing in the future
10 tablet looks very nice and feels very solid while holding in the hand next
in two different version this is the latest one that has three gigabytes of ram
but right now this model is actually on sale for 15 off
in the middle we have the 8 megapixel camera and in the middle
you have the dragon touch brand and that is pretty much it guys now
you also have another camera built in into the front right here now
the audio of this tablet is not the loudest so actually kind of quiet
right here uh games so let's go ahead and play some angry birds all right
this game has been out for so long i think probably over 10 years now
i didn't know people were still playing it today but obviously they are still playing
oh okay are you on my team or do i shoot you
this guy might shoot me so this guy's pretty sucks too
okay so that's call of duty and this is grand theft auto guys again
even it's been over 10 years now back in the days
there's some flower that's what it looks like on the tablet
that's what it looks like on my camera and again back to the tablet
now let me show you what the front camera look like
if you want so there we have some books as you can see right there
and that's what the book looked like with the front camera of the tablet
so again front camera is not the best camera in the world
but it's there if you want to use it again guys overall
you have a reset hole so just put in like a toothpick or like earring
i believe i have shown you pretty much everything that this tablet can do
this is a new product from xp pen and the price is 59.9
he's a good friend of mine that sent me this product for review
let's flip over the box and look at the specs of the tablet
it has a 10 times 6.3 inches of active drawing area
alright a standard warranty card here and some standard installation instruction manual
i like this xp pen mouse mascot it gives you the look and feeling of
thank you card and thanks xp pen and a quick guide note
that tells you all the other stuff that you need to know about a tablet
usually there are 10 in most other tablet but this is different
7w if you are using a mac machine choose the mac version of installer
and if you are using the pc windows choose the windows installer
let's proceed to run some tasks with design softwares like photoshop
next i will proceed with the test in clip studio paint
it works great and we proceed with testing it on android
this is the mini piece of graphic tablet with full features
thanks and until then i will see you next time bye
I'm gonna give you guys my review of the Alba 7-inch tablet
if you haven't seen my unboxing video please check it out
it kind of has that same feel on the screen now before
I'm not gonna do that because the cameras are really poor
you shouldn't be doing that the other thing on this screen
how apps for my daughter to learn and I've got Netflix YouTube
not many apps as you can see about five or five apps so
I think it's great and I think this is a great
it is a backfiring speaker right here at the bottom of the device
the screen is not great also but then again the price of fifty pounds
it's not great but it does the job the less okay storage
so you can't go above that but you know nevertheless fifty pounds again
if you're holding it like this you end up blocking it with your hand
you get you get the option on this one and that's it
so it's not to expect on this one for less than 50 pounds so guys
i already unboxed it but just to show the youtube video here
finish with the milagro tag here and on the other side
um storage capacity is usable 0.98 gb and nand flash is 13.64 gb
okay uh it has couple of sensors here uh listed out accelerometer ambient feature
so it's a better and cheap option but i say the display quality is poor
it's taking couple of minutes to load and the screenshot okay
the company says it has hd recorder but it doesn't actually run on hd
so what is the resolution of picture taken because you just verify that
because it'll work at home or on the go this is
3.0 break here for us bug of course from bra for masseuse
we have the instruction manuals as well as a sim removal tool and
we have a back button a home button as well as a recent app
a five megapixel front-facing camera for video conferencing and the display is an IPS panel
we have a microphone and the antenna band all the way at the bottom
and you'll notice that the color representation here are slightly different
that's the color set levels that I like again as I mentioned
Most Wanted is by far one of my favorite games on any mobile device
I was trying to watch a 4k video resolution the maximum
the one thing you want to be aware of obviously is the tablet itself
you don't you're not limited to using the speakers but the speakers are pretty good
obviously the tablets are not intended to be used for cameras
so here's a quick sample of the front-facing camera on the ACS impact again
let's say if you were doing a chat and you were using it
as far as the skin that we're running here this is called
Zen UI and Zen UI is essentially a Seuss's skin over Android 7.0
you're gonna be able to enjoy most content on the say Netflix
I don't know if there's going to be an update to Android 8
but you definitely have the full power of the LTE connection here
and you're pretty much stuck to your local media with this tablet
this is actually pretty fast and it really taps into the full
so it's gotta last you for a long long time enough horsepower to power
so if you're listening to music for instance that will keep playing over here
you're not going to be able to charge it at the same time now
it does support miracast wireless displays so you can hook up a keyboard
show you the on-screen keyboard now when you're running sort of Windows 8 style applications
the keyboard pops up automatically when you're running in desktop mode
it'll hover if you were going to web pages they have drop-down menus
maybe and doing some thumb typing so powerful device inexpensive device decent battery life
you might remember me from such gaumont reviews as the m10k and the pd 1560.
well the good people at galman decided i need to throw more things so now
the first thing you notice about this tablet is that it's massive 21.5
it's going to connect to your computer with both hdmi and usb
i wish they were the actual press buttons and on the back or the side
lay it flat or have it stand up and act as a second screen
i can comfortably make the transition to at the end of the day
it did get a few minor markings but it still works
thank you to galman for sending me this tablet out of the three
hey everyone welcome to this review of the VK 15 drawing tablet
that was sent to me so this are all the things included
this is the QuickStart guide or manual and on this card
the indicator lights are just beside and there are 12 physical shortcut buttons
it feels very solid a bit plasticky and lightweight but solid to side buttons
here that you can customize to any keyboard shortcut c1 or mouse functions
let me show you the driver before we go into the drawing test right now
it's going to appear in system preferences right at the bottom
so this is where you can customize the pressure sensitivity of the pen
and this is where you can choose the laugh and the mode
let's take a look at what you can configure for the commercial cuts
the cursor will slow down so this gives you more control
just did all this and turn up the smoothing to 20% per helps so now
I have the smoothing to 20% and the curves they are smoother
the pressure transition can be a bit abrupt so for example here when
I am transitioning from this thick line to the thin line
let me use the physical chaka button to change the size of the mouse
let's see if there are any issues with pressure transition so right now as Sims
Adobe Illustrator on the Mac there is no pressure sensitivity by default
then fake actually prefer to draw with this compared to using
let's try to thin a thick transition again so once again
so if there's going to be an issue in drawing well
it doesn't work as well compared to other graphics software that
I have shown you in this video the price for this tablet
we're going to do an unboxing of huion hs 610 creative pen tablet
welcome to my new youtube channel to my new studio so today
we have eight nibs so if it's broke you just can change it okay
i can't even listen to that anytime that i ran into somebody
so let's explain you about this software this smart software this huion tablet
so let's see what the software can do and let's start
this is the huion software pen so we see here on the pen
two buttons so this button is like the press keys and tablet
you can use you have a lot of options of graphics softwares
hey the beat go off bye um so do okay guys
don't forget to put subscribe and like and guys 50 likes for the full draw
hey guys and welcome to another episode of quick expert reviews today
Ivanka as a matrix part which reminds me a lot about the Van
Keogh zette 1 matrix but I've reviewed last year and so let's have a look
obviously we've got the tablet and we've got the customer support leaflets
you've got which is always nice and then what let's have a look
then we've got the standard charging cable which I believe is a microUSB
yes it is just to kind of keep the costs low and speaking about costs
let's have a look if there is an actual SIM card slot in here
really the colors are really saturated not overly saturated and pretty decent
we've got a double tap on the power button to jump into the camera
which is handled by obviously an Google Android works really well
it's it's there if you ever want to use it both
obviously the device supports Netflix as well like I said it is a 720p display
movies fingered lasted around like 16 to 18 hours watching when
i really wanted to try out a new company and this sounded so much fun
this tablet works with windows and mac operating systems including android 6.0
i don't know i i don't know i'm glad they included a pen nib sleeve
nib like a few times and so eight just feels like plenty though
i'll tell you how to set the tablet all that some
ever since i got my screen tablet i cannot stop using them
i don't remember ever owning a battery-powered pen but i know they could be heavy
i'd install that as well just in case it interferes with the tablet setup process
and you don't want any of that after plugging the tablet into my laptop
it's not a big deal since you need to download the driver anyway
it's there but it's not the best it could be on the other hand
it just doesn't acknowledge that i'm using pen pressure at all on the client
i just used clip studio paint to test it instead and it worked fine
which is what i kind of was suspecting but i wasn't a hundred percent
one of the main things i wanted to see in this tablet was a pen
so they cater to events they cater to weddings and things like that
cheap and tablet is the sort of thing that's so wonderfully rich and sweet
you only ever really need kind of one piece at a time
this lovely kind of teal color or the ribbon really excited to taste it
it's this lovely kind of golden brown color and up close
I would be able to squish and this is me pressing quite hard on squish
I am for this so I have never tasted sterling tablet before
I said you probably wouldn't need any more than one or two pieces you know
I'm probably gonna eat five and piss off my dentist because it's so good
I'm not saying this because it's been sent to me that
and it's really worth trying especially if you're a sugar freak like me
thank you guys as always for watching if you enjoyed the video
see everything that the notepad pretty much provides and then do a review of it
so we're just going to jump into the unboxing now first thing
so let's see english spanish dutch french italian and i don't know what language is
that's pretty much in the english version so we have a looks like a type
if the towel does not turn on when you get it
wait for one three minutes initial start to enter instruction for for language sentence
now you can enjoy your tablet with following actions using your fingers
let's move this so it does take a while to uh start okay
okay so i'm picking english and so then it asks you australia
currently i'm just showing everything that you do at the beginning
let's try to figure out where the oh that's quite loud
yeah it's okay up here so we're putting the volume all the way to zero
we're just trying to find the where we get all the information
here's all the apps that are included so we have a system calculator
okay even though i turned off the volume is still obviously has to ring there
battery percentage in status bar last full charge nine days ago
i don't like too bright so i'll keep it bright for uh the video see
now yeah the dark theme be hard to see schedule power on off
so everything's turned off and i'm gonna reduce that that's a loud
yes turn a little bit lower not too fond of loud noises
let's see uh location security accounts accessibility screen reader and stuff like that
so that's pretty much everything that's included in the actual device
so we'll test all those aspects of the tablet and then we'll do a review
you're always going to want to play more and more and more
and plus they're also coming off the expansion as well to mention that so
that's gonna you know help the replay value but even with the expansion
we're just going to see and test if the game i downloaded works well
on this day the empire came to bring chaos pain and death
they want to plunder everything in the galaxy to protect our home
so this is a great tablet so far very impressed android
is that the tablet offers where you could insert sd card
so that's one thing i really liked about the tablet um pretty much
i just wish that the i'll show here the sd slot
they don't they're not meant to last long probably two to like five years
um you could see me uh you know using my fingers everything
the cable usd4 wireless connection pen is packed inside the left part of the box
the pad has rubber bases rounded and it has a weight
and it's very pleasing to hold this in your hand also
you have to go to this link and scroll down to find the new tablet
don't forget to create all your own softwares and antivirus programs done pressure test
i know we can actually pull the walking area upside down for left handers
in addition to these buttons the table had 16 expressions on the top
which you touch with pen so here attaches the four keys
it has large working area that is good to drown it as an artist
so were you looking for me or just really for my estate
i wasn't maybe you could see the sunset i stare into each other's eyes
how about that four kings game and if the city never sleeps
I'm gonna be taking a look at the all new on Android 9.0 tablet now
it actually looks like a decent deal inside of the box
we have our volume rocker power button and a pinhole microphone on the top
but we do have that 2 megapixel camera and the cutout for our speaker
it's just a little more vibrant and it gets a bit brighter
we'll do a quick rundown on the specs here and then
it actually looks much better than I thought it would for a 64 dollar tablet
it's actually pretty snappy and down here there is this little
I've been using Pluto TV a lot lately and it works
ET 720 MP two GPU and for the operating system Android 9.0
Pi there was a couple updates when I first booted this up right now
higher is better at the very top we have the on 8
Walmart tablet with a 574 at the bottom fire eight HD with a 585
the on tablet scored a 1741 in the fire eight HD 17 57 now
GPU intensive the on eight actually beat out the fire eight HD
mark ice storm the on scored a 38 12 the fire eight HD 38 42
now if we take a look at all these scores and compare them to newer
Android devices I also went through my house and tested Wi-Fi speed
I'm not a big mobile gamer so I just went to the Google Play
Pluto TV and Kodi if you want to install a Kodi build
it's totally possible on a tablet like this and it works very well
the biggest difference between the two tablets is this 64 dollar tablet runs
it's actually a decent tablet for the 64 dollar price tag
I got the gray one so let's have a gander at the HS 611
the active area gives you plenty of room to draw though
Pro 16 depends quite difficult to knock over but the the hs6 11 well
I didn't need to install any drivers it which was neat
I recognized straight away but there is one glaring problem as you can see
there's no need to worry about screen accuracy at all since you know
it's it's far too sensitive and it's it's just inaccurate for me
I find it gets it more in the way than it's actually useful
the yeah the main novelty and selling point of this tablet is its portability
it is pretty small as you can see in the video there
Sarah is that a cursor there does it work better on that but like yeah
it's it's okay all right and here animate does what it does
best the crashes and corrupts everything so cool never change animate
even though it's as light as a light thing it's incredibly light
but it's still fine still works the stand however or man that stand
it's not bad tablet performance since this is just a graphics tablet
alright if you're into that sort of thing but I still dislike the touch stuff
the bio is too sensitive in and accurate for my own pen performance
five out of five million customization is great for the size of the tablet
values a five out of five from me and tallying up the totals
then this gives the hs6 11 a total score of 8 out of 10
hi guys anna here and welcome back to my channel today
it is finally the time to unbox this creative pen display and see what's inside
that explains everything and how it's connected and where everything goes the wiping cloth
i receive like a small piece like this so i love this
thanks so much guys it really means a lot to me
and if you are using the canvas 13 let me know how you like it
it says you can adjust it from 20 to 50 degrees to your personal preference
you're good or you can use it as a usual pen holder
let's peel off this mask before application that is satisfaction right
it looks super cute definitely so light but i feel like it is very sturdy
this one says connect to the power adapter and voila now
we can test as much as we'd like but to be honest with you
my work is more messy in a way so for me
um i can tell you that i felt very at ease working with it
so the most important ones and flip canvas as well overall
it didn't work at first but then i adjusted something in the pen settings
it really does mean the world to me all your support
This 15.6 Pro has significantly better color quality than its non-Pro counterpart, the pen supports
tilt, there is a scroll wheel, and it comes with a stand.
Now I haven’t tested the 16, but to me the 15.6
The stand is next, part number AC 41 if you need a replacement.
Then pull the flap open more until it locks in place.
Last, plug the other USB cord and the HDMI cords into your computer.
This tablet will not work unless both the USB and HDMI cords are plugged in.
If you have a MAC, use the white adaptor on the HDMI end.
If this happens turn the tablet on, even if you haven’t installed its drivers yet.
Then you will see your missing windows and be able to drag them back.
All that is left is to customize your tablet settings. Double click the desktop icon.
The first thing you want to do is click the Calibrate button.
If you feel like it’s still off, do it again until satisfied.
Now when you press that button the scroll wheel switches to its next setting.
The other side of this window allows you to choose your pen
Once finished, it’s a good idea to save your settings with Export Configuration.
I have, a really good sign it’ll probably work in most free painting software too.
Since I’m so used to tablets that offer very little pen resistance, I was surprised
I think most people will enjoy the resistance versus tablets that have smooth glass surfaces.
Once I got past that activation point the pressure sensitivity was great.
As you can see, no problems getting lots of line width variation.
Same as with other reasonably-priced tablets, there is a little bit of funkiness
on the way the line comes to a tip on fast strokes.
Most artists never use tilt, so it’s not a big deal, but it is there.
This is because the pen still thinks its in eraser mode.
Boom - if eraser mode is active, none of your tools work.
Once in the middle of my testing session the tablet decided
So you might open Photoshop and it disappears because it’s on the monitor that’s off.
You can see all of my tablet reviews at ScribbleKibble.com on the episodes page.
welcome to the unboxing review of the Bosto 16 HD creative stylus display tablet so
you have the all-in-one a multi cable which keeps things simple
felt slipcover the Bosto tablet itself as well as the flat folding desk
it is worth mentioning but online and in some descriptions what
plastic buttons kept around the edge and a second layer underneath that screen
come across another tablet which has taken this particular design option for their buttons
and you will want to have it tilted up to comfortably
onscreen for your line size or opacity instead of just a springy movement
I personally found an error telling me for the wind tab
you can also ensure that the palm rejection kicks in the moment
not quite the final at the time of making this video
the image itself was nice and sharp but even after some adjusting
now the pen itself has essentially no give in the nib
I was actually pleasantly surprised with the Bosto 16 HD creative stylus display
let's take a look and see what all we get in the box
so here is the box that the tablet does come in
the brightness is turned up to the maximum level right here
and it's not the brightest display ever but it's certainly not dim
so that will look really good and overall this big nice
we are getting a 5 megapixel front facing camera on the left side here
as you'd imagine there's also no fingerprint sensor or anything like that now
there's nothing and then on the reverse side we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
we have the microphone with a slot for the microSD card and SIM card
we have the USB C port for charging and data transfer
I think you're gonna be very satisfied in general with how everything works videos
so that's definitely very awesome and really for a tablet in this price range
I feel like this does over-deliver in both speaker quality and video quality
so it's definitely a really solid media consumption device so who is this good for
this tablet is a good option also since it does feature the Helio P 70
Fortnight will not work on here because Fortnight requires particular qualcomm processors but pubsey mobile
today we have another special guest say hi to gyawan m12 20
there you'll be able to get access to my animation process
sneak peeks and just other cool stuff link will be in description now
i don't know what it's for with nibs inside a glove instructions
if you click these two buttons you can undo and review pretty cool
only this will be probably more convenient for a left-handed person
let's head on over to my quotation marks computer from my last review
and you just get everything you would get from a simple drawing tablet now
but if you're drawing on an android device you can only draw vertically
so if you're looking for a drawing tablet i would i would recommend this
you have like express keys only one thing keep in mind express keys
I know you guys mock the way I say H instead of H well
this is a review of having use this device for about four or five hours
so if you're looking for someone who has used it for years unfortunately
H 950 P tablet has a working area of eight point
I keep making mistakes as we'll get to in this review and new
I haven't needed to warm up to the use of a pad tablet
I can use a pad tablet where you look at the screen
this was the first time where that didn't need to happen
sometimes people like to draw from the elbow or the shoulder
it should be a really easy addition just to a driver
update put a double click in there for the love of God
it's it's a somewhere in the middle if you like it
I didn't expect this to be a device that actually blew me away
you should get this if you're a beginner and you want to get a tablet
you bring the keyboard you bring the stand and of course you bring the charger
this was a real pleasant surprise for me whether you're a beginner
who is looking for their entry into digital art and animation
I haven't sort of experienced then something so small and affordable yet especially considering
I hope this video has been useful to you if you have any questions
I'll be able to get to them and let you know my thoughts
there's another video you might enjoy from my channel over there
you can also check out my behind-the-scenes daily vlog channel daily
Jezza that's it for now and until next time I'll see you later
in and a tablet is generally considered as a great content consumption device
you can watch a lot of great movies on the large display
it won't slip out of your hands easily at the bottom
too daredevil season 2 episode 3 stachyose fight sequence looked good on the display
the display of the tablet has a maximum lumens of 390
Beast run too many heavy apps on it and you will see a slowdown
this is still a very thin tablet here that we have from
on the left hand side you do have a lock button
I like the profiles thin but it still gives you a performance now
the kickstand has a mechanism that pops it open and you can lift it up
the keyboard itself is one of the areas that it will
you've got many varying degrees of viewing using the ThinkPad x1 tablet now the keyboard
whatever the case may be and also using the stylus that comes with it
no but the thing had x1 tablet I definitely recommend it
don't forget to like and share this video favorite this video
Which is kind of expensive, and a lot of people can't afford that.
If companies can organize well, then I am a happy customer.
And you can draw on top of it, and the image shows on the screen.
Also Wacom sent me a stand that comes with the Cintiq, but is sold separately.
So, we're gonna take a minute real quick to set that up.
You plug that in, and you put your pen, and it holds your pen.
Oh, I totally missed this, but the stand also comes with these two edge guards.
The most important thing I look for with tablets is the response rate.
Every product is gonna have some sort of a small lag with response rate.
If I can get close to the one-to-one ratio, then I'm a satisfied customer.
I just learned that there are extra nibs inside this thing.
I'm just gonna keep refining this real quick, and I'll check back soon.
Welcome back, and here's the progress of the piece of Sloan so far.
I hope you enjoyed the new character from my book, Nima.
You can see the final piece on my social, at RossDraws.
Even in broad sunlight, I was able to work because it has an anti-glare film.
My only real complaint, is that the price of the stand is $80.
If you're on a budget that can be kind of pricey.
I think it's a fantastic option and you can't go wrong.
But the good news is, we have a Cintiq 16 to give away.
If you were on a deserted island, what three things would you bring?
I'll also sign and draw on the box too, so good luck.

this will be my first tablet review and this tablet was sent by
I already own busted because I want to install the tablet driver thing
Samia and Mohandas is Kate or drawing tablet and I'm going to repeat this
because in this contributors we use centimeters but is 10 and 6 point or inches
and it's pretty large and the price of this is less than $100
it's really good compared to the other tablets and their prices
it's better than I thought and it's definitely a great upgrade
right here for 4x6 inch tablet which is still my favorite daily used graphic tablet
something there's one is 250 but seriously you know what don't look at the numbers
yeah but it doesn't feel very plastic to me anymore like
that doesn't need battery but I don't know what this hole is for
so the tablet is so this is the react a 15
hey it's just another tablet but no there's a big improvement here
this surface is wider and narrower than those of the more traditional looking tablet
and there's also a touch pad and this touch pad is not a trackpad
okay which is very good and overall the size and the slimness okay of this
the thickness is very slim very lightweight compared to all the tablets
I don't even need the keyboard usually with the small tablet
if you have this you can also use this pen with this one
I have like three V a crane and I cannot always uninstall install
you know just to test right okay so this is really good
so but this one doesn't have that problem so they definitely kind of tweak
which is the opposite of 10 bottom right hand side button
I can move around and I click this button for the brush again
always want to fill fill like this okay and then of course
I will have an other video like really just drawing some art directly drawing
you're not talking but here I want to like just tell you okay
the overall experience after playing with this for a week or so
this is definitely worth your time taking a look at this and especially the size
the first favorite one it's a small one because I use it every day
also the new pen feels great in hand compared to the old one they design
so that's it for the day and hope you liked the review
is it affordable all those questions and more will be answered
guys asking about what tablets would be good to get and honestly
i can give better answers to those questions for you guys now first off
that gives you all the information that you need to set up the tablet
the plugs needed to connect it to your computer some fancy hand pans
fit into my workspace very nicely and installing the drivers needed was also very simple
luckily i have a stand that i already use for my ipad
i didn't have to adjust it at all so i tested
it was easy to use and set up and higher quality professional grade
i hope you enjoyed this little extra video and like i said
I thought today we could open this, see all the features.
Let's see what it looks like, right out of the box.
Oh look, it comes with a glove! And there's also a warranty, hopefully 100 years.
You know, kind of your standard touch strip that comes with most tablets these days.
So you see that shine right here, and look what it does.
So we have this stand as well and let's see how this works.
Whoa! So there's this little knob right here where you can click and hold.
I thought we'd try to finish it and refine it and polish it.
Of course, let's put on our glove that came with the tablet.
Yeah, you can definitely feel that sensitivity. For sure. Ooo look at that eye guys!
I hope you enjoyed watching me paint and playing with the features.
is the home tablet that I use and this is the Artist 12.
You know, I had to stop filming and try to figure everything out.
that caught me by surprise was how accurate the colors were.

Soon I'll make a giveaway post where you can learn all about how to win.
Good luck and remember, every day, is a color dodge day.
I've been scented by gearbest and all the links are in the description
inch screen hence 2150 1920 by 1080 it cost 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
so all the normal stuff you'd expect and it's actually a nice vivid monitor
I don't like clogging up my C Drive but it's not really a big deal
so the most up-to-date driver that's kind of in beta since
Krita Photoshop and blender and I'll show you some work from that in a second
I'm used to the Wacom which is a nicer comfier screen
that's not really a problem especially in the middle of the screen
you sort of wonder whether they're kind of built in the same factory or something
Salling critter the Wacom is supposed to boast something like 8000 levels of pressure sensitivity
very basic stuff pretty rubbish to be honest but you can see
there's a 19-inch one as well for 280 pounds which is fantastic
it's also make some brands reduced or even in their tablet series protection
the weight is quite liked for a 10-inch tablets which is only 393 crumbs
the result is the screen display of the Xperia z4 tablet is very sharp
the color character is also quite vivid typical of Sony's flagship offer for screen quality
read the article social media activities especially watching video and gaming everything feels more fun
yes because of our activities from social media ill enjoying multimedia content

your wrist and there are 10 physical shortcut buttons on the side
sensitive scroll wheel here and in the middle of the screw wheel
there is a button a function switch and five at the bottom now
they can be customized to any keyboard shortcut and the button presses
i've just connected my tablet to this laptop which is running mac os
you are not able to plot points on the pressure curve
brush if you want to assign your own specific keyboard shortcut
just click on any of the buttons and enter your shortcuts here
and if you are left handed you can change the orientation here to 180 degrees
you can't just turn it around and insert it one issue
this drawing app that i'm using this is midi bank paint pro
but now it's working fine again so i'm not sure what's wrong
it's quite smooth with the pen but still provides a good enough control
i want them to so the line quality the line behavior
the performance is basically what you are looking at right now tube sensitivity works great
the shape of the cursor will follow the direction of the pen
be like this where it's horizontal so that i can like this
so let me just draw this when i draw like this
you get this rectangle so if you turn the phone horizontally
it's going to be mapping vertical drawing area to a horizontal area
and now i have this samsung tablet connected to the gaomon tablet
now when i am drawing on the tablet this time i can see
the build quality of the tablet is relatively good compared to other brands
anyway you can check out more reviews for the gaomon m10k pro on amazon
this review is aimed at anyone planning to invest in a professional and high quality
pen tablet for photo and video editing retouching illustration digital art or graphic design
Express keys while the larger sizes all have eight of them
the vacuum prepend 2 is a battery free stylus which is charged electromagnetically
I never really felt like they are getting in the way while
Control lives up to my expectations of it being the highest quality pen tablet
it requires if you are looking for a cheaper but similar option

Next to the next to the Express keys now they can be customized

And if you open up this holder it actually contains all of the different
The interest for tablet senses which nib you are using in the tablet
This has been my review of the Wacom intuos For graphics tablet
it supports topped with an integrated pen that fits into the display
the app the Army's in here is fresh paint and as you can see
there's the 2 megapixel 1080p front face and webcam with a 5 megapixel
which i think is pretty standard there has HD audio of DTS sound
I'm using the power keyboard and it gets its name from its secondary battery
I was expecting something all plastic and very cheap feeling with a lousy display
this is running with an atom sherry trail x5v 8300 processor
and because this was bought from the Microsoft Store this is a signature PC
I did find though when I took it out of the boxes
you just have your power switch and your volume rocker on the bottom
okay not fantastic but good enough for the price point on the top here
I think you'll get seven hours out of there without too many issues
it looks like there's a frost or something over the lens
I did clean it before I uploaded those pictures there for you to see so
that can connect up via bluetooth that also works with a dongle
one thing to note on the accessories you might buy for this
this is running at about 15 to 20 frames per second
League can run on it so I've got rocket league running here on the tablet
some of the newer indie titles of 2d games like shovel knight typically work
so that's a good thing it doesn't do as well with the higher-end
I think with the Amazon tablets that are about this price
so if you're looking for a cheap tablet and understand what you're getting into here
this channel is brought to you by my patreon supporters including gold-level supporter
I want to thank Huion India for sending me this tablet for review.
it didn't feel anything which is less than a premium packaging.
it felt good in my hand and is battery frigging free.
I clearly don't leave a chance to ask for a subscription right
standard of 8192 - pressure levels and 60 degrees tilt functionality
or maybe even the larger size would be portable for you
the tablet felt really premium and has a great finish on its overall body
the tablet is pretty slim and this is where the USB C port is.
here is a comparison to how the tablet compared to my old at 16 pro
these keys won't need much force so it is bound to accidentally get tapped
wow that was a really lame joke as I have said the response felt rock-solid
Photoshop even ZBrush felt really nice and smooth with great response
a pen tablet is quite huge is quite massive for an average consumer like me
I had said that I will tell you what these things do
it was autodesk sketch and start sketching on the phone or a tablet
I would always see a pointer which I tried to sketch on the phone
some would definitely prefer the form and some latter but on the node nine
leave a like if you like my efforts on this video
if you have questions you can also reach out to who you on
they will always support you no matter if you buy the product or not
that's what my personal experience has been so far with them.
but they did manage to shave a little weight off of it
I have with the tablet is just is it's quite heavy
it's like 20-25 percent heavier than like the iPad Mini and Samsung Galaxy Tab 8
so it's a bit heavy but the screen does look pretty good
we've got the power button and the volume and the headphone jacks
over these $49 fire tablet and it also has 1.5 gigabytes of RAM
I don't have any problem with that as the fun rear cameras
we'll talk about the software a bit here so usual fire
I mean it's one of the dimmest tablets I've ever seen quite frankly
that's probably how they get to twelve out of our battery life
I'm using for screen recording right now and it works quite well
I'm recording that separately so yeah you can install the Google Play Store
you can check the e-book reader blog or my youtube channel
Amazon's app store so you got both about the best worlds and amazon
you got their music apps you got their videos so if you have
so you don't even have to pay for that if you have
you can actually download them if you want to view them offline
so just you can do these different flashcard decks and set this up
more in-depth if you want to check that out but it is an interesting feature
so there's those different themes a lot of people like the black background
your text is a lot bigger easier to read so some definitely definite
there's also some other accessibility features in here so device options
there's like a voice screen reader thing that reads over the screens
I'm going to go ahead and wrap up this review right here
p20 hd tablet 10 inch tablet full hd on a budget price
i'm gonna leave a link down below so you guys can check it out
i'll try to get a discount coupon for you as well so guys
so this is what we are presented with for a budget
yeah let's put it to the side for now moving on
it comes with the usb type-c charging cable also included in the box
i do believe them but it does feel a bit plastic
let me turn this around so you can see it better headphone jack there
you got the camera power button then volume rocker made of plastic
got nothing and on the top alongside with the headphone jack
we are presented with the teclast logo powered by android in this case android 10.
this is how the tablet will look like not much things pre-installed
you can decide what to install later on looking at the settings here
10. storage wise from factory so 64 gigs version in the system using nine gigs
hopefully you guys can see it on camera so you have the night light
then it will dim the screen more of a yellow tint
it's nice you can change the brightness directly there on netflix
hey guys the colors look look good they look alright vibrant the sound
you can still watching that while you're doing some other stuff
it is what it is for those who want to know the benchmark scores there
if you like this video if you enjoy it click the like button and guys
I do notice some people talk about having space on the desk
I'm used to because of the wet on and it's got two buttons
it's not battery-powered so you don't have to plug it in or anything like that
GXP pen and wax on and now peak there as well
I don't really notice much difference between this and a wheel to be honest
I notice it really goes fast suddenly when I'm increasing my brush size or not
it's absolutely fine and you can just brush across no problems
I change the color and went out of the window and back in it
I seem to find those sort of problems with every driver even whack on
it seems to be one of those things where you're always going to get issues
the nice thing was that when you go onto their driver side which
maybe it is a touch more responsive than other ones pressure
sensitivity is all that you'd expect which is very good again
this particular tablet sells for only 121 us dollars which is about 105 euros
we're actually getting quite a lot when you look at this particular model here
you can see left and right aren't bad top and bottom
it does of course support microphones so you can place voice calls with it now
the resolution is 1920 by 1200 and we have a very good maximum brightness
it doesn't work for the first quarter the slider until about here
there's a little tiny bit of leakage or dimmer pixels on the edges
it's only when you're looking at a constant white or bright image
you may notice a little bit but for the price i mean
this tablet comes with android 10 and it has a may security patch level
now don't ever expect to see an update from audio cube
there is an app store here too and this performance is quite smooth
why because you can get rid of this ugly widget right here so down here
they've got the google search and you can't actually get rid of this
and that's the apps to start with that we get minus mobile
so it's just the google bloat that we have on here
one search that means netflix is going to be in just standard definition amazon
that that when you install things okay it might take a little bit longer
you just need to lower settings and be prepared for the additional little stutter
here and there with the gpu's performance being quite low geekbench five score again
low low end tablet to be expected and the wireless performance isn't actually too bad
i'll just skip back here a little bit just to show you how it performs
and we've got the phone dialer so you can place voice calls
that's here and then the loudspeakers in a basic speakerphone mode call
so that is good now the quality out of the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
it's just the way the screen is coming through in person
so here's the front facing camera and the audio you're listening to
is that single mono mic on the front so for skype video calls
or maybe whatsapp calls and things like that and this is okay quality
your phone will have a much much better camera than these ones
i won't even bother showing you the rare three megapixel camera
and at least we do have one in this tablet so there we go
i think for the price that this really cannot be beaten
that is really unheard of normally for the budget tablets running android
but we've got that option like the option of fm radio as well
i think this so far has to be one of the best
now you know everything that is to know about the iplay20 here
i never had a tablet that was like colored before when i first opened it
uh and i actually bought replacement nibs not realizing they were stored inside
so that's actually very clever that they have little instructions right on there
it also comes with the usb cord and two little extra adapters
it also came with little wipes and a quick start guide
this was really fun to unbox but my first concern was that pen
i shouldn't be knocking these around but like i have three cats
i used clip studio and i was able to start drawing right away
my first concern was that the canvas size would be a little small
i didn't have any issues with it and i really didn't miss those extra inches
products and a lot of their pens have erasers on the top
because i'm so used to having that eraser on my stylus and yes i did
try to flip my stylus like 80 times before i remember that
and then you have to put it down and grab a kneaded eraser
another thing that i felt like is worth mentioning at no point while drawing this
i think it's a really solid tablet especially for 80 bucks
it's an affiliate link and i will get some money if you use it
but i think it's really important to be upfront and transparent about all that stuff
they're from my short comic far away which is available on gumroad
that's it for me but until next time chase your dreams peace
70 is in this and it's a lot faster especially in terms of GPU performance
it's a pleasant surprise for this model and we've also got of course
GPS but no hardware compass four gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage
you can see there about a thumbnail the width of them down the bottom
I still have the protector on here because I don't want to get
now this does sound good to me the quality no complaints
this is again plastic but the quality of it does seem okay
maybe than most at five hundred and forty six grams okay
the scrolling performance here in Chrome could definitely be better now
it's just a little too bright so it does strain my eyes there we go
install that and then you can dim it down to acceptable levels
so there's no mirror vision application that we normally use to tweak
we're not seeing a blue tint on the whites at least with my screen here
I'll quickly show you the gamma so gamma is off okay
there is an over-the-air update system but I wanted to make it clear
we're on there and this is the free storage you get
here you can adjust the font size and the display size
there's a standard Android settings there but unfortunately as mentioned no controls for white balance
and this is the internal storage so we're seeing relatively good speeds here this is
so you can see and to two scores 141,000 not bad
Pro there it's because I restored a Google backup but trust me
this is this particular unit that I did run and - - on ok
sorry so to skip that and all your on to better life
now this is the area where it is actually excelling this tablet
I've got nine hours 37 minutes I'm still at 30% so this is really good
it really depends on the audio source on how loud they're gonna be
these speakers are very loud with some audio not so much
I'm using Google Play Books and it does look pretty good
let's see if I can just get this guy right here
there is up against the shotgun and I managed to take him down
so you got a playable flame-red here it's not the fastest
so this is a sample from the front-facing camera as you can see
the quality is below average and not amazing the mic as well
we being recorded on the tablet as well now the rear cameras
no it'll last two days three days and you're gonna look at about screen-on times
so there's some improvements coming but the screen is a downgrade
it is really quite bothersome to just keep having to do this all the time
I feel the screen doesn't have white balance calibration for us me
but you expect that so if you bought this to watch
so if you're in a budget this tablet does offer a lot
where your phone gets only 1 bar or 2 bar signal strength
and oh my god they get the award for most evolving design the first gen
I'm one of those two when I use it for note-taking it's OK for art
gen is the thing now but finally no more the core a more core
you serious you can get the i5 or the i7 inside of here
so that's a lot of stuff to change and it's for the better
it's just a regular a Energizer battery that it comes with so anyway
two buttons on the pen no eraser on the end 4096 level of pressure sensitivity
you'd be talking to fine about just the tablet by itself
so it is very thin for a tablet of this size
1.96 pounds you can see the metric stuff on screen just for the tablet alone
so hey it's a magnesium and aluminum casing and yes it does feel sorry
it does as well as you would expect anything with this particular
there is a fan inside which would be normal for you series
I still prefer Wacom AES latest generation a bit more than the entering
just feeling really very nice and the palm rejection being a little bit better
so why buy this instead of the think they had x1 yoga
this is a way to get a three by two aspect ratio high quality display
this one is a lot more rigid in fact they've reinforced it
it looks almost exactly the same in terms of the connector design there also
that keyboard is a little bit more durable instead of that
Alcantara stuff which you know can get a little bit nastier natty looking
do you see that on tablets but service pros certainly has it
you do get a fingerprint scanner on the bezel though so reports
and it's versatile so there's no more modular design the modular accessories
you get the idea you do have a headphone jack and there is a micro
that's that's a pretty high bar there in terms of color saturation
life is just so-so it has a 42 watt hour battery
it gets the award for most evolved to tablet in just three generations
you know usually when we review laptops each generation is just CPU improvement a little
the core speeds going on this is not much throttling going on
the display is lovely on this is certainly a good surface
yeah that's the other selling point obviously it's a ThinkPad keyboard right with the track
Thunderbolt three ports it's great to have Thunderbolt rebut right out of the box
hi guys i'm vero and in today's video i'm going to talk about this pan
not this display tablet but you can win this tablet which is perfect for beginners
let's display a tablet as eight shortcuts and I love shortcuts
it has a battery free pen with 8192 pressure sensitivity levels the precious senseability sensibility
control this tablet has overall a very narrow and elongated shape
so it's good for portability if you if you move around a lot
which is what you want to avoid annoying reflection and glares on the glass
tell all the other drivers from the other tablets from a computer to use this
this tablet unfortunately didn't work on my eight years old computer
I feel blessed every time I can export a video correctly
before or it's just like it didn't know digital art anymore in general maybe
it sort of feels like a meme like you know what is the tape mean
lazy artist five million mistakes liquify so yeah after a while
I just tore it up and try to finish it as soon as possible
it's I just got used to it now so I do like it more now
any other thing feels a little bit weird but it doesn't mean that it's bad
you get much more versatility so it depends on what you do now
you're probably also wondering in which way this come on display tablet
the fact is that on a 900 euros device was almost a thousand
you will get the same exact results and the same experience
thank you so much for watching guys and see you next time by the way
let me know what you're thinking about it see you next time by
so first we're going to go ahead and see what you get inside the box
then we'll go ahead and take a look at the tablet itself now
i'm going to put that off to the side for just a second here
so we'll just peel that off so right off the bat
the tablet does feel like it's premium because the body is made of all aluminum
uh which i always appreciate and it's got that a nice glass front it
you can just kind of take it out and use it right away now
it's very loud but even though it's loud it's very trebley
go ahead and play a youtube video so this is in 1080p
i'm going to give you a little sample of what the sound sounds like
it's going to be pretty loud but it's it's pretty much all trouble
if you're in a dark room you can turn it down
uh pretty much all the way and save a lot of battery life okay
so if you want to play asphalt definitely playable on this tablet
okay here we are inside pubg and i have the settings
i found that my hand would obstruct the camera often another thing
then here is some audio and video quality from the front selfie camera
it's just the settings that i had open as you can see
it doesn't have a lot of range but it has a lot of volume picture
i didn't see any issues especially when you're watching videos on youtube and netflix
i hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did give me a thumbs up
i hope you have a great day and i'll see in the next one later
pro drawing tablet this is a review unit that was sent to me from
I'm going to show you the things included in the box
it's exactly the same so these are the items that are included
it comes in two sizes the one that I have here
this is the medium size with a drawing surface area of 11 by 9 inches
this is u.s. 129 dollars at the time of this review
this is the sort of tablet where you have to connect to your computer
you can actually use this as a trackpad to control your mouse
you can control the brightness as well the overall look of the tablet
it actually slopes up to the Express key and this is metal
let's take a look at what you can do with the driver
you are not going to be able to move the cursor on
the two side buttons can be configured to mouse clicks or specific keyboard shortcuts
for you to jump the cursor from one screen to the other
so let me start by testing the hatching lines the initial activation force
so when you apply a very light pressure you can get very thin
I want them to so this is fantastic and now let's draw something now
sizes you can expect this level of performance with other perfect apps so
I'm just going to show you the ones that perform a bit differently overall
I didn't experience a lot of glitch except for Krita on Windows
the pen tip on the drawing surface it has a very nice texture to it
it has just the right amount of friction and pressure sensitivity
this tablet is definitely good enough for line art and also for digital painting
so let me test it out and see how well it performs
I'll need to use this USBC adapter to connect to my phone
it's going to ask you if you want to use this
tablet the bit quality the design and of course the drawing performance
if you want to save some money you can go for the smaller model
c'mon who asked me to do a product review but everything
I think to feel sturdy and durable but also light enough to be portable
hours of non-stop you so you don't need to worry about it
running out powerful quite a while after its first charge okay
a medium interest art from Wacom which I purchased about two years ago the pen
I'll be using the tablet to finish destroying of my OCE luma
I did notice what a tablet was that there was no mouse mode
I did like that as soon as I started using it
it has a bit of friction a bit of drag which gives it the natural
I did find that when I first started using it with Medibank
there were a few lag issues but those into eventually sort themselves out the more
I'm gonna kick this drawing into time-lapse now I'll be back once
I really didn't know where it would be going had to start
apparently it is so we'll keep going at it at one point
if that happens usually the best thing to do is to restart everything
I know for low artists who are students or young and have no money
think this is a pretty good budget choice to go with
there's a link down below in the description to my blog
I really wasn't expecting it since I'm still such a tiny youtube channel channel
I hope this video was helpful and I'll catch you all soon so bye
I've not heard of this brand before so today we're gonna be testing it out
it's an extra monitor that you can plug into your Mac or Windows computer
you can draw directly on the screen using the included pen
there have been a whole bunch of these 15.6 inch display tablets
that's currently not doing that is Wacom Cintiq Pro as of now
we haven't seen that kind of screen trickle down into these budget displays yet but
it's really nice to have a dedicated place to put it
the whole thing is made of a soft rubber flares out at the tops
I'm drawing they are customizable though so you can set them to whatever you want
I'm talking about line quality and that's where I see some problems here
and and what's not like what is like a tablet color and here
if that's the kind of line you're looking for that's a great question
it's not uncommon to accidentally stop short same with fast hatched lines when
I'll often just toggle the stroke straightener off so I can get the lines
so speaking about the pros and the cons of this device overall
begin with this is the first display or any kind of product
it's going to be super interesting and fun and I'm excited so the tablet
the tablet comes in this plastic sleeve for protection is a very thick material
I do like the size of it and it is pretty portable
the way the tablet feels the pen has a really good bounce to it
and that is that the lines don't come up smoothly and so
not because of the tablet though because of my computer so
I'm sorry that it's striated and it might hurt your eyes for a second
I don't know you can just you can see what I'm talking about
it doesn't really have this effect the lines come out smoothly but when
this thing is a pretty big problem but it might not affect to you
sensitivity is amazing so I would recommend it for those features
if you like this video please leave me a thumbs up so
okay for one person to be the boss of everybody huh
because that's not what role was about but you totally just stab
Caesar hi my name is Chris Thalia or crystal and today
2200 tablet damaged out to me recently and a story together and of course
I'm like oh my god I broke it what do I do
that was us but after the 10 minutes everything worked out so smart
I used to stack binders and notebooks to get an incline
Mohini on screen and the surface pro steps compared to all the springs
so it's laminated screen is thinner and allows a more accurate pen stroke
they have a picture showing some of the bigger brands to support so
after going through the process of adjusting the colors it came out much more accurately
the tablet is four hundred and forty dollars so everyone is broke get out
I consider that original four hundred thirty paid over multiple times yeah
I'm thinking about investments so overall my opinion this tablet is it's pretty great
welcome to the world exclusive unboxing of the aqus 70 internet tablet
tab - tab is 650 this is 250 and this is in the
well the only that parkus has made and here is the F cos 43
internet tablet this is a new capacitive internet tablet from F KERS
let's go back here so there is of course a full
I'm going to go on a bunch of websites so you can see and gadget
no okay so there everything is about the iPhone Apple iPhone Facebook
we can see this article learning so right now it's running
that's the guy who signed the contract and lost all his facebook stuff
AC adapter plug but you can also charge with the USB here my co USB
then it's there use the device as a touchpad controller to control
yeah and click then just starts playing an HD TV resumes playing
I just need to click the play button need to turn on the volume
there's no volume on my TV right now but you get the idea
I need to ask them actually how soon and they can set the alarm clock
maybe yeah it's told naps that muted the sound oh yeah
I think it's one of those buggy games need to uninstall
you can go from one thing to the other back to
Facebook I can write what's going on here on my of course 70 dare
so you really get them massively big you get a huge
that looks a lot like an apple charger from a MacBook
the one thing that this tablet does not come with is the HP active pen
that's gonna cost you an extra 80 dollars all right now
processor all the way up to a core i7 1.9 gigahertz processor
GPU for storage it does include MDOT 2 solid state storage
I read like this keyboard and I could truly say that
let's take a closer look at the tablet itself on top
you do have a front facing five megapixel 1080p camera you also get an integrated
VGA IR camera with IR LED emitters that meets the Microsoft
so you're able to log into the tablet easily with your face now
the tablet also supports a mobile broadband module without te and HSPA+ with GPS included
the particular screen you see here is a 3k by 2k
and this camera is an 8 megapixel 1080p camera and on the right hand side
this is just a thin metal going around the side and the back portion
have a couple microphones here and you do have the power button on top here
you do have your front facing right stereo speaker and on the left side here
d3 is 13 inches which is much bigger than the surface
SIM port would be if you ordered your tablet with that configured
the real magic behind the Amazon fire 7 is media consumption
Amazon's device is looked upon with envy by Apple and Microsoft
shopping can also be easily achieved by simply opening the appropriate link to Amazon itself
one problem is the child account interface which is far less usable than the main
UI another is insistence of an internet connection to validate downloads from Amazon
nibs, and if we unscrew this part, inside we’ll find said extra nibs, safely stored.
and what do we want to download; either the drivers or the instructions.
Hit submit and go down the page to find the drivers.
And since it seems it’s become a tradition for me to share a new artwork
click on the empty box and press the key we want to assign.
I almost forgot to mention that back when I first tried it
As you can see customizing the buttons works just the same way.
you barely need to do anything here except for adjusting the active area
so it is proportioned to your monitor, in case you think you need that.
You can also change the position of the tablet if you’re left-handed.
So now let’s try to connect it to an Android device!
On the instructions it is mentioned that if the pen isn’t detected automatically
Cons; on Android mode you can’t use any of the shortcuts and buttons sadly :’)
So after all that stuff let’s make a final test with a speedpaint.
The texture of the surface where we draw isn’t as toothy
or some other brands, it feels a bit more plastic like?
And as I mentioned before all the shortcuts seem to respond perfectly on any program.
The price; the H610 pro v2 costs around 60 euros (80 usd) at the moment.
I can't stress how impressed I am at the pen’s sensitivity.

so so what's in this thing that's cool showing love to um supporters
um this um tablet is really solid like a metal backplate
yep well that's uh very soft sexy oh cool so not only
I'll be using my Mac laptop and I'll be painting a portrait in Photoshop
six two inches wide there are 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
I want to talk about what I really liked about this tablet
it's always nice to have one less cord in my life
I also loved how this tablet came with this pen holder
my favorite part of this tablet though was the dial at first
I didn't have to work as hard to get that dark opacity
I'll definitely continue to use it with my laptop and Photoshop workflow
you're watching our hands-on review of a 8.5 inch LCD writing tablet now
and this is literally the end that you use to wipe down any marks
so if we write something on the board here like OS reviews
you can see that the color here is kind of inverted it
and it's a lot easier to make a mark on here
that's when you can erase elements from the page so using the erase tip
I can actually exert some pressure here and you can see that
it's actually doing a surprisingly good job of erasing very small
and you're able to maybe create some more realistic doodles and heart work
so that's pretty cool actually because the original boogie boards didn't have a replaceable battery
thanks for watching that's been the 8.5 inch LCD writing tablet with partial you race
it is using kind of like a rubberized texture though so it feels quite grippy
we're getting a dock here for keyboard expansion on the other side
I have too happy to say that it does the job
so if we have a look at something here so you can see the content
I think the Wi-Fi is the main kind of issue here with this tablet
the camera it has got one on it is 2 megapixel and you
can you know basically take a few shots here as you can see
Black Friday I picked up this RCA 7-inch Voyager tablet for 28 bucks at Walmart
I've realized that the 7 inch size is the perfect handheld size
anything bigger than that is gonna require a two hand hold 7 inch cheapo
and you're gonna have a higher screen resolution that than what's on this
depending on your needs as far as the resolution goes with these cheapo tablets
but just understand that in this thirty to seventy dollar price range
I think they're just the same rebranded product if you enjoyed the video

the pen has buttons on side to toggle between pen and eraser or other functions
oh the other ones are just tiny minor things like and being scratchy
that doesn't come over screen and that the pen doesn't have an eraser though
however you want to go about this and has a diagonal of 11 inch
it's like an eleven and a half almost 12 inch tablet
I don't have the pen holder that came of it when I first got it
you can place the pen on it or stick it in it
and yeah it's it gets kind of scratchy so by screen protector
if you're gonna buy it and it's good for what it is
my opinion the buttons on the side have brush enhance weighting zoom in zoom out
it's very affordable suits most people easy to install and compatible for most computers
welcome everyone to another review going over the physical features first two things
I said the same thing last year when they finished tablets were introduced
that gives an overall impression when you first pick it up
but let's go around the physical features here starting at the top
which of last year's model allows you to control your TV with your device
charging port justify to the right the 3.5 millimeter headphone ports
and as you can see these speakers are very much spaced apart for portrait mode
there's nothing on the left side of the tablet but rotating to the back
Samsung obviously didn't go full aluminum which is fine by me
but the build quality all around is still very well done
I guess to compare to the other model for the average consumer
the system specs are on your screen according to tech times comm
it is an older processor with quotes around the word older
this is still very zippy in a very fast device and we're world use
zippy and fast for all of your needs regarding battery performance
here the heir to Samsung still offers more features and I still believe
the build is still fantastic despite that SD card readers slot now
you guys take care and I see in the next one
I think I have used it enough to state the pros and cons about it
but there's a few hotkeys that you can press for tool shortcuts
a lot quicker it is a must for speed and also
and lastly just to quickly talk about the image you see me working on
I prefer coloring with these types of pen tablets rather than drawing with them
I have a tablet inside of it and to be honest with you guys
and it's we pronounce this this is X kadhi kadhi tablet PC
and all of those are the apps that you saw enjoy
this is actually the children desktop so we can go in
and then we good to go here we are in the official
I'm going to give you the model number which is T 9 0 1
a 33 this is also android 6.0.1 so guys it's the IB laptop
if you guys are looking for one of these to buy
all right this is the review of the arcus generation 8
Android experience a very very powerful device with a very fast
the six or five which was had the same screen size as this
now right now they are going to release it right now
$1.99 the idea of this device is to compete with that
you see you get a bigger screen a much bigger screen
we get down to the bottom and we load the food and get it experience
it might not take very long time to charger and pure need to test
I looks there is this which I've tested already and Aoife
you've seen that before and I'm really really good at this game
I think I transferred some some apk just to show you so if I exit
right here and this is using the oculus 43 as a mouse so
it looks to me like a 720p browsing browser basically the the android web browser
maybe you can even resume enabled optimize for HD HD HD so that was mind-blowing
the last is on the top okay camcorder mode for McGee per second
I don't know how haha the resolution is of this picture for example
the tablet is powered by a decocker magitek annual x7 processor
I tried and similar to my show me a one and A two phones
we have to be patient because this game loads quite slow on all platforms
oops okay so this game is terrible by singing we lost over show you
it's not very smooth and it's a bit too big to play this game okay
I want to be asked to check the multi-touch so let's go
I haven't used a keyboard a lot because it's not something I enjoy with Android
okay so let me take it out to bring up the soft keyboard
let's delete it and I will try to type you see I press them
d I have to press again so there was three times
I had to press twice because it didn't register on my key press
hello everybody thank you for tuning in to another episode of not analog comm today
Android so I didn't mention that runs Android 3.1 honeycomb which is good
and even if it's the first time you're using one it's very simple
they kind of add their own apps to it but before
I do you'll notice the size of the bezel on the side
I guess that really adds to the thickness when you do
turn the tablet on okay when you turn the tablet on okay
I know for example the Motorola Xoom is a lot of thinner
I do think that it was built for you to hold it this way
it kind of feels like this is what they wanted so
I just realized why I won't tell because I've got the screen locked
I know I'm only going to touch the one button there
okay so let's have a look at the inside of this thing
alright so we are looking at the this tablet you can see what
I did was sign in with my Google account and a straight
like the calc app which is you know your spreadsheets and things like that
so same thing with powerpoints called show and there is one for word
furthermore there's also a file manager so most of them do have this now
these little photos that are on the device so not ones that are actually on
Wi-Fi Bluetooth whatever you need to do so I think that's super super cool
I'm kind of rushing maybe but I don't think that I don't want to
you know those sort of things really are changing the game
I just think it's a little expensive for what it is based on its dimensions
I think I wouldn't want to carry this around every day
I think they just could have used the screen a bit better
whatever you want save it back your laptop super easy and
I think it's just a really cool way of doing it
I think that's a really good way of of selling a laptop as well overall
I'll put the link up if you would like to donate as well
Hello everyone, and welcome to this review video of the XP-PEN G640.
So the package comes with the tablet itself in a cute fancy little wrapping.
Even if it seems kind of "too much", that's actually a very good specificity
I don't know for you guys, but I always end up either
I wear them quite fast as I drag unlike most top players
our tablet is downloading the proper drivers on the company's official website.
After downloading it, install the right driver according to your OS.
It's not specified anywhere but I suggest you reboot your computer just in case.
I don't really know why, so I suggest you disable both of these.
Also, make sure to disable Windows Ink, that shit is not good.
Alright, we're ready to play with it to see how it feels now.
And finally, and for me that's the biggest drawback, the pen button
I don't have anything else to add on this tablet, I hope you enjoyed this
this thing is metal on the back plastic on the top and the bottom
I don't like that I actually bought a matte screen protector for this tablet
just kind of sucks especially when your hands are sweating so
um anyway let me show you color in some other place
I will say that I don't really have much of a
I don't have much or many complaints about the color here
my cell phone is actually an AMOLED display so I kind of used to that
the color here is a little bit a little bit more washed out
and you're looking at tales of demons and gods the manga
granted my recording room is a little bit brighter than most other rooms
it's perfectly viewable indoors but outdoors not so much because in outdoors
you really can't see this very well and you got clear here
P 22 T 4 gigs 64 gigs and a 1920 by 1200 resolution speed wise
it's really nothing special in fact the Android unit I have in
there's like a little bit of lag when you're swiping to Google
it's still not super fast but it was you know passable
I did not expect the battery life to be this good at all
I think yesterday I used it for I think 10 hours
I like it okay moving on bluetooth and Wi-Fi both work there
I felt extreme already but I'll play it one more time old
so it's a bit more interesting but again with gaming it's it's actually
it's just really bad for like swiping around in your home screen so okay alright
it's really hard to talk and game at the same time
I think I wind myself off candy crush for a while
and then and then he just came back with a vengeance
I don't get why tablet manufacturers still putting cameras in their tablets
it's stupid and just bad quality both the front and the back camera
I remember seeing advertisements on little was website for this tablet and they said Oh
I looked at the pictures I took and I was like no
I mean you guys still got a long way to go on this
that was pretty much it for the review of the lenovo tab now me
I'm trying to remember if I've missed anything and I actually do remember
i mainly use it to read comics and read manga and the long battery
life is a huge feature on this like a huge feature
I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys in the next one
I have read a lot of reviews regarding this tablet online
first for this particular tablet it supports 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
here there are some buttons that have been pre-programmed with keyboard shortcuts
and there's this little hand too there are also additional shortcuts here
I use by canon scanner so you can share the cables
let me show you the driver and some of the settings that you can change
some of the things you can change our the button functions on the stylus
there are two buttons here so you can change them to different settings
for example mouse click left right needle or a specific keyboard key
I will I normally leave this at default you can also change the pressure sensitivity
just that is it's very light so depending on your drawing preference
sometimes you may like a heavier pen sometimes you like appendage light personally
this is the bottom and it comes with four replacement nibs and there
I'm just going to show you some very quick very feet
and if you press down hard you can see that the lines
they taper quite smoothly as well and they taper very gradually
I'll try some thick and thin lines to show you now
let me just create a new file and try to and launch this alright
let me choose this pen here and show it to you
I lift it far away from the surface it stops so this is very problematic
I have I think that's almost all the software that I have for the shop
fine let's do a recap on the pros and cons of this tablet
so when you use your pen on this surface it gives you that slight texture
this is actually very similar to work on tablets and as for the cons
I think that's the probably the biggest con to this tablet
if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below
I'll put a USB link in the description for those who struggle with this issue
lastly the package comes with a nib removal tool with three replacement nibs
next let's talk about the driver while you can download the
I mean if they're playing maplestory is spending money on it
I really liked the idea of having a little Frankie Lera
Galen I'm Galen Island felt and today I've got a little product review for you
I was sent some tech to review by who young they sent me this
Inspira H 950 P which is one of their more popular pen tablets
I'm excited to see how this stacks up against what I currently use
the working area inside the tablet is 5.4 inches by eight point seven inches
I'm really excited to try out now before I get started
and that's as simple as going to hooey on tablet comm slash support
H 950 P with the tilt and I'm gonna download the driver for Windows
I I gotta say I'm really impressed with this tablet and coming from me
a lot of you guys already know star g6 40 it is
it's also going to have six customizable buttons so you can program it
which means you can use your left hand for multi purposes
let's get to the unboxing of star g6 40s by XV pen
it says please visit XP Pen website to download the latest driver
I'll have to replace that pretty soon as we open this up
cable management tied thingy which is also a nice touch this
that we don't really care too much about this is thank you for supporting letter
a warranty policy booklet a warranty extension card and a small quick guide
I'll also bring my CTO for 80 pound for comparison as you can see
why not write and also to add more will have a galvan
it's going to hopefully help with the slipperiness of the tablet
also painfully as you can see on the left side there are six customizable buttons
it's not like ultra thin like the g6 40 or gamma s 56k
the connector is gonna be on the left side of the tablet
might you know wonder if that's going to be interfering with the keyboard
it and the active area is supposed to be small on the g6
I'm clicking between you know the full area and the forceful portions
what's better is that now when you click this one on the right
you can just have it out all the time and be like
I use it looks nice and it will also look nice to other people too
as for the price thing the g6 40s is currently sitting at 45
I believe spending the extra 10 dollars for the better build
I believe exactly the same being replicated on the g4 g6
40s was a huge plus for me and as for the final verdict
- [Aaron] The Wacom One is Wacom's most affordable display tablet to date.
(pen scribbling) Now if the name Wacom One sounds familiar, you're not the only one.
Repeating names for multiple products seems to happen a lot at Wacom.
Personally, I would have called it Wacom Two, but I digress.
It has the essentials you need to make digital art and not much else.
So let's dive into this device and take a look at some of the specs.
I'll also do some painting on this device so you can see how it performs.
The screen measure is 11.6 inch wide by 6.5 inches tall.
So it's not the best screen in terms of clarity or color accuracy
The Wacom One is using an AHVA display with a Wacom EMR digitizer
And there is a matte anti-glare film applied to the tablet.
The film is applied very well without any bubbles or edges peeling off.
One is much closer to the Cintiq Pro models which I like.
The pen is lighter and smaller than the Pro pens and similar in
look and feel to the one that comes with the Intuos.
which looks a lot like a pencil and it works great on the Wacom One.
I can even vary the width of my line by pressing harder or lighter.
There are a few other pens that are supported and more pen
Now let's move on to discuss the build quality of the Wacom One.
The device itself is 8.9 inches by 14.1 inches with a thickness of 0.6 inches.
As far as the screen temperature I didn't notice any warmth.
The edges and the back of the tablet are kind of an off-white color.
Overall I'd say the thickness is closer to the Intuos Pro or the Intuos 2019.
And just for clarity, there is not a built-in computer in the Wacom One.
Now in order to connect the Wacom One to a compatible Android
Wacom's adapter which is not included, or a USB-C mini hub.
editing on the go if you're doing vlogs and travel videos and things like that.
but as of the making of this video it's not available quite yet.
You'll of course need two USB ports, one for data and one for power.
You can also use the Wacom One as a portable monitor through HDMI.
you might wanna use a monitor to monitor your video recordings or your photography.
who shoot on their phones to do some editing on the go.
Best of all Premiere Rush syncs with the desktop version through the cloud.
Concerning the stand, 19 degrees is not the most comfortable angle to draw at.
And there's no way to adjust the angle to a more vertical orientation.
It could be dirt from your hand or it could be grime
If this was your first time on this channel, check out
let's jump in and find out so just looking at this writing tablet
you have the main stylus here that used to actually write on the screen
it'll clear off and that seriously is all there is to it
that are you definitely want to know before you're picking this up so for one
you can't rub it out or anything you do actually have to start again
it would be great if you could erase it and likewise you can
you actually can't like you can't save the image or anything from the display
save what you've done without you know just taking a photo or something
and you know the pin just sort of flows over the display really easily
like it's lag free like there's actually zero egg it just happens straightaway
the pin flows really nicely but as I was saying there are a few drawbacks
maybe you'll find this useful as well really though that just wraps up this video
XP pen so special thanks to them I can check this out
let's take a look at the items that are included in the box
Start card and this year this is a four gigabytes USB thumb
there are eight replacement tips included this ring here in the middle
this is so much better compared to you know this black wire
this tablet does collect finger smudges a bit easily but I have to say that
it's the same for other brands of tablets as well on the back
you are not using the tablet you can choose to switch this off
this tablet has an auto slip function after 15 minutes of inactivity
I have a really filter of the functions that I do not want
I want to use the scroll down to increase and decrease my brush size
can you see the more changes from brush size to zooming
I can apply a very light pressure and get really thin lines like this
I can press down a bit harder to get thick lines like this
let me show you the transition between thin to thick the transition is quite smooth
let me show you how the lines how smooth the curve
some other tablets may draw curves like this or circular objects
sometimes you can see angular strokes but here the curves they are very smooth
Krita for some reason it's not just with this particular tablet with other tablets
with the antutu benchmark but that's not supported here since the Samsung Galaxy Tab
I also edited some photos with Adobe Lightroom and that works as it should sure
get closed fast on the background as they do on tablets was more
sure not as good as tablets both for speakers but good enough for its price
well as you can expect from 2 megapixel cameras the quality is bad
Amazon is shipping the Fire HD 10 was the same 10.1 inch IPS screens
I always think that the resolution is fine on 10 inches
range the Amazon Fire HD Tenace shipping with taya OS inversion 7.3
yes that's why apps like YouTube Gmail and the Google Play Store I'm missing
I didn't notice any big change compared to other recent fire tablets
Amazon photo apps own sake browser and a couple of standard ones like calendar
email app and the files manager integrated into file s is Alexa
I'm sure you're familiar with the voice assistant already the tablet supports Alexa
the tablet acts like an echo show and will display additional information
you won't see add anywhere else so it's not too annoying well except you see
either and if you're looking for something in particular chances are you won't find it
lets get to its battery life in my standard battery test
I can recommend without having to stay tons of downsides the value is fantastic
you're probably familiar with from your phone and you will likely get new
it's much smaller with its 8 inch screen and the performance is we got 2
alright the end of my Amazon Fire HD 10 2019 review
I have a really unboxed all the items so let me just show you
what are some of the things included so we have the foam pen case
it doesn't need batteries so you don't have to charge it
we'll look at that closer later on this is the USB cable for the tablet
this is the Quick Start manual and there this thank you cut
this is considered medium size and this is quite a good area to work with
$50.00 tablet this is the pen included supposed up to 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
it doesn't have a battery inside so you do not need to charge this pen
there are two side buttons construction the blue quality views very solid
which is normal because all these are pressure-sensitive styluses for graphic tablets
and when drawing on the tablet surface it feels really nice
the hovering distance is about one centimeter which is very typical of such graphic tablets
and when the pen is near you see this light hat that comes on
I'm not able to test that because I only have one monitor here
I have customized it to zoom in and zoom out for left and right
alright let's test out the tablet and see how good it is at drawing
I'm going to open up a file that I have created on my tax review
I'm going to use the trackpad to change the size of that person
but here you can see it tapers quite gradually so this is very good performance
the thin lines the thick lines clip studio works really well on this tablet
I'm not sure why only MIDI Bank clip studio has pressure sensitivity
I'm using this on Mac OS and it works really well so for us $50
that's all for my review today if you're also using this heaven
where is it this little doohickey right here called an S Pen haha
so you have a little bit of memory quite a lot of storage 64 gigs
there's integrated graphics and an Intel Atom CPU woohoo Intel Atom
unfortunately the speakers on this are pretty good for a tablet
there's dual speakers on both sides on this chrome finish on the siding
the two speakers are they can get very very loud however they are somewhat levels
the front camera is 720p and the rear facing camera is 2 megapixels
I personally enjoyed using this display however the resolution is only 1366 by 768
that's rather low for the 10-inch competitive market at this moment
both of those have much better resolutions than this guy does
it's very easy to use especially if you just want to watch some
Sailor Moon on YouTube but otherwise would I spend 750 bucks yeah
I'm Shannon Morse and this was the Samsung ativ tab 3
welcome to a new video on the geeky noise channel in today's video
Android tablet packed full of really good specifications and the value is fantastic
I'll prove it beforehand so I'm going to share with you my honest opinion
it's a nice lightweight design as well lightweight sort of metal design
in here with a frequency up to 1.6 gigahertz so a nice specification overall
that's not even available in HD let's pop an HD video up
I took earlier now just to let you know with regards to the cameras
I'm pretty sure the front-facing camera is I think it's 9 megapixels
and the rear facing camera is 13 megapixels so a good resolution on the cameras
let's take a look and see what they look like so we pop into gallery
I just can't find it so let's actually go into this through
here's some photos that I took using the Google Photos app
and here's one of they get all my life nice detail
it still managed to capture a nice amount of detail so very pleased with that
the camera does perform extremely well very very good camera performance
you can also capture video as well and you must remember that
the cameras on a tablet is not often the strong point
pickups we've got the power on/off button we've got the volume rocker
we've got a couple of speakers and round on this side
I give you my final opinion on this and another little look
I could see an elderly person using this for simple usage
excuse my studio light sort of catching the screen on this
I think it represents good value for money and it's well worth considering
do check out the links down in the video description area
now we're gonna take a brief look at the design so particularly at the back
you could just put your memory card in and there you have it
you have extra memory now if you take a look at the front panel
but we're just gonna take a brief look at the front panel
so you know this will obviously allow you to use those functions
we'll find the two megapixel front-facing camera alongside with the speaker of the speakerphone grill
which also allows you to make phone calls hence the use of the two
on the tablet there are no any other physical buttons no buttons on the display
so they're right next to each other means volume up and volume down
the microphone has to be there or somewhere in this region
this tablet costs one hundred and ninety six dollars and I just wanna you know
put that out there for you guys to consider throughout this entire review
always have that stereotype to be not as good as your typical
I've bought a few tablets in the past from China and they've been absolutely rubbish
they've had the worst displays the worst cameras the worst design and built quality
it cost 196 dollars and it performs like an absolute beast
well if you're going to compare this tablet with for example
and check out the link in the description to the tablet
I really like just how powerful the magnet is on the latching mechanism here
it's very positionable so you have a lot of different ways
they even tucked away a micro SD card slot in the back
there - if you want to augment some of its onboard storage there
they do have some other docks that they're going to come out with
you know this is the problem when you get into this
that will add some some bulk but also some weight to the package
and there's a cursor moving around very similar to what we've seen on the surface
also so it's not picking up my wrists as I'm writing here
so you'll have some decent wireless capabilities here and it actually looks really nice
it really did very well on that as well and again
and on the 3dmark cloud gate test which measures how well it might do
let's take a look at some movie watching all right so
I can skip ahead to different portions of the movie here no issues
this channel is brought to you by my patreon supporters including gold-level supporters
this is a video review of the visual land prestige elite 10 QL Android tablet
and stand as you can see here some other specs on this
looks like it has a screen protector on it right now
you can see this little film right here so probably eventually remove that
ok and let's go ahead and take a look at videos on this device
coming out soon so go ahead and play this projects so side
the only thing is the top and bottom viewing angles especially the top
there's a little tab right here and you can put it out like that now
so we put this kickstand out and the keyboard connects through this microUSB cable
it's been a pleasure to use and I definitely recommend it
my name is Alex and welcome back to a new review for today
well first of all we get an IPS screen with 1080p resolution
so the tablet decides we have some advantages and some disadvantages
you don't really want it all scratched up now on the left hand side
it's better than I was expecting so you can actually see the screen
and you're mostly gonna notice that when you're opening new app so if you open
you can also play games on this tablet and the tablet has a built-in accelerometer
I played the asphalt 8 and as you can probably see does work
it's definitely gonna be awesome to watch movies on it now
but it really depends how you use your tablet how you keep your screens brightness
we have insight and it's time to conclude this video so first things first
that's um why it slows down because it gets hot so for 200 bucks
guys hopefully enjoyed this video if you did like it press that like button
my name is Alex and welcome back to a new review today
we are checking out one of the most affordable 10 inchess tablets
of course the maximum resolution that you can select it's 720p but at 720p
and that's good because the tablet only comes with 16 gigs of internal storage
not to mention that you can actually make phone calls so this tablet
but then you'd have the speakers on the back so making phone calls to this
My goal today is to get the shady dealings I’ve experienced out in the open
That naive person won’t be you, not once you’ve heard this.
You need to review tablets from different companies to know which ones are good.
Be wary of how tablet companies use popular artists to try and sell you stuff.
so all of their fans learn that company exists and maybe end up buying something.
I’ve had two different companies go so far as to request
Don’t buy something just because your favorite artist did a video about it.
for comparison, a decent tablet company will send you the product for free.
They usually have a long, typed up description for you to copy and paste.
I’ve rewritten descriptions to be more clear, and was asked to change them back.
When this happens you’ll end up with a customs and import bill.
One contest required winners outside of certain countries to pay for shipping.
in many places; giveaways must be free to enter and free to win.
Normally a company either mentions no deadline, or around 3 weeks.
It’s your channel and you are an independent reviewer, not their sales department.
My experience 100% mirrors these guys, and they do way more tech reviews.
Links below to their perspective on the Painful Truth About Drawing Tablet Reviews.
we're just not sure quite when but it is in the works
so let's take a look at some of the design elements on the Galaxy
Samsung went ahead and moved the speakers to the front of the note
10-1 as opposed to the size or the back on many other tablets now
this setup allows the audio to be basically blasted towards your ears
we have the dock connector and a microphone and on the top
that's a great move and the IR emitter and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
there are a couple things to see on the back of the Galaxy
the scrolling is great zooming is responsive works really well but multi-screen is some that
nothing happens for a couple of seconds so while the app is technically still running
so it's really just for viewing windows side by side now
we should also point out that multi-screen only works with a core group of apps
let's let's pop that guy up here so this is something unique to Samsung
now you have a relatively small screen but as you see
you can use it to navigate the device just as you would your finger
I'm talking about now forgive me if I bump the camera and make it move
the galaxy note was so popular and they brought the technology to the tablet
check out the full review once again this is Marco Chiappetta for a hot hardware
titles if you're not an Xbox owner you prefer PC gaming
textured rubber grips provide a high comfort for those long gaming sessions so thanks to
so let's take a look at the system itself for some reason
Microsoft chose not to sell the system in the United States
it's solidly built has a great finish to both the casing and the glass
the tablet synced perfectly to my Microsoft account my gmail my xbox
it's great for sitting on the couch or in bed or out by the pool
my friend said that they can hear themselves when they spoke
which is there your left stick left trigger bumper and the d-pad on the right
you have your right stick right trigger bumper and the ax
I wish the grips were adjustable as far as the angle
what mess with my muscle memory is the positioning of the left and right stick
I'm used to these sticks being really close together and just by moving them apart
it kind of throws you off a little bit at first
that's small enough to throw in a backpack or small bag
I've been mainly opted to use the tablet or in tablet mode
I don't rarely use the PC mode only when I needed to dig
and you know if you're starting to shop for a Windows 10 tablet
it's great you know what more could you really ask for so
Steven from Tech Steve HD comm making technology easier in this video
I have the Zen pad 8 version 3 atm so sit back
let's take a closer look at the tablet itself on top of the tablet
you'll find a 2 megapixel camera and the cool thing about this
you have dark grey pearl white rose gold mint green and you also have orange
now and I showed you a little bit about the tablet
I'm gonna choose downloads and choose a blank app and so blue
and there's the main screen to put icons back on your screen
you can drop and drag them and you also can put widgets
you could have the display to automatically adjust itself or as the brightness
I can make a two hour video based off of that
you actually can make your own videos built into the software
I'm going to show you a couple samples of the photos
subscribe to my channel and I'll send the next one peace
and this is the Acer Iconia a 500 10.1 inch Android tablet
we'll take a look around the device and see back here
we've taken the plastic off the SIM card slot over here
but we assume there's a dock connector on the bottom for potential accessories
it's a pretty slim unit to the case is also not quite together over
it certainly doesn't look cheap or cheesy or anything like that
so nothing wrong with the display it's running Android 3.0 one honeycomb operating system
that's designed for tablets has a one gig of ram a dual core
does that beveled edge kind of thing there that makes it look a lot slimmer
your basic vanilla honey come so far not releasing any heavy customizations of honeycomb
there's no bookstore available in this region and the current bookstore
region selection is looks like twice now obviously as Germany and is that is China
well grab a copy of one write night and no registration or anything
so you can just in one doesn't finish downloading it so
so we're going to drop that down and it handles that just fine
you can go to the table of contents for example they also go your bookmarks
download something from one of those free sources like feed books so it creates a
but that gives you the ability then to transfer files no problem okay
that's pretty much a known quantity we've seen on other android tablets pretty presentation
the market has searched for both applications and books on honeycomb tablets
you can see it has a little indicator up there that tells me
now there's possible other application with just a front end to gallery anyway
you might say one or two frames drop here and there
but it's actually a fully animated video chalk up under the zoom here
YouTube player which has of course a beautiful glorious wall of monitors metaphor here
Wi-Fi since this isn't a free Jean you know to have an N connection
it will visit our own website and this is the standard on-screen keyboard
Tegra processors but the controls don't exactly work real well yet
it's a hack and slash game starting off with the cutscene here
now this is the tech class m89 tablet a hundred and fifty bucks
what the site things are you know you have your buttons
HDMI you have your headphone jack micro SD card and finally a USB C port
what the things are you have your power buttons your volume your camera your mini
headphone jack and a micro SD card slot as you can see it
LeBron James and on the sides here you have decent metals with bezels
that you can hold on to also as you can see
I know I say that a lot but really in these cheap tablets really get
I don't really use AMOLED display phones so most of the LCDs you know
but they're not that much better and in this display that
Tecla 79 does a pretty good job and I like it quite a bit
I read quite a lot of comics a lot of Marvel Comics in
it looks very very good and 4x3 is perfect for reading comics
16 by 9 16 by 10 is a little bit narrow for reading comics
I'm gonna show you what it looks like so as you can see
there is actually not a lot of bass in this tablet and it's fairly noticeable
I don't really see that very often in tablets and even if I did
as long as it's optimized well so I think is very smooth
it's pretty much as smooth if not smoother than a shammy me pad three
I think this one actually beats the meat pad three slightly in terms of smoothness
I'm gonna clear all so I can show you what I'm talking about
you have three gigabytes of RAM and the 30 gigabytes of RAM is sufficient
but sometimes it's not enough so as you can see opening
you know it opens pretty much instantly the open on Google Play Store
does you know it starts lagging and slowing down and closing apps on you
so lastly will open manga a on and this one takes a little bit longer
it's I think it's filling up the RAM a little bit
so there's that to be concerned about now moving on to gaming
I was not able to play asphalt extreme every time I tried playing asphalt
extremely would tell me that this thing kept on crashing which is very strange
there was a little pop up there that was just to show you that
so there's yeah that's that's something that I I'm very surprised
inch display has 10-point touch and a display resolution of 1 to 800 by 800
so let's start with the pros with its five thousand milliamp hour battery
this is suitable for work and play even watching a movie on
the only problem though is that you wouldn't have to mind carrying around
there's a link to my review of that up there in the YouTube cards
and if you do know anyone would be willing to loan us
the device for review or possibly sponsor an episode of texans array
we will be reviewing the tech class p20 hd 10 inch tablet from lazada
the first thing you will see is a tablet wrapped in protective plastic
the tablet itself a type c cord a sim injector an adapter
the warranty card and the manual seen on top of the tablet is an earphone
you may insert a sim card and an sd card to expand
its storage or use it as a cell phone after setting up the tablet
but if you want to include a case it is worth 6499 pesos
p20 hd includes a 2 megapixel front camera and a 5 megapixel back camera
the front camera is decent enough to use for online class
the tablet could handle the software or the internet was too slow
your team destroyed the turret victory in terms of drawing on this tablet
that is all i have to review and i hope you found this video informative
then you will see the shortcut of the graphic tablet in your desktop
it has the exact same specs but the performance is different
the front facing large chamber studio speakers are visible following the curve around
we will see the front of the stand to access the stand
The Stand sports for different angles or as Lenovo calls them
I'm going to say a statement that you will hear several times throughout this review
2 these two devices are the same under the hood the 8 inch IPS
the pixel density is 283 which gives it text that pops off the screen
this includes images to the color reduplication and saturation looks great
the high shine and the shadows gives you a sense of depth
I won't say it runs as smooth as a nexus 7
some would say is very iOS like and I would mostly agree
Lenovo package is a good amount of applications on the device
most of the applications they supply are applications that would either have came with stock
most of the applications are forgettable and quickly become background annoyances
the camera cannot keep up even in good lighting using studio lighting
HD 1080p and the issues I had with the pictures translate to the video mode
lenovo has made a lot of strides with this tablet versus the 10 inch
make sure you check out the written companion piece down below
welcome to a video from the juice lifestyle calm and in this video
Leah 770 Android tablet difficult to stand out in the neck in a Android Market
so it's a nice cheap option so we're going to do we'll open the box
fire it up and see what we can do with it
I'm just signed in with my Google accounts so fire a few things up
so let me just give you some of the specs first
anyway he may come but say it's not the available moment
you also get a lot of these apps installed a support laces store
come and we've got a front-facing camera as well which is 0.3
megapixels so okay maybe for selfies and go and that is really about it
use a phone or my proper camera but it's nice to have the option
let's try some performance so here we are with the web browser
I'm accessing some of those services browser but once you're there it's okay
I think that the kind of things you would use this for
we'll try out some apps and see how that compares now
what for watching videos and something else that just spotted that it perhaps not understand
something called float gadget where you can have a floating window now
think you could probably to a switch from app to app quite quite easy anyway
is that double tap to wake which you just switched on here which is something
there wait so so now we've got a game and with the Atom processor
it's got a sort of nice soft plastic back which quite like battery life
reasonable brightness not check the high resolution it doesn't feel too cheap
the Lenovo to add Chromebook is one of the most interesting tablets of the year
Chrome browser a keyboard a pen option and updates for eight years
I think that looks fine but I know not everybody loves this
we're seven points three millimeters it is thin enough and with 450 grams
there's no fingerprint scanner and you can't unlock it using facial recognition either
it's connected to the tablet using magnets and they're very strong
the cover is made of a plastic and the kind of fabric like material
the keyboard is a bit smaller than a standard one still
maybe you will have to get to use to it a bit but the keys
we do get the touch pad which sits below the keyboard
Chrome OS tablet has been released in Europe since then I know
Android tablet will be the heart of Chrome OS is the Chrome browser
the tablet is so interesting because of Chrome at an affordable price
open them side by side and close them in desktop mode
the desktop mode is a bit more stable and seems more finished
it makes no sense to do so but you can do that as I said
Chromebook I've installed a LibreOffice for instance and it runs fine the Lenovo IdeaPad wot
Chromebook has a 10.1 inch IPS screen with an aspect ratio of 16 by 10
it is a resolution of 1920 by 1200 pixels and as usual
you can rest your palm on the screen for instance and it gets ignored
you can get versions with 64 gigabyte and 128 gigabyte of internal storage
the tablet has to no micro SD card slot in benchmarks
Tab s 5e those are mid range tablets that cost about the same
it's not a great immediate tablet if you want to watch movies and play games
I think an N word tablet or iPad is much better suited
is that you get access to lots of more apps that are optimized for tablets
you can see two gigs of RAM this is the s8 an Android version 9
32 gig storage 4,000 milliamp battery good for about 8 to 10 hours
assistance is built-in so when you pick up the tablet you'll notice it's very light
but one good thing about that is if you're using it for extended periods
the display is very vivid has excellent colors and very good
display very punchy colors so excellent for web browsing browsing the web is just excellent
it's a very nice tablet for a good price one $39.99 comedian
doing another tablet review this time for xp pen innovator 16 big shiny pretty box
it's very like pretty and modern looking with the silver and black
you can see there's like uh express keys there on the left
um but we're gonna be looking at that a bit later first
there's a little cleaning cloth that you get which is very nice
this is where i immediately screwed up because i took off
it kills me so what you're going to do is pull that tag
uh you just pop out the back like that you can see
these ones on the left will be going into your pc
i point at the diagram there and this is what it looks like
there's also a little look at the specs there for you so download the driver
whether that's mac or windows i have windows so i'm gonna download that one
i thought it felt really nice like while i was drawing this
i didn't really feel uncomfortable any point i wasn't really stuck to my tracks
um you can see sort of the comparison with me going really slow and fast
um the tilt is a little bit off you can see
so that's great no charging or no batteries or anything just works right off
the bat can be powered by just the computer alone like we covered
there were fine but i was kind of like as i mentioned before
um it did fix when i minimized photoshop and maximized it again
it's a bit weird but with with every tablet you're gonna have weird little glitches
i don't think i'd trust any of their newer tablets anymore
well they're they're newer monitor tablets like they're pros and stuff
so i'm probably gonna keep using it for a little bit longer
it's sorry it's a sponsored video but um yeah thank you
so tyd is the name it runs on android 6 which is the KitKat
take it down so it's nice and low but anyway alright now
I'm just gonna check to see whether there's any software updates on it
things get that downloaded put various others on as well and then we can
click onto that and again it brings up all the available
I've put YouTube on just so that you can hear it more than anything else
I was saying there was plenty of volume a little bit Timmy
they are easy to scratch so all in all sixty pounds each great absolutely fantastic
so so my first impressions are that it's a bit leggy
so it has a pretty decent sound quality for $100 tablet
it's not as loud as a more expensive tablet but it's a pretty decent
so that's that was really confusing to me at first also
let me just take some pictures and see how they perform
I'm gonna take a picture so you guys can see the quality
it's really just a very low quality camera for FaceTime or Skype calls
I was expecting it to have decent cell quality and a decent screen
subscribe to the channel and I'll see you guys in the next video
it's not 1080p if not 2k it's not the most amazing display
it's in here which is awesome and then ports which also
you could put like a keyboard because they do have a version of this
that's not all you also get a case inside of this
so let's jump around this tablet just a little bit and talk about its performance
I'll talk about one thing I don't like at all and that's the sound
I can do a video on here 720 60 and you can see
there's no problems weird performance and trying to loading up videos
and it's loading up that website websites go on and I'll play a video there
I've noticed that gets a little funky on there and you can see it
who's just looking for something to watch videos on or do simple simple games
we go subway surfer similar game to the Ryan's world world game and performance again
still the same there where you can get decent performance on this
I am not good at these games but I always say that
that's why ooh train come in doing really well is the best
but just you know loading up a website and seeing how it performs on here
if you're curious at the bottom you have a back button home
Google duo so you can do some you know chatting on this
you know and it's you can see there's nothing on here
check it out if you're looking for an expensive budget tablet
let's actually use the tablet to talk about it so first of all right
I have locked but I will not press because I'm too afraid
this tablet is absolutely no exception 13.5 inches so it is large
it's about this much shorter than an a4 and about this much narrower
um she had the pen is completely passive is xiaomi branded
holy a dozen didn't have money for my okay at latches
sorry sorry-sorry pen also latches to other magnetics things but like briefly
its not gonna survive in a bag but it's good enough right
i think i'm not should i finished it's $23 including shipping
so you can't locally erase this button only erases absolutely everything on the screen right
so i've written some some some pros and cons before that
let me actually zoom in right if you press super hard
I'm barely touching it right so I'm barely barely pressing down on it
it doesn't so no pressure hotspots on the inside at least none that
I mean this is the biggest problem if somehow they could get that fixed
no it isn't like far along enough to warrant like starting fresh if right so
I think there's others that have different colors or they just
there's a lock button right which technically now is set to lock
it's actually zoom in on this because everything done is everything like design wise
this is very beautiful right so lock and unlock and so now technically
let's write something on this habit display something so show me a writing tablet
it is battery powered so this is a lot more kit than this
this is some kind of LCD technology and yeah this is not too bad oh
I'll show you guys the colors so colors would would look like this
there's tools right so you can move stuff around alright as you can move stuff
you can't technically write on this as well but this pen is the same shot
it is very nice so you have a bunch of tools right
you can't get finer pens right so this is basically the
I need to go back to a hundred no pinch to zoom
it's saying move doesn't work anymore and why the doesn't move work anymore like
I really would like to move stuff right and say that doesn't work
and you get this thing up here so that's always gonna be there
moving around is also a pain in the ass you can see now all the
I will say that at times it is a bit annoying
I'm sorry like if if you're watching this video and you still have Windows
let's just leave it at that and see it uploads the stuff it has
there's absolutely no way this is falling out and it's pretty expensive
I don't know but extremely well done and fits the table
but if you don't have the time for that this is a super good option
it's a completely different use case scenario though so comparing them is
all for sure answer them as I get more familiarized with both these devices right
what's going on guys long hair from Android authority and good
up top followed by a large plastic flap that covers the microSD and sim slot
sony has also made a big emphasis with audio on the z4 tablet
there's built-in high res audio support for reduced distortion and digital noise canceling technology
they're loud crisp and clear and don't show any signs of distortion
considering there aren't many tablets with front-facing speakers let alone having even two speakers other
that's expandable up to an additional 128 gigs by a microSD
just fine if you're in a pinch but you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment
if you're expecting the same level of quality that can be achieved on a smartphone
you've also got the life log application which has become a standard app across
Sony's most recent devices and it's great for not only tracking your fitness data
allow you to play virtually anywhere you want in your home
and there's also another version that comes with an included keyboard dock for 759
so what is it about the z4 tablet that makes it a great
and it's about time and om finally got it right as always guys
if you did enjoy please give it a thumbs up down below
this is the 2020 version of one of whom's most popular pen displays
I needed to use sandpaper to get all the features working properly
Brad and I review tech for creative professionals people like you
illustrators designers at one-horse they taught to paint the hue on canvas
hey bro additionally though this display can be plugged into certain
I think we've reached a plateau and drawing technology in recent years
I went with the Cosmo black and I kind of regret it
feels good to use with the stylus and it's not too slick
I do get some check marks on really fast lines not something
I noticed when I was drawing just when I was testing it out
I also tested on Windows and it doesn't look like it does it
Mac and I did test on two Macs both running catallena
there's a nice little stand that you can prop up at a couple different angles
just having one cable provide your power and your data in that HDMI port
it doesn't work for transmitting data and a signal so it jumped on Amazon
Huyen USBC cable and that's how I found it on their website
functionality isn't available for every device there's a list of compatible
you're gonna have to toggle on decks to get everything running well
decks turns your phone or tablet into a desktop like interface
X can go fullscreen but it doesn't have any pressure sensitivity
it's painting app called hue on sketch which I reviewed weeks ago
it feels like a step towards something cool but the software and the hardware
it's just that when you get to those new features especially those Android features
thank you for watching and I'll talk to you a couple of things you
it is much cheaper because prices are starting at just $80
okay but actually that's mostly the end of me praising it
you will need it if you want to listen to music or watch movies
there's one single speaker placed above the screen and while it's loud enough
IPS screen other aspects like color reproduction contrast and brightness are okay
I'm using the version was 1 gigabyte of RAM in the 16
HD videos in this case I noticed occasional legs when watching with this resolution
it is very disappointing that its performance is too weak for basic multitasking
if you want you can install the normal versions using the
Play Store but they don't run as well in the case of Chrome and YouTube
in addition to those google apps are couple of standard ones pre-installed
according to the press release are talking about ram version will be shipped with normal
only if you want to spend as little money as possible and prefer pure Android
a 8.0 even though both costs around $130 you do get normal
hey everybody its la inside but and we're taking a look today at the new
it's a mediatek mt6752 bytes and it also has 16 gigabytes of internal storage
really not bad as a reading device or media consumption device decent color on it
I don't like the dress products up here on the channel
so for $79 you can get a echo device with a screen which
there's ways to get it on here but it's not all that consumer friendly
it's not something that a lot of consumers are going to do
I don't think this will be any better or worse than prior versions there
when you're plugging in that charging cable headphone jack is right here
too with microphones built-in and you've got a volume rocker over there
and see how that streams up here so you can see by and large
it's not going to be a speed demon if you are a YouTube fan
so what you're looking at here is essentially the mobile web version of YouTube
because it's so tightly integrated with the device and its operating system after all
Amazon tablets are designed for you to be purchasing Amazon content
a lot of these are the same versions that you'll find on the other
this is the remake of Sonic CD and it works with my Bluetooth game controller
Amazon turn on show mode and you can see here now
I would see if I had a echo show device what I'm noticing though
turn off show mode and then it will revert back to that tablet interface
it's very reasonable $79 price tag until next time this is lon
and if you're a regular viewer of the channel you know
you're also gonna receive some extra accessories that make this a real
Chromebook now this comes with the 64 gigabyte model or the 128 gigabyte model
it's got a decently sized trackpad given that we have a 10.1
and if it's sitting on the desk it's fine with that kickstand up but if
the tablet uses USB type-c gen 2 for charging and syncs
in two variants 64 gigabytes of storage and 128 gigabytes of storage
it's a 10.1 inch IPS display at 1920 by 1200 with 400 nits of brightness
we just have a touch interface when the keyboards detached so the first benchmark
this is strictly testing the CPU out over on the Left
I'm connected to my 5 gigahertz network and everything seems to work
I'm using the beta version so I can see the FPS
I personally love this game - the in-app purchases but I still play it
overall on low-end hardware this really struggles to play perfectly and unfortunately on the duet
Call of Duty mobile and this is definitely playable on the duet
this is a very well optimized game it works really good on low-end Android tablets
so it's pretty sure we'd have good luck with this one
do not pick this up but if you have to have
I mean it's definitely not a tablet anymore but with the accessories removed
I also reviewed recently so today we're gonna find out what's different about this one
the innovator 16 is meant to be a higher-end version of the artist
let's check out what's in the box when you open it
the first thing you see is the tablet itself of course in an underneath here
so we're gonna have the outlet adapters on the left there
little wiping cloth nothing too interesting in the other box here
we have the the cables so this is going to be the same
obviously is the look of it so it looks significantly different
I'm not a big fan of that because it can get damaged pretty easily
it's a hundred and twenty five percent so not really any different and really
this tablet is just an almost identical clone of their previous model
but with a slimmer profile and a nicer design in my opinion
the height is a little bit less on the newer tablet than your model
I could spot a slight difference but it is very slight slightly better now
I was also slightly disappointed when I when I first got it that
I found out that the price difference was only 50 dollars
there is not much parallax and it's very very responsive of course
though as you see me working here it wasn't really a problem
it's definitely not something that I keep thinking about as I'm working
I just can't draw because I forgot to charge the damn pen
I'll have one myself and I just really hate using it
then it fits in here if it's both affordable and enjoyable then it's great value
I get bug or something that makes it really annoying to use and here
I couldn't think of any to put in that section next
I'm going to place the innovator 16 in the context of this chart here
oh there it is so here very similar to its little brother
I just think it looks better for traveling and that kind of stuff
I haven't mentioned that you think people shouldn't know about so
include the full specs and on the blog post on the dish live.com
it's got a few things that the surface pro or my certainty
so that means you can plug your SIM card in and use it
and there's a nice big trackpad that sports 2 finger scrolling things like that
there's also um Poynter if you like those kind of things you can use that
but with this you've got the option of the trackpad and the three button
what's really good so it's a really good performing machine for that
it doesn't get too hot even even while playing stuff like minecraft
she'll have no problems doing like basic games like this like
I said you also will be able to do PowerPoint Office X
but you also be able to do things like video editing photo editing
the pen is use it as a tablet cause you can use it like that
I'm with word as well so we'll check that one thing
we load something up and we can talk about that so they this group
this green is extremely clear and bright really vivid color reproduction
very businesslike device it really is very comparable to surface pro 4
maybe even the surface book because the keyboard feels a bit more substantial
so it's premium device premium prices but a very nice device
you can read more information on this on our blog post
set it up test it out and review all the amazing things it does
the screen has a 1280 by 800 resolution with the 10 inch IPS display
the tablet power adapter the power cord reset tool and instruction manual
the screen cover gives you the simple steps to get started carefully
it's perfect for browsing the web watching videos playing games and taking photos
setup doesn't take that long hold the power button for three seconds to get started
I love the auto rotate feature where else how about sports now
great resolution how about downloading and playing some of your favorite games game time
oh there's my another favorite game bejeweled for how about taking some high-resolution photos
here are some actual unaltered photos from the tablet stunning one amazing thing
pharmacy is two minutes from your location by car and light traffic here
your destination is on the right one of my favorite things
FM radio plug in the headphones which act as the radio antennae genius
Blu load dragged down the top right menu again hold down the Bluetooth button

thanks for dropping by before we get into this review go ahead and hit that
okay so you probably love to draw and that's why you stumbled upon our video
what if you can have both a high quality product at a affordable price point
that is the pitch that hue ion is trying to make
say that the tablet is similar to the Intuos Pro M
the pen doesn't feel poorly made by any means but feeling the ones made by
which is the most important factor at the end of the day
the pen comes with a separate charging cable which seems a bit cumbersome
that means you'll have to carry the tablet's cable along with the
Hyun's website to get the most up-to-date version of the driver setting up
I'm not really quite sure where those are mapped on the tablet itself
but you got to play around with it for a bit
the sheer amount of custom it brings is very welcoming jumping into the driver software
I love is the ability to use this in a split-screen setup
our answer is absolutely yes you can probably get a higher quality
it's really hard to not justify getting this considering the price
let me put this from a perspective of a youtuber such as myself
are there better cameras / tablets out there absolutely as we progress with our channel
it is at the very least three to four times cheaper than what
if you like this video go ahead and give us a thumbs up
and today we're going to take a look at the Fujitsu stylistic and 532 tablet
Fujitsu sells us both to companies and direct online to consumers
you can buy it right off their website if you want so you know
now in terms of thickness because those do tend to be you think of it
I guess you hear our volume controls as our microUSB port
I imagine overseas where you can get a 3g version of this up top
this is as vanilla and implementation of Android is you could ever see
well you certainly get it here our little control menus pretty much straight
if we go on the settings page you can see just basically your standard
eleven thousand seven hundred and thirty six for SunSpider javascript test
so again just what you would expect good performance there so in terms of performance
then we'll check out a video see on that place okay
it on too close man works well and for video playback in viewing photos
mpeg-4 1080p obviously is higher than the resolution of the display itself
it plays just fine as the sound quality is pretty good too
distinctly better than average 8 megapixel camera takes sharp photos and good video 10
you can see we can go all the way up to 1080p for resolution here
here's a photo that we took so definitely better than average camera for a tablet
now we're in debt triggered and we can see tegra3 effects going on here
the tablet has a two cell lithium ion battery as usual for tablets
Fujitsu stylistic M 532 Android tablet available now 549 and for that price I
that's Asus proprietary connector on the right side of the tablet volume rocker
here is your sink in charge port and another small pinhole for reset functionality
multitasking is absolutely a huge strength for Windows 8 and Windows RT
okay once we get that orientation it actually renders the screen
and so we've got here in the standard desktop mode here with Windows
but here we've got things like spotlight apps from pops eye
social media apps and as you can see entertainment photos music and video
engine as you can see pretty darn good especially in the tablet device
Hydro Thunder hurricane and that is currently available for $9.99 on the Microsoft Store
huion a drawing tablet company contacted me about reviewing their newest graphic tablet
tablets are one of the most accessible ways to create digital art
this tablet is how large it is for comparison this is the Wacom Intuos tablet
you'll notice this tablet comes with a ton of express keys too
I actually love the express keys on the pen a little more
I cannot demonstrate that but I still think it's really really cool
it felt slightly more natural especially when I was using the pencil tools
the tablet was its color or their color that I chose the hs6
a brush size adjustment shortcut and zooming in and out of the canvas one thing
this tablet has everything that you could ever need to successfully create beautiful digital art
this is just a color it does come in four different colors
it comes in kind of a grayish color a gold color and a blue color
so it's pretty nice that you comes with different colors now
I didn't like the footage but I'll I have all the things here
I don't know what this material is in this carrying case
it has two buttons on it which is really nice the the only thing
obviously with every tablet you get you get a little glove from
is you get the Quick Start Guide in this little baggie
the mapping for what part of the screen that's gonna control the functions
you want to have it so that any time you open a Photoshop
CDs are reused or they're very old they don't print new drivers on those CDs
now if you follow me or you subscribe to me you'll notice that
I draw with it but my impressions of this tablet are very good very positive
it's a 10 by 6 inch work area which is really nice
you really can't beat this kind of quality you get the 12 buttons
really hit it out of the park with this one again
if you enjoyed the video give it that thumbs up subscribe for more videos
it doesn't require battery to work two side buttons and that's the name in front
the drawing area is about ten by six inches and the surface
when you're turning it the overall look and feel it's very professional
you can set mouse functions if you are using extended monitors or dual monitors
the whole drawing area has been mapped onto the whole desktop
the tablet can still be used for drawing so no worries
there has tested drawing performance so pressure sensitivity works really well the pen
overall drawing of four lines here with MIDI Bank paint Pro
I'm drawing with my mouse like what I'm doing right now
lag that happens with other tablets as well pen pressure seems to work fine
nice let's take a look at that transition from thin to thick
in fact let me reduce the pen size so this is how pressure sensitivity works
and it's quite sensitive because the pen is sensitive so when a tissue
though the illustrator pressure works fine and this is very responsive
unlike photoshop this tablet can actually be used with android devices
so sometimes for me to get a wireless connection to work
so now you see the cursor there and disconnect this to connect a wireless receiver
I hope that it can be recognized and it does work now
this tablet definitely gets a 5 out of 5 stars from me
Photoshop with MIDI band paint Pro and clip studio paint the drawing performance
I'm not sure if I can recommend that this for me
it's a good product you can check out the pricing on my own website
link will be in the video description below and thanks for watching this review
I reviewed all of them and you can find videos about them on this channel
Lenovo Tab E 7 as you might expect at this price point really no vote
it is where we thick and weighs 272 grams on the right side
there's a microphone on the bottom and on the left side we get a micro
the tap e7 has a 1 single speaker which is located above the screen
its sound quality is kind of acceptable to watch some YouTube
we get a 0.3 megapixel front-facing camera and the 2 megapixel main camera
again we have to keep its low price and mind and as you might expect
it is important to note that the Amazon fire HD 8 gets a noticeably
it is important that standard epsilon smooth enough and actually that is the case here
TF 7 essential let one worship to a standard Android instead of Android go
it is also important to know that this is not a multitasking tablet
apps get closed fast in the background and if you use
some of them might have to reload if you switch between them
that only happens when switching from another app or the home screen to Chrome
Ram and no the tap is 7 is not a perfect gaming tablet
I don't think it will ever get em at 9 lenovo
the operating system runs smoothly and I like it quite a bit
it seems like at least the keyboard things that this is a smartphone
the keyboard is smaller than it should be on 7 inches
only two of those are games that you can uninstall easily one reason why most
Epsilon smoothly on here might be the Google go apps for example instead of standard
YouTube go the design is much simpler than what we get less than at YouTube
I aimed at markets was bad internet as well a couple of words about Netflix
you can watch movies with us tablet without any issues however you cannot watch
that anyway said is not a big deer in this case inside
Lenovo tapi 7 review and I've got to get to my final words
all of that runs smooth enough especially when you're not a power user
you cannot take out photos with the cameras and the speakers are acceptable at most
a direct competitor with a similar price is the Amazon fire
7 the fire 7 and Lenovo type II 7 have almost identical hardware
Google Apps manually but I think the value is much better here
if you have any questions please write me down below and subscribe to this channel
i'm andrea for my next approach calm and I review pretty much
the pen itself is a bit thicker than the one and
I'm used to but it feels really solid and comfortable holding it
there's a smudge guard glove that fits nicely the cable is a 1 meter
I'm handling it so let's get this plugged and see how it performs alright
editing we are back with the drivers already installed loading up their configuration app
you can see your tablets model in the top left corner
you can also test your pressure sensitivity here as you can see
and you can see the pressure being indicated on the bar
I'm running a dual monitor setup when I was testing it
and it's very simple so easy to use and now back to the hardware
I assume considering the fact that it comes with 20 replacement nibs
I got some base colors in and started blending them all together
and when downloading the drivers I found myself clicking the icon of the operating system
the product is more of the website issue for the accessories
and even though it's a bit too thick there are no batteries to weigh down
the tablet is thick enough so it doesn't bend at all and value for money
you get 14 buttons 60 inches of drawing surface 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity
plus it has more spare nibs that you would ever need and a smudge guard
I went on to do a drawing with it and this is what happens
if you found this useful you could consider drawing a like in there so that
my opinion is based on my previous tablet experience and I would definitely say that
in order to celebrate the 1000 subscribers let me know in the comments below
I'd love to hear your suggestions and yes I do read all of them
shout out to the people that made this amazing fan art on my discord server
this is the Signature Edition meaning that it doesn't have any blower on it
the folds over with the subtle curves on to the display
so it's just a bit off which is equivalent to point 68 pounds
the microphone is placed at the bottom right side of the tablet
it has been recognizing my voice for 80% of the time hey
gigahertz ban where this tablet falls short is in the sound
it is more suitable in a room where there's not much noise going on
it feels a bit uncomfortable to hold for a very long time
the tablet is very fragile and any drops will damage the soft aluminum body
another thing that may be a downfall is that the tablet doesn't get that
Al's for racing game works great on it which I'm playing right now
it is not easy to play with my arms wrapped around the tripod so
I'm not big gamers so I don't spend hours gaming on it
it does get a bit warm after a while using it
I'm browsing the web watching youtube videos and doing some light multitasking
fire tablets a good value but I also just picked up this and what
the film remove threw them on the back of the camera
it's a little shorter but it's a little taller as well right so
I get a little bit more of a TV screen look
aluminum construction looks like we have the speakers on the back here
the camera right up there looks like there's even a flash
I'm not sure if that's a light or home port there it is
I can go powered by Android powering up and then so all
I will say I do like how light it is in my hand
and that's partially because little plastic and now how loud it's playing
oh maybe I don't know a little more solid me me but heavier
and so that's the trade-off and so you can see right here like
do you want that wider or screen or though the largest thing
whatever so you want to pick up this matrix pad z4
I will put a link to in the description below Peter
so this is the box of the tablet its model is 2
this is a small piece of cloth for wiping and clearing the tablet
this is the pressure this is the pressure sensitivity adjustment curve
I will provide the link in the description of this video
now let me show you the other side of this tablet
you don't need to connect it to use the other side so let's do it
you can draw or write on it anything for approximately 50,000 times
if you like this tablet you can purchase it from the link which
this is a nice contribution to the whole children's interactive media category and
and the power on button and at the back that is in pi
so that's it guys if you want a good chat with under 10,000 rupees
see at this point so you'll still have to use that the other parts
this is just what it looks like on the back here
in this you will get bluetooth 4.0 you get a headphone jack
so if you want to plug in some headphones it's like
it's all the way up there and then other than that
yeah let's get into the review of this tablet so first off
not that bad the viewing angles are pretty good as you can see
it's pretty the colors are actually pretty down and darn good on this
even though it's only 720p videos you can only choose to play them at 7
it's a under $100 tablet it's literally 95 bucks right now on Amazon
and just getting the tablet to roam around the operating system and things like that
it's again not too bad for what it does under 100 bucks as you
that this tablet will easily handle and in literally a hard bucks
it's nothing to write home about there's one I took with the front camera
they're both 2 megapixels on the front and the back again they're nothing crazy
if you're just you doing you know videos and really nothing else
Android experience on here and there's no blow Ware on here when I came on
six in fact it was my favorite tune one of 2018 and
it's powered by the Intel 8th generation cable 8 processor either the Core
terabyte of SSD storage and up to 16 gigabytes of ddr3
RAM it comes with a micro SD card slot and an optional
but it's good to see they throw that pen in the Box
with my 21 percent discount code twenty four dollars eighty nine cents
fifty four cents after my twenty one percent discount code that's incredible want the 2016
I have a special 10% discount code for that and that's another great savings right
there watering is easy and safe head on over to lvl
the star of the show is it's gorgeous 13 inch IPS
it's certainly above the category average and one of the best in this category
the colors are really vibrant and just seem to pop off the display
excellent key travel with the touchpad and of course that great rack point which
which is it really good especially when you compare to its chief competitor
it's actually pretty good eye for considering this is a two and wanna
this is a 1080p 30 frames per second and it's good for Skype
it's good for video conferencing but again let me know what you think about it
this is a tablet and the video as you can see here wasn't too bad
that didn't get loud enough as I stated and I just wasn't impressed now
this is actually a pretty good package so to wrap things up can
I recommend the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet 3rd gen and the answers
there are no real deal-breakers unless you consider the battery life a deal-breaker
I'm gonna give this a score of 89% making the x1 tablet worth your money
it's got that excellent keyboard we've come to love with the ThinkPad line
KB Lake processor although I would love a refresh with the whiskey Lake processor
now speaking of the looks it is a major fingerprint magnet
don't forget to leave a comment in that comment section below
Facebook on Twitter Instagram and of course my website AMD Tech reviews.com
so until next time this is andrew from AMD tech see ya
and this is the series h6 of what it says on the amazon website
i had to read up on it because i thought what does that mean
which test the compatibility of google apps with the android device this baby
you can read on it take photos and do some painting
great brain it has a 5 000 milliamp battery and it has type c connection
plus a minus headphones not sure what that is and connections
normally you'd like to see what all the connections are normally
i didn't mention which is cameras so front camera rear camera as you can see
so everything is there so you have a clock you drive which is external
and i will be guessing you need to go in here network blah blah blah
i just want to see what does are you sure you want to close
there's a little bit of lag there but you've got to understand
of course we don't care right so we'll do my stream deck
i see press play so you've got to bear in mind
this is never going to be a fantastic picture quality but is it good enough
that is a photo i believe so i took a photo
wasn't expecting it'd be fantastic picture quality on video and camera
the quality of the videos from youtube are excellent or any films
they are very good nice and clear as you can see in my video
i think like i said for the amount of money you pay
definitely get my thumbs up on this and hopefully you like it
what you think about it i think like i said for 83 pound
that that you can upgrade the memory to up to 128 gigabytes
i think it's well worth the money so with that what i will do
if you didn't give us a thumbs down and please subscribe it's free
what's going on guys the CTA praten back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at and testing out the new tab m7
power switch and our 2 megapixel rear camera over on the left hand side
now that's what we're gonna go over now for a $60 tablet
gigahertz media tech Mt MP to one gigabyte of lpddr3 Ram a 7 inch IPS
Android we do have the Google Play Store right out of the box
gigahertz Network because we can't pick up that 5 gigahertz but loading everything
it is pretty clear for what it is though so like
keep in mind this is Geekbench four and not Geekbench five
seven actually comes ahead in single and multi and the fire
seven is a very low-end tablet to begin with so as for the Wi-Fi speeds
I wanted to test out some native Android gaming pub G call of duty
even minecraft was a bit slow on this tablet and by the way
this is only the very beginning of the game as you build your farm up
there'll be more assets on screen and the lag will get worse
we're getting a hundred percent speed-up in the top left hand corner
but it's got a really really high price tag now in the next coming days
CPU I tested in a cheaper Android smartphone recently and performance was actually decent
G minecraft at full speed and not to mention emulation PSP Dreamcast PlayStation
does it ask for credit card details debit card details or any details whatsoever
there's the camera and that's the speaker you turn it on on the side
so let's turn it on voila so you're greeted too a wallpaper
now i've already created elias's account my little boys account now over here
they're missing oh there's only five but when you click on them
each one of these contain a number of books for definite so you see
it's actually costs a bit of money on other platforms avalanche puddle
let's go back to home screen all right so your games are in there
plus the books are fantastic for reading to him or her
hey let me just get a book up here all right
if you can't read for some particular reason you can actually get them to read
okay let me see if i can find a different one
um come on where the reading books actually do read to you
no he's not olaf is special because he sees the best in everyone
this tablet is fantastic for anyone that fears android devices or ios devices
they have no idea about quality price they have no idea about brands
i hope you enjoy that and i hope you buy one of these
you can actually take it everywhere you go and it's pretty
it's nice to see a usb c port and mini hdmi
probably already wondering if you can hide the hardness behind the screen
now it's time to start our stopwatch for the boot time
everyone has 7 seconds in their life to wait for this unit to boot up
you need to install car av assistant app on your phone
please let me know in the comments and in the communication settings screen
wireless apple carplay and android auto which is pretty pretty good
i'm going to give you guys an in-depth review of the remarkable paper tablet 2.
it's nice to see they've updated the design quite a bit
it's much thinner and it just feels like a more premium device
so the remarkable is designed as a note-taking and writing device
uh you can have like your main view of listed files right here
but it doesn't have like a web browser anything like that
go through the remarkable account so it does require remarkable count
so let's go ahead and load up just the regular pencil so it supports
uh into you know typed text so it does require an internet connection
i was kind of messing around with some different things here
so let's talk about the interface a little bit more again
the top to add new folders new notebooks new quick sheets
you can set a passcode to turn the device on and on for added security
it does support a number of languages for that handwritten conversion feature uh
it's a little bit more basic but you got to understand
it doesn't have any like inverted mode or anything like that
where you can send web articles to the remarkable to read them reformatted
it doesn't seem to work quite as well but it is an option
this is the older ipad though with the uh original apple pencil
i don't know how the newer one is and another advantage with the ink
thank you guys for watching check out the ebookreader.com for more info bye
I thought having a non IPS display wouldn't be a problem
you can also place an intent mode and tablet mode to suit your need
there wasn't much of a delay when typing except one backspacing
sometimes there's a capacitive touch pad on the bottom and it's okay
you can use two fingers to scroll up or down on a page
microUSB and DC port to use either one to charge the tablet a mini HDMI
it's made of just plastic all around and it's pretty thick and heavy
Mally 450 MPEG pu and it's near stock android 6.0 marshmallow
one of the best things about this tablet is its battery life
size does matter and the keyboard is suitable for almost anyone for $100
I'll have links down in the description and as always thanks for watching you
hey everyone this is a review for the here on campus
besides the important things you also get pen nibs and a screen cleaner
the holder isn't really a necessity but as I often lose my pen
you were also given extra pen nibs if your pen gets too stubby
loaded the g21 nine driver and not the gt1 nine one version two driver
it's nice to have such a big screen to zoom into details
partial options are also a lot more self-explanatory and understandable in comparison to where
I expected but I can't alter alternate alternate our script okay
the problems are encountered which a few can be easily words around
then getting a tablet and monitor from the same company would be wise another minor
Windows so if you're planning on using only using the monitor screen
it may be a problem if you want to type for improvements
I would add an eraser to the end of this pen
I've used it with non drawing software like Camtasia Studio Google
I want to thank you one for this opportunity for viewing that tablet
it's been an honor to use and review this tablet and
please consider it if you're in the market for a monitor so again thank you
i will be revisiting the lg g pad 5 10.1 tablet
so let's kim and keep it moving into the video as usual
you can slap the device onto your equipment payment plan and pay 1250 a month
and i love it when engineers fuse metal into their devices
there is a 5 megapixel camera on the back side of the g pad
5 there is an 8 megapixel camera and just out of pure curiosity
the sim tray along with the sd card is located on the left
the g-pad 5 has a 10.1 edge-to-edge full hd lcd display at 1920x1200
the device is running an overweight version of android 9 aka
the lg g pad five floors is a quad core snapdragon 821 processor
this processor was the to have however in comparison to today's processing power
at best the device has 4 gigabytes of ram with 32 gigabytes of internal memory
also the g-pad 5 has expandable storage up to 512 gigabytes
i've got to mention this real fast before i continue folks
alright folks that is a wrap for the lg g-pad 5 10.1
it really does help out the channel and also consider subscribing
it also has bluetooth for external headsets keyboards and other accessories
so let's take a look at the tablet in greater detail
there's nothing else remarkable about the front if we turn it to the side
first thing you'll see at the top is the power button
then you'll see the volume rocker up and down and then towards the bottom here
this thing supports up to 32 gig card slot to the manufacturer
then you see the headphone jack to the right and then another
so as you'll see there i have the google play store
i can look at apps and see what apps are available
i can go to the free section and obviously as you can see
part me hour battery life and I can honestly say that
so they're of no use to me unfortunately along with that
data transfer or you could use it for wired tethering a number of different options
I haven't tried it so I can attest to the functionality okay
so let's look at this thing in operation a little bit more
you know the responsiveness of this thing is just been amazing
it is never stalled or stuttered or giving me one glitch whatsoever
as a matter of fact overall the tablet has done nothing but impress me
this is a screen capture button so it automatically captures your screen for you
and then there's a menu button down here which in certain situations provides functionality
ok folks you could go out and spend two three or even four times
by saying the gear best is brought to droidforums.net an impressive array of products
but a whole plethora of other gear that would be worthy of your consideration
I suggest you at least take a look at their offerings
I hope you've enjoyed my review of the tech glass tpad x98 air 3g tablet
this is fox cat signing off and remember to visit the gear
the act of drawing area is fifteen point nine inches by 10 inches
it has a TFT LCD screen with a screen resolution of 1440 by 900 pixels
the tablet has 2048 levels of pressure as well as 5080 lines per inch
here's a couple of my own opinions while the tablet came with a vga cable
I went ahead and used a DVI input to experience the best quality
that's one of the few things that really dates us over
the tablets display leans towards a cooler tone when set to default
I will show you a comparison between the monitor and tablet screens
I thought this would bother me while working on it since
I'm typically used to matte screen protectors but I was pleasantly surprised
I personally love the design weight and feel of this pen
making it very comfortable to draw while the tablet is upright
the pen is hold a charge for a good length of time since
Photoshop and I didn't have any trouble with pressure sensitivity or straight lines
jitter on the diagonal lines which is great and I didn't just go
it looks like you can't change those buttons to a keystroke at all like
well it's a little bit older than most on the market
It’s a tablet that tries very hard to be a laptop and it’s undoubtedly unique
The first thing that pictures don’t show you is that the Surface is big.
It’s certainly not a Retina Display but the saturation and black levels are top notch.
The rear camera is tilted downward which takes a bit of getting used to
and on the right is the charging port, USB 2.0 and Micro HDMI.
It feels very well built and closes with a nice snap but it’s not adjustable.
Hidden behind the kickstand is a MicroSD card slot which supports cards up to 64GB.
The Surface RT runs Windows RT which is Windows 8 for ARM processors.
The biggest downside is the fact that you lose all compatibility with legacy Windows apps.
No Google Chrome, no Battlefield 3 and no Photoshop are available on the Surface RT.
At times the Surface feels like a glimpse into the future
Compare that with $399 for the Nexus 10 and $499 for the iPad 4
Feel free to check out more videos on the Surface here and hit up that

skin repair strengthens the skin barrier and boasts antioxidant levels in the skin
hydration helps fades carrying and improve evenness of the skin tone
pounds making it a bit heavier than most the tablets that are out there
now if we talk about ergonomics and how this thing feels in your hand overall
the one nice thing about this tablet is at the back
and then right next to it is a orientation lock located just to the top
side of the device contains a small locking switch on the opposite side
now let's get into some of the serious stuff in terms of technical specifications
which is clocked in one gigahertz and has one megabyte of l2 cache memory
and it's capable of replicating 16 million colors in terms of how this display
i managed to get an average of six to seven hours of battery life
it has a good management system for you to do that
if i had to complain with anything i would say that
you can take a standard hdmi port directly connected into your tv and directly
connect it into the toshiba thrive and basically right then and there mirror your display
if you can slim it down make it a little more linear
let me know in the comments down below or message us on youtube as well
so thank you so much and we'll see you next time take care
Photoshop let me go ahead and click one of these really quick
it had features a great price range at around just a hundred dollars u.s. dollars
everybody gets LAN Seidman and we're checking out a really odd computer from Acer today
it's got a 1920 by 1080 display really good viewing angles on it
but it has 8 gigs of ram and a 256 gigabyte
now you'll see here that we've got it in kind of its hybrid mode here
and it'll almost dock itself it just snaps into place on its own
what they have done is put in one of these little pointer
you have a power and standby button as well as a micro
I should note that the speakers are in the front here
they can be loud enough to project what you want to project out of it
I think it has wireless AC onboard and it definitely supports the 5 gigahertz
it is able to make adjustments on the fly here very quickly
give or take when you're doing basic work tasks like productivity
Core M machines at this price point because are gonna perform about the same
a lot of people are buying this specifically for the gaming features
and it's really good at that but if you know me
it's not the best build in the world but you can see it's it's solid
this is one of a few tablets just a few with front-facing speakers
I mean this isn't even a premium price tablet it's pretty mid-range and these speaker
Android with a few Nvidia improvements and I really like that
so it's pretty sharp but again the panel is just mid-range
Android tablet lags and stutters and drop streams like crazy and that's Google Earth
almost zero dropped frames beautiful fluid movement might actually finally be the first
yes they added a stylus to the back of this tablet
NVIDIA has added to the stock Android experience was some performance modes and
there's also in the quick settings a toggle for full screen mode which is basically
I think they'll also get a few software updates maybe see Android L soon
thanks for watching guys and I'll talk to you in the next one peace
I picked one of these up and I tuned my car with it
the short answer is yes but more power is a little misleading for contacts
the car is so much more fun to drive but now moving on
and that's the point as you can see a new open
and seventy five abducts six hundred seventy five dollar price tag comes from the
I just don't think it's worth it and an even better news
you might not even have to pay five hundred dollars for your open
just a few other things before we go on discuss the things
I would have hoped for something that didn't look like it came out of 2005
open it up with the software download the actual tune file
it's clunky it's outdated and it's a pile of talk garbage
actually edit the tune files itself that process is probably one of the worst things
my car's torque tip is almost completely gone so just putting it out there
this thing paired with an aftermarket header will nearly get rid of your torque dip
this is their debut version and right now they're currently on the version
it writes faster but it doesn't actually affect the tune file itself
it has 8192 levels of pen pressure to ensure that your lines look crisp
the cool thing about this tablet is that it also works with android phones
i almost always have a pretty clear idea of what i'll be doing before
whatever is relevant to what you're gonna make once you know what you're gonna do
make sure everything's consistent and then go back to add features along with this
i didn't sketch a background here because the background was already drawn for this
since it's part of an animation meme but my point still stands at this stage
for making your animations look real nice is to animate on an arc
that talk about arcs already on youtube and i totally recommend looking so up after
the reason i'm saying this is because it kind of depends on how you work
that's what i did and it was worth it aside from all the shortcut
i also have an iphone so i can't really use it anyway overall
if you're in the market for a new tablet i totally recommend it
especially if you're looking for a tablet with lots of shortcut options for faster drawing
your animation will look nice and smooth even if the drawing itself isn't perfect
invert the selection and erase out the part of the gradient
alright that about sums up how i animate or at least how i animate ghost
it's actually two-sided i'll show you the other side in a minute
you can program the area to be smaller if you want to
i'm in there so it's not gonna work on there on the bottom
i've got shift e which is a raise on the software so with this
we need to get the color picker back and then pencil
we go look at that and let's just do a bit there
um can i pick a one pencil fill in the gap easy color picker green
oh there no no undo undo there now we're getting somewhere okay
i've drawn it better before waiting just a little bit there
i just wanted to show you how easy it is to do
you can fill up the whole screen look for bread and then delete it
it's probably gonna be an amazon affiliate link um and okay
we're gonna start with the unboxing we've got a QuickStart guide that basically explains well
then we've got a power button volume up and volume down as well
there is nothing on the sides and then on the back
we've got this rubberized back over plus the 8 megapixel camera as well
then we've got the digital and well being parent course parental controls
sorry pictures and videos if it finds that we don't browse them anymore
obviously the font size ended display size is fully adjustable to your liking
Mouse support something that Apple just recently released with their iPads
well you've got the auto correction you've got the spellcheck you've got you can count
you then game on it ends because the second 10 inch device it actually
so yeah thanks for watching out there episode of quick expert reviews and
I'm Erin from tech gadgets Canada calm and the Amazon fire
it's bigger than the 8 and it has a more widescreen format
I don't know how well you're gonna be able to see that there
YouTube so what's the difference between a Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 10
but the voice control option wasn't working and nor was show mode
I do think the video can be a bit dark and watching very dark scenes
I quickly added Spotify YouTube Netflix in - Graham Twitter and Google keep
so that was a nice surprise now disappointingly audible is still not available in Canada
I also couldn't see things like Canadian banking apps or Canadian news apps
I would upgrade to the ten you can read the full review of this tablet
that helps us keep making more videos that we hope everyone out
YC you can also find me on facebook comm slash tech gadgets canada
you might ask why would I get this instead of a Cintiq
the quality is hit or miss after using this tablet for a few weeks
Cintiq tablet the Wacom that I'm used to is the slightly older 12 inch version
so that's going to give me a little variation in this review
the buttons are much better than I expected any of the cheaper Cintiq alternatives
that are out there right now have some flaws to them
you'll find things like dust under the screen or dead pixels
I missed was being able to pinch in order to zoom in and out
a lot of those types of things like the pressure sensitivity is also adjustable
not because of the pen and that's the way it should be one thing
the stand is an extra fifty dollars but it's kind of Awesome
yep now I got the drivers up and running on both Mac and Windows
it's not going to work on the surface tablet that's okay
I had some Wacom drivers installed but I didn't actually notice any conflict
Pixelmator that I was playing with on the Mac less than other programs
El Capitan never gets old when I first took it out
my hand just didn't feel quite right on the pen screen
this is a great device often times when you look at
Wacom competitors you're sacrificing something to get that lower price but with the artisan v13
I'm working on a review for app for the ipad called meaty bang mehdi bang
hello internet world and welcome to my review of the veek vk 1200.
this is a pen display or graphics tablet with a really good ips display
this was very kindly sent in free of charge by the manufacturer
this is really nice very very comfortable to hold nicely tapered at the top
but normally i'd have this lane flat on the desk now
the vk 1200 measures 318 by 289 by just 12 millimeters thick
that you're using of course within the application also worth noting
they've done a great job on how this pen interacts with the vk
why would you want a graphics tablet or a display like this
well you can of course get graphics tablets that allow you to do drawing
you get some disconnection there being able to draw directly onto the image
let me just change colors here just so you can see a bit clearer
it's just a fantastic experience being able to draw direct onto the display
i've really been impressed with is the price point on the vk 1200
if you want to pick up a vk 1200 for yourself
it's essentially like drawing on a business card as I said earlier
meaning you can only use the side of the pen with a nuke
whenever you buy the tablet the last thing is the court
I'll go ahead and give it the biggest drawback the dragger
this thing is pinky it seems to hate most pcs while working relatively smooth on
I admit I'm pretty spoiled by my team to his pro
maybe not unless you have the patience to get the drivers working
but they're releasing their first tablet and that company is named senslab
the section for the tablet does have a nice silky cushioned
that's going to protect your tablet on the go from there
stylus one skinny one with two buttons and one thicker tapered one with three buttons
it's an all metal build and a very premium matte drawing surface to draw on
and you can customize them to your heart's content from there
a lock so that you can lock it and secure it to a desk now
the rgb lights that are on the the tablet itself which is kind of cool
and then you can diagnose and see how heavy your pen pressure is
i'm excited to see what they have coming down the pipeline in the future
this might not be in your price bracket and that's okay
like and subscribe and i will talk to you guys later
uh wherever you guys are at whenever you guys are at have a good night
and this is my review for the tech class p80x android tablet
i'm going to skip showing you the formalities of the setup process
but this is the very first tablet review for me so i wondered
we have geekbench running here which is a well-respected benchmarking application
any small text or images can be enlarged with multi-touch screen gestures
hello this is simracing corner and this is my review racing um to me
you'll need to excuse my bad gameplay as it was a difficult filming angle
he was standing too close to a power conduit from the laser blockade
luckily it doesn't have any orders concerning you so it let you go
that's all the game testing over and finally testing the camera
i think what tech class have done here is really good
and i think they've really managed to do this very very well for me
World Congress actually starts but that's okay of course I can do that
Cree do because this is very very dialed back and muted
basically it's just a as you can see a black rectangle up here
you have nothing but this plastic edge surprisingly not very scratched
that came out with a set three phone so that works very well
because if you hold this your hand will probably cover the speakers
I don't know why they put to speak is down here
there's another design feature that is worth notice noticing and that is around this edge
I weighed mine the other day and it was 370 grams
i have a magazine of the kind i usually buy when
so set for tablet is it is better than a magazine
screen triluminos display with x-reality engine triluminos and x-reality are basically buzzwords created by
so it's pretty high resolution and it looks absolutely gorgeous to me
it never had any problems with overheating or stuttering or anything like that
so i'm guessing sony did something with the heat dissipation and it worked very well
the LTE version is slightly heavier but still not very heavy at all
this is the Xperia set for screen as you can see
it's sufficient to say that it is a very nice screen
it is not a super amoled that like the Samsung screens which means my opinion
I never had any reason to feel with those settings at all
it's got the Snapdragon 810 SOC which is a very good cpu or SOC
Sony's said 3 + / set for phone but with this
I'm saying that now but it's not available for Android all right here
I played this before so I actually know what I'm doing and I was well
I don't really like the racing games and stuff like that
this is the 810 chipset as I said it doesn't get very warm at all
it gets a bit warm ish up here in this area
I can't help but wonder what should suddenly do to improve on this
they can change the vessels because the vessels are quite distinct in
the same goes for the chipsets if they upgrade from the 810
that already is almost perfect and I think that's a problem with sewing these days
they can only do incremental steps which means that it won't be a new flagship
they tried adding the fingerprint sensor for the set 5 phone
in my opinion that wasn't very successful kind of ruined this very nice
so hmm we'll certainly pull out of the tablet the sea possibly actually
I think it's possible that they will at least take a timeout
and say we're not going to do this for a while
due by the cell phone tablet it is a very good tablet
it becomes pretty apparent that you know you can upgrade the SOC
the thing is though playing xcom enemy within on this works brilliantly
I think that tablets are even phones are diminishing in sales these days
SOC why should I upgrade it why should I pay you know five six hundred
sorry about the reflectiveness woke up because it is a flush screen of bezel
you have a kind of nice hard rubber plastic volume up and down power button
that's awesome camera as I said you don't have a light package
the front is flush screen a bezel with a camera on the front
a cat at the foot of your bed is on fire
you can plug this into your headphone jack auxilary jackal via the headphone jack
in your car and you can listen to stuff that you go
we're on a web browser now and you can do shopping from there
look library is where all your stuff is actually going to be
this will be your books your magazines your little kids books everything
yes swipe left and right you can do all that stuff thank you very much
everything changes live for the most part you have margins line spacing justification
you can push everything to the left box it in the middle and so forth
jump to page add bookmarks find in book view details and settings
just kind of like your feed and then at the bottom
that's really cool and then everything will just be down here more by this artist
more in the series editorial reviews you can do review and click
you can also click free sample if you want to do that
like you know what page 45 will be the the ad for this particular thing
cool you can zoom in on that you can double tap out
this is kind of small even if you compare it against like my experience d3
the the tablet itself is capable of a lot of things
this is a great tablet since then tablets have kind of caught up with themselves
there's a lot to cover for nook stuff trigger e-reader comm this is Peter
it's a monitor that needs to be connected to a computer to work
you can use and set up as shortcuts in there is also a rotating
that's pretty small and compact it can be adjusted from 14 degrees to 45 degrees
I don't know if it depends on the screen protector or the tip itself
so it's nice that they reduced them so it's great for portability
the lamination of this screen is really good the parallax it's barely noticeable
before was the comparison between the other fifteen point six inches display tablet
I am trying to experiment with ways of coloring especially digitally
I haven't made a watercolor illustration since the beginning of the year
it looks like it just made a mistake and I mean Anatomy
I feel quite confident about the female torso but everything else
also you know guy said his channel started with me only making
thank you so much for watching and I hope you're all safe
we could flash the car back to 100% stock at any time for a dealer
1 tune writing a tune to your vehicle takes about 5 minutes
we notice the engine to be smoother all throughout the rev band and at idle
really this is how we think the BRZ should feel from the factory
but it's very brief and much improved over stock on the stock tune
we'd say we're really happy with the car just on the stage one two
then pull over and flash the ECU to the e85 tune
so you're breaking even if not saving money at the pump
it's our first time drifting ever so go easy on us
now you may think that because he's got a mobile processor
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how fast the laptop actually is
Boots's straight into windows ready feeding used so there we go
you're at your Windows desktop so it comes with Windows 10 professional

I'm bringing you a review of the Wacom Bamboo fun pen and touch
let's look at the system preferences for this bamboo pen and touch tablet now
we can configure the buttons on the pen the eraser feel double-click distance etc
and then we can configure the tablet itself either left or right-handed use
it still work with the pain but just won't accept a touch input
you can tap with one finger as I've been doing already
I was on so very useful for actually navigating around a browser
I'm viewing so I can double click to view this photo
it takes a little bit of getting used to that first
Thunderer pen and touch features in one device is a very welcome addition

this video review is sponsored by crucial the memory experts they provide reliable
PC notebook and Mac memory to boost your system performance and improve your general workflow
recently I was contacted by a spokesperson from a company called Galman
they offered to send me a free fancy-pantsy tablet in order to review it
doing a basic review wasn't really gonna cut it for me so instead
so it's quite the upgrade from my huion h6n pro the gigantic package
the goal is to make flaming knuckles a little more unique first
I started incorporating the angular pattern into other parts of the design knuckles as ancestors
have these sort of markings on their face and dreads dr.
I made the Lego base and the shackles a sort of silvery gray
I've heard this is actually kind of normal with screen tablets anyway
I left links in the description of where you can buy it
I hope you guys enjoyed this redesign - if I get another sponsorship like this
some of you might actually already know what it might be
I hope you look forward to that and I'll see you guys later
yeah why don't you take it you all compared to the other ones yeah
it's kind of an all-in-one cable and let me show this to you
I use them on my laptop there's one two and then the the HDMI right
it's very very easy to connect this tablet to your computer now
it's not very big but it is a great tablet to have like
I've yet to find another brand that performs quite like like a Wacom
does you know there's zero jitter that even when you're zipping right along
let's pick a little watercolor here and see what we can do
I said it performs just like bigger wacom unit for a fraction of the price
I mean I think this is probably the most affordable Wacom tablet on the market
I like about the walk comes is you can push a little bit harder
you can make the pencil blood bigger if you want it
yeah see if you push harder you can necessarily draw on for real and
yeah well you didn't actually use the pencils whole white color pencil
I didn't realize this unit didn't have an eraser I want to erase
I also own a 13-inch Wacom Cintiq tablet 8g tablet and the performance is comparable
it's made of metal but that doesn't mean that the one is cheap
it is walking so you know you're gonna get the performance that you want
you can slip this unit into a laptop bag and take it with you like
Wacom if you're looking for more art and animation videos subscribe to clownfish animation

yes over the fire seven but you are getting a bit of a bigger device
life has also increased from about 8 hours to about 12 hours
the speaker has been improved going from a single mono speaker to a dual dolby
there's a web browser called silk email maps contacts calendar calculator
and when it comes to audio you have that three-and-a-half millimeter headphone jack
if you use other power adapters that you may already have lying around
and that's supposed to give you about 12 hours of battery life now
I can actually see my Fire HD tablet inside the Alexa app on my iPhone
I was really surprised by how much I liked this tablet
I'm Erin you can find me on Twitter or Instagram until the next video
it's slightly more tricky to draw on to a smaller surface
one of the cheaper stuff seen at around 30 pound $30
that you've all been asking me about the lenovo duet chromebook
it's colorful it gets surprisingly bright at 372 nits and it
i still think it performs better than you'd expect from those specs
it actually looks like a lot of the other reviewers shared my experience
but the one that i ordered actually did not arrive prior to this video
there are speakers they produce some sound and that is all that's same
i actually think the build of this device is pretty cool
i love love that all the accessories are magnetic like the keyboard
i know you only come here for the incredible sense of humor
this is the part where i make an awful joke about this
you know dongle adapter so you can plug headphones into it
if you made it this far it means that you like the content
whatever so that i can go home and just smile all week long
however if you can afford that many devices that are frivolous like that
thank you as always for watching and i'll see you next time
that was sent in to me by my friends at gearbest
the pipo w2s has an 8 inch screen as 1920 by 1200 pixels display
L the 8 inch screen is 283 PPI and it is an IPS
okay so it's just have a bit of an update today
okay so here we are in the Android settings storage and you can see there
it doesn't have a hard drive and it is as e
that ok will boot into Windows and where we go okay
here is the little tablet on gear bests own site and you can see
you can't get it in black it's available while it looks things
don't really need this charger because you can actually use any standard
it wasn't the latest of what is the other 1701 or something
the latest one or 17 11 is the latest operating system so
it does make it very very difficult to be honest with you guys
here it comes here we go so you can start a new project
seven one gigabytes of free space on a nineteen point seven gigabytes all right
so this is the stills side of things and we can take his snap so
let's compare it with a 10 inch my 10 inch as you can see
you've got one small enough to actually plug in to the little pepo
alright let's plug it in and give it a go there we go
you can also run this little tablet as a proper PC with a keyboard
hopefully we should be off then to gearbest there we are
so you can only know this is only a small little bluetooth keyboard
Bluetooth keyboard here but there are some larger ones and much better ones out there
and whatever you on it which would be a lot easier to operate
it'll still work the same for you guys for a future project for this
remove the box out of the way and here we go this is it
there's no problem there as you can see and obviously it moves around as well
it was working earlier on hence they at the time and everything
okay thanks a lot of stuff so as you can see up here
obviously this is where it's aimed so let's just come out of there
it's already got a pre-loaded audio thing for you just to see screens
that's good as well so again for you as the parent
you've got your music normal setting is for Android flow those to your heart's content
you can put anything you want in and the main thing is you can have
it'll take you back if you get it right once obviously
fantastic for you to pick up and play with many trials an avenue
Buy and the specs of it are a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor
it feels like a nice weight not too heavy not too light
you can find it on amazon for fifty to sixty dollars
i've seen the prices change a few dollars here and there
this is the pen that it comes with on the side of the pen
click on the lock and give the huion tablet permission and then it will work
it was on five percent so that was probably another reason
i feel way more comfortable and i could do that online
better and faster than i did in this time lapse so yes just practice
i also was having trouble because i haven't used photoshop too much
you can also connect to your phone if you have an android
the cursor is only visible on some devices like on the galaxy note
so if you have that this might be a great option
also keep in mind if you connect it to your phone
you're not going to be able to use the whole tablet workspace to draw
on mouse you can use it on sketchbook ebs pane etc
otherwise lepen tablet PC is a pretty generic device in terms of specs
actually used the same charger is a little bit shady to be honest now
we haven't heard a lot of here in the United United States and the TC
the tablet itself which is very reflective is a huge fingerprint
it's made out of glass in the front and the size of ice are embezzled
here you can see the serious speakers which are very loud
is it hold switch a volume rocker as long as a micro
you have the browser the calendar the camera Google Maps of course in Gmail
now for some weird reason even though the device does have a 2 gigabyte
it's just a smartphone operating system being stretched onto a larger screen
just click on that and see how fast it loads now over
Wi-Fi it is pretty speedy as far as the reception goes
it doesn't have only three axes but actually all four axes which is pretty impressive
see here that multi-touch is also a pretty smooth experience overall
if you're gonna be again browsing the web or viewing content
we also liked how the controls on the side of the device
PC running Android OS because unlike sits unlike the resolution of sixteen by nine
the 8-inch Walmart tablet has an IPS display with a resolution of 1280 by 800
some beta but this device has a lot going for it
you're not gonna get any skinned experiences like the Amazon fire devices
it's the same company it's kind of like the Costco of Walmart
sometimes there's a little sticker on it and it'll give you a digital code
you go online and there you go you have a digital copy via the
you can also bookmark at the top little page curls over to show
so they have basically a mobile version tapping into their website
there's just the single on the back but the volume capacity is quite good
this really gives you a sense on the vibrancy of the screen
Gray's when you look at a black spot yeah so this is guided view
well you're not gonna really kind of get like a full
dude everybody's using the iPad pro nail artist is I would god Rafi stop
I want to draw something that I might use in a comic book page
I want it to be good enough to show in my portfolio
I could jump in and get really granular with the design
we're gonna have to go online and find the drivers also pen
so that gives you the idea of how small of an area
I draw a line if I draw a tiny little line on this tablet
I did to offset that is in my drawing program eyes oome the way in
the other thing that happens on a smaller tablet like this is
I needed to do now once I got to the colouring phase
I don't exactly want it to look like a silhouette perfectly
I wouldn't know that this wasn't done on an iPad or larger Cintiq tablet
I wanted to thank you guys for watching to the end
I really appreciate it and I'll see you in a couple of days
1560 is a middle-of-the-road pen display drawing tablet in terms of price features and size
Galman and I got into contact with each other about me
I accepted the deal and had them send me the tablet to review it arrived
eight replacement pen nibs which are stored in the pen holder
I'm confident that I can scratch at it as hard as I can
and nothing bad will happen definitely a lot more secure than no protector at all
it's sturdy and holds the tablet firmly in place under pressure
now bear in mind that my actual artistic abilities are not good they are bad
this tablet is super overpowered for anything that I do with it overall
oh it boasts all the pressure sensitivity 8,000 levels response rate and so forth
if that makes sense it just felt right and natural and it was really fluid
they sometimes don't have the ability to change that you can program your buttons
they don't seem to be able to do that the ones I've seen anyway
I always seem to forget that but check that out and see what you think
Pro which is lovely but in terms of the Wacom tablets
I haven't used a modern one so I can't properly compare but I don't
I haven't heard that they've done anything new in special words
this surface does seem to be that much nicer it was very very fluid
it's hard and firm and it just it glides it's nice it is like a
it comes in a beautiful box and it's got this huge case for the pen
and it's not those sort of things you want to worry about
this like this for your left hand is and so forth
hello you lovely lot and welcome to a new video today
this is just gonna be my full and honest opinion of the product
Katy 16 is a screen tablet with an active screen area measuring 15.6 inches
and they're stupid so don't mind that that's not anything to do with the tablet
there isn't any assembly required with this tablet because the stand came already attached
so this is where my main issue with this tablet came in on right-handed use
I did initially try this out on my mum's laptop because I found too late
I've used so you kind of have to have a light hand with this tablet
the surface of this tablet or rather the screen protector felt very nice to use
and it had a subtle grip and the pen didn't slide around so generally
this tablet said that they were impressed with the lack of parallax
it's basically the distance of the cursor from the pen tip itself so
and it was very comfortable to use and it turned with a nice solid
the side of the tablet is also handy for storing the pen
I used my simplest cell shading style which utilizes fairly sharp
you get a lot of tablet for the price and know it has its moments
and then there's Rafe in the colored illustration who is from my fantasy novel breakwater
so they're both very good boys but one is significantly smarter than the other
I really hope this video is useful to you and that you enjoyed watching it
here's a quick size comparison with a white gel pen that I have
unlike other stylus pens that you need to plug in to charge
this doesn't require any charging and it has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity and two
these sorts of tablet screens do require a fair amount of different cables
fancy as you can see the pressure sensitivity was really great
I found the 15.6 inch screen size to be perfect for me
XP pen makes a variety of different screen sizes and price points
it's an extra but they do have one if the necessary for you
I didn't find it a problem to work flat when I'm drawing normally
it's also quite easy to have a little mobility now that said
I've tried before it's this similar size to a regular pen like I showed earlier
this is great for me because I have quite small hands and my hands
my hand can get strained and tired from holding the larger sized pens and
I also really liked the no charging required function of this pen
it had a really long lag and it was glitching all over the place when
so if you're having any issues then getting the latest driver may solve them
helpful thanks again to XP pen for letting me try the tablet out
android tablet the s7 the matrix pad and it's from um thank you
it looks like they have a pre-installed kid ass apps on it
so this is the volume the power button and the reset button and up here
you have the um the usb port the memory slot the headphone jack
it's a usb core charger and just go back into the tablet to charge
google play that's the pre-installed apps we're going to show you later
here's um voice call and here you have photos drive movie maps and gmail
everything arrived nicely packaged and the first thing I found was this drawing glow
and the tablet itself safe and sound and this clear packaging below that
I'm gonna be testing this tablet on my Mac laptop with Photoshop CC
the tablet is right around $120 and the design is really nice
it's made of quality materials and has these smooth rounded edges
the pin pressure felt perfect for me and my light-handed touch
the tablet is 11 inches by 6 point 8 7 inches and
there are eight customizable shortcut keys and I was able to easily program
I think it's a solid option for beginners intermediate artists or even advanced artists
I want to talk about the XP pengie 430 gaming tablet
a pen tip remover and a quick guide here are some specs
it works on Mac and Windows and it's usable with both right and left hand
the driver has many options such as change the active area
you want to use the tablet on and disabled buttons on the pen
though there was one problem which was you cannot disable the pen tip
the back of the tablet has four rubber stops which prevents it from slipping
and now you might be wondering what's that black spot okay so this is what
it's even lighter than the into the thickness of the pen is also very comfortable
that was that if you accidentally click on one of the buttons while you're playing
USB connection so if you by any way damage the cable oh well
if it doesn't work anymore you have to get a new tablet and now
Gulman a 56k or something like that but I really recommend this tablet
be a rebel like me and buy the salad instead of the curry on 4/20
I'm going to be reviewing a tablet that I got from cam on the graphics
Start Guide it's a Quick Start Guide ok when I first opened it
and it comes with the screwdriver to screw on the stand onto your tablet
quit it and in this tiny box if I could get it open
gosh finally the pen finally underneath all of that is the actual tablet itself
wow it has ten shortcut keys and five menu keys anyway
there's this matte screen projector on it and you can take it off
it has all the instructions on how to like screw stand on the back
these are all the cores that you need and the two on the right
USB port whatever here I just show you how to take the nibs out
there are eight replacement nibs if yours ever get worn down
the pen has over 8,000 levels of pen pressure which is very nice
I've ever drawn on this and I use this all the time
oh if you're left-handed on the menu you can just flip everything 180 degrees
I'm still putting some new stuff on there but for now
but so thank you very much for being very patient with me
so this smart tablet by alcatel has a simple and ergonomic design
mm audio jack usb type c port and the sd card slot yes
screen hd tab with 1280 by 800 resolution at 151 ppi
octa-core mt-8167 chipset with two gigs of ram and 32 gigs of internal storage
it has two speaker grilles which provide a loud and strong sound
the other person was not feeling any difference in calls as well
i say having a laptop and a tablet at this price is rare
it supports a very high resolution screen and sports a Super AMOLED screen
for example we have this hand con office suit which is a replacement for Microsoft
I did not even have four problems loading very heavy websites on this tab
I noticed art on the Chrome web browser specifically the experience was not that smooth
the blacks are inky blacks and the contrast level is also excellent
we also have the fingerprint scanner which is embedded within the home button
so if you have a Samsung based Android smartphone with the Wi-Fi direct
so even folding in a single hand is a decent experience
I hope that you found this video review helpful if you found it helpful
and if you're not subscribed to my youtube channel subscribe to the same
so we have an artist glue that's included and this is the tablet
that tells you where you can download the driver the USB cable
just that it feels a bit hollow two side buttons here and a grip section
let's take a look at the tablet itself now in an earlier video
we have 12 physical shortcut buttons on the left and it's very thin on back
I'm using Windows now and I've just installed a Windows driver
so this is where it can customize the pen to side buttons and pressure sensitivity
this is where you can customize the twelve physical shortcut buttons
let's see what you can assign to each physical shortcut button
Windows ink let me turn on Windows ink and try it again alright
I don't have any major issues except for the usual Photoshop
the shock cut so now redo it's working fine this buttons
they have very nice firm feedback this is MIDI bang paint Pro okay
this is way more responsive compared to Photoshop and pressure sensitivity works really
which is great has tried a transition from thin to thick
so let me just zoom down a bit and try again all right now
quita is also of very responsive app by the way this drawing tablet
um it's one of those where there is no screen on the tablet
so you have to actually look at your display and draw nowadays when
let me just draw my daughter who is now almost two years
oh so this is her playing with her toys in the morning clip studio paint
this review will not be complete without me showing you how it performs on
size windows driver works fine just that with Mac OS driver
the pen is sensitive and accurate and drawing performance with the various drawing software that
i wouldn't recommend this tablet to make OS uses for the issues
you can find them through the links in the video description below
if you have any questions let me know in the comment section
Two packs of extra pen tips and a tip remover. Five foot long tablet cable.
Your device’s settings, system settings, or about page shows your version.
In this case the tablet works without having to do anything else.
Also, you can’t rotate your phone or tablet to draw in landscape mode.
First, uninstall any other tablet drivers. If you uninstall something, restart your computer.
Download the driver for Windows or Mac, depending on what you use.
you can have a size this tiny and still feel comfortable.
I don’t have a stylus for my phone, so I couldn’t compare that.
As for phone battery drain, it’ll vary depending on your phone and drawing app.
For me, using the tablet in Flipaclip cost 8% of battery charge per hour.
now the only other tablet that may be announced soon is the tab
for the eight inch model a nine point seven inch version comes in at 299
inches wide making this just big enough to be enjoyable but not too big where
but that's really being nitpicky on the aesthetics but now going around its physical features
SD card slot makes a return here offering up to 128 gigs of expandable storage
USB charging port with a 3 and 1/2 millimeter headphone input
it's not bad at all in hearing actor voices and sound effects
it is to be expected though on nearly every tablet then last year
there's nothing on the left side and nothing on the top
Android 5.0 on a Qualcomm apq 8016 running at 1.2 gigahertz on a quad-core processor
I believe but now let's take a look at the interface here
real quick smooth transitions swiping all the way to the left now features
the 1.5 gigs is very much 2013 maybe 2014 here spec requirements there and
we're not at the standard of at least two gigs or three gigs of RAM
2 gigs of RAM 77 percent increase in pixel density for sharper images and
comm you guys take care and I'll see you in the next one bye
so i enjoy the occasional game of elite dangerous and by occasional
that would help me out with this but i would need a tablet handily dragon
touch have been in touch and asked me to review one of their tablets
i'm not the only one with this keyboard shortcut problem if you look online
glass this is a free to download app for your phone and tablet you
you don't have to look something up and then look at your keyboard
it's actually quite smooth as you're scrolling through and the playback is also fine
on the tablet you can easily search for images type via the on-screen keyboard
the tablet's very good as well even if you're not using it for game glass
we're going to be checking out the five best budget tablets right now
be sure to check the links in the description below okay
the fifth product on our list is the amazon fire hd8
then the amazon fire hd 8 is a great budget option for you
it does feature their amazon kids mode for child safe content
you'll get about 12 hours of mix use dual 2 megapixel cameras
you can ask alexa to find information play videos or music or even open apps
the fourth product on our list is the lenovo tab m10 plus
you also get a kids mode which gives you a little more
which is something you don't normally find at this price range battery
but it's still easy to hold with even one hand while watching videos or reading
making it a great budget option for you especially if this is your first ipad
but what's also great about the ipad is that it's not only for entertainment
you can even connect a mouse or trackpad making your work
except there isn't anywhere to properly store your pencil when you're not using it
you'll love the incredible detail and vivid colors all day battery
you can expect up to 10 hours of mixed use a12 bionic chip
there's really nothing it can't do if you're on a tighter budget
the ipad delivers exceptional value and unmatched performance in an entry-level tablet
really gives it a premium look and feel without the premium price
a 10.1 with up to one terabyte of storage s pen included
hope to see you guys in the next video till next time
it's a very nice soft bag to hold the tablet in
the active area on this tablet is 9 by 6 inches
this makes it easier for your hand to uh glide across the tablet
you get the soft carrying bag to carry the tablet in which is really handy
I usually have a lot of problems when installing tablets on my computer
I think this one has 8 Express keys which is really cool
the tablet on the wireless setting for a little while for most of this picture
so this tablet is about half the price of other competing tablets overall
I really enjoyed working of the Hylian tablet and I think it worked very well
I would overall give the Helion tablet a 5 out of 5 stars
I think it worked very well and I really enjoyed my experience with it
thank you all so much for watching and I'll see you in my next video
Kabir solutions with a review of the HP Proust slate 12 Android tablet
which is where you can write on a paper notepad and it copies whatever
so just there's a standard kind of as you can see very good handwriting
maybe if it's a general use tablet that you after it's okay
it's got a clean and flat look and it takes portability seriously
but you still have front-facing stereo speakers flanking and on either side
unfortunately those aren't as loud as the iPad Air's the microUSB port and the audio
jack don't have any flaps protecting them but they are safely waterproof now
that's one thing that we were more than happy to test for the camera
Sony's Xperia UI has graduated to Android lollipop and the UI
the neverending live wallpaper and the side context menus you also get
there is no split screen mode for running two apps side-by-side
full-size light it's impossibly thin and light and it's also a pleasure to use
Lenovo let us borrow their tab to a ten tablet to check out today
but that's mainly because they put so much into the display
you like fruit ninja or something like that will be fine
here the standby button is there and that's pretty much it for ports
you've got an 8 megapixel camera so you can take some pictures you know
and while this is not a high-end gaming tablet it's certainly capable of running games
pretty well on here and I like to run the 3dmark benchmark
I can't really redesign S&T however I can redesign super SMT
it comes with two drawing gloves just in case you lose one
just something to consider if you want to buy this tablet all that aside
why don't we start test seeing this out by drawing something
I'm not sure why but I made it like flowy and angelic
it seems kind of silly now but I'm gonna leave this in the corner
user named in spaghetti sent me a redesign that they did very quickly
I really wanted S&T to have that super look in her hair
Sonic and shadows quills look so I did my best to capture that shape
I not only made her hair bigger but also point Z er
regular outfit but upgraded like if she had an evolution like a Pokemon
now let's move on to the coloring so my inspiration for the colors was that
I took the S&T reference and color shifted it until her hair
I did that her clothes turned blue and I really liked how that looked
I don't want to let it go to waste my Christmas
hey everyone sage here back again with another video and yes another tablet review
i'm proud to say that this video is brought to you by galman again
so let's open it up the first thing you will see after opening the box
the warranty card can be found right behind the thank you card
you have to open up the compartment first before getting the actual tablet inside it
i'm actually shocked that there is an artist's glove for this and the manual
i first tested this out with my android phone and it works perfectly fine though
according to the tablet model downloaded it and installed it in my computer
i was here and now you're telling me that it was not enough
come around will go through and forcing you to say i'm here for you
you know even if i'm not around you can wake me up
the express keys worked well too and i had no issues with this at all
you can get this tablet with a 28 off discount again
thank you so much for watching and i'll see you guys soon
where you're supposed to connect your tablet to your computer or your android iphone
i actually said iphone one at first i tested out the pho
g10 tee this is actually a wireless tablet for use with your computer
and this is the box with the pen case and the pen
so let me put this away to show you the actual tablet
at the back we have one solid piece of metal and the front
you will need to switch this on if you are charging it
but for some reason they appeared suddenly and some blemishes here as well
they do not work as well as I expect them to be
the working area of this tablet is 10 inches by 6 inches
and there is very little basil around the edges the top and the bottom
let's look at the pen case the pen and other accessories
there are two mannix here that closes the case tightly and this is the pen
and this is the wireless USB receiver to use the tablet in why this mod
so this area services for white aspect screens which most monitors are nowadays anyway
and here in this part you can actually rotate the tablet
I'm not going to show you how the tablet performs with various drawing apps
Sol and newer if you are using older Mac OS then
they are all in the text review that is on my blog
just visit the link in the video description below all right this is
Jeter in the line so for drawing in Photoshop I think it works quite well
meant for tablets but it's also available on the Mac desktop
the lines they taper quite well and now let me switch over to using mischeif
that's designed for the tablet so it supports all those features
I'm rotating right now using the trackpad clockwise and it does not work
I'm not familiar with this app so I'm just going to pick a default brush
Pro 10.2 you can produce unwanted splotches randomly often triggered by sudden change of pressure
to the text review so illustrator cs5 works fine is chief sketches procreate
Windows it does not work with Photoshop when I install the drivers on my windows
I just want to click the button to open that pad
we've just have them because there are a lot of issues
I have to test to see if I can replicate them
if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below
there and type c port for charging along the bottom here
june was the latest security update so in terms of that
my son played some games on it as well battery life
we have speakers here at the bottom and they do go really loud
lay it flat and have it full blast or near a full blast
then it's more manageable on the ear my ears anyway obviously
five megapixel on the rear and two megapixel on the front
don't buy this tablet for a camera because it's it's not good
eight cores four gigs of ram plenty of storage as well
i just think it is a great tablet for how much you're paying
so if you're looking for a tablet and you've got 100 quid
the fact that it's got 4g capabilities as well if you've got a sim card
Hello everyone, welcome back to the Keep Productive YouTube channel on today's feature
All you need to know but I will be doing a longer review.
frame itself and the way that they promote it on their website is it's this
So let's first start by talking about the design now first off.
It's it gets a little bit scuffed and I've been fairly careful with it
But I'll just for example be tire writing or making sketches or something like that
Although this one isn't there's two types of pen. There's like a Classic one.
They have these nib things on top and you can change them
You can do one of two things you can either Connect it.
So for example, you create a note you don't necessarily have to have it blank.
But something to note on the highlighter side is obviously this is an Ian display
I believe it's a thin thick and Thick thin medium and thick
and also when you're using the highlighter, you can change the shade you
You can also do handwritten text and then convert it into text
But I would say you have to be a very good writer
Now the one feature I've liked is the send by email feature
Being able to send it in a PNG or PDF, which is very helpful
so can actually sort of plan out stuff a bit more strategically
So you do get to access menu where you can see all of your notebooks
So on the settings side of stuff you can do a range of things.
I wouldn't think I look at but at the same time
7 to 8 out of 10 and the main reason is
its style use of it because you're using a little less paper across a day
But it doesn't necessarily replace a journaling or anything like that.
I know that from seeing some of the videos they do and all that
you will get sons more value honestly if you when you look at the price
This tablet is designed to get you away from that environment
Me too much then say a phone with note of notifications and The other question
And again, I would probably give this about a 7 out of 10
I would say the iPad with the Apple pen from using it
But you can get refurbished models on the site for like fifty dollars less
or even going up a model so you may actually be spending a bit more
now, let's talk about the markers that you get with that
But I believe there sometimes you starter packets which include it for free
But if you wanted a signature on its own, I believe that's 99 bucks.
It's a really nice build quality and I really like the click
But I really like the pen then it comes with as I said the tips
Which is either a leather design or this sort of canvas II design
so you can definitely see why this is more of a premium Experience.
You know because I've actually found a huge amount of value from
I think and it's allowed me a bit more creative freedom
I'm gonna look at the rocket book and put it against this
are there updates in that one looked a lot more attractive with the design?
Please do share your description your experience in the description below or the comments below
hello and welcome to circle pupils first review video kind of refreshing right full disclosure
I was contacted by Hume and they asked me if I wanted to do
a review of this tablet and as we wanted to expand the kind of content
we do here at circle people for quite a while now
I thought this would be an amazing opportunity to start before we get started
I also want to say that this is not a paid review
people stuff it does not get any monetary gain from doing this review
the higher the polling rate the less delay there will be from you
you can choose if you want that a little heavier or a little lighter
where you grip and you can change to do whatever you want
part of the video and the other button is on top of the pen
and it's the power button and it's in the shape of an eraser which
all of these buttons have a really satisfying click to them
it doesn't take up a lot of space on your desk
now let's take a look at the drivers for this tablet
it does to work but not efficiently or in any good manner
so my friends from gaomon sent over another tablet for us to try now
i guess right plus i have my friend with me so i wasn't so lonely
alright so i got my footage time to animate over it
the pd 2200 is equipped with a full laminated 92 ntsc 21.5 inch hd display
the pen also doesn't need to be charged so no batteries
there are also eight touch keys on the side of the monitor
he's a panda and panda is eat bamboo bambootie so yeah
make sure you check out the links in the description if you're trying to cop
my favorite tablets are 8-inch tablets and I reviewed pretty much
every 8-inch tablet that was released in the last couple of years
it is very well a bit but it does look a bit
Android tablet right now that I can really comfortably recommend the next best one
I'm only putting this on this list to make this list complete
inch IPS HD screen Full HD screen and an external 7904 processor
I can super comfortably recommend I really love it is the Samsung Galaxy Tab
I can't promise anything of course because I am NOT Samsung
sadly chances are pretty high that you won't be able to get it easily
HD resolution of 1920 by 1200 and it's a pretty nice HD Full HD screen
at m5 light 8 is a great alternative to both these
it's a nice mid-range tablet the next standard on this list is the
it's a lower end to mid-range tablet but it's a pretty nice
it is noticeably weaker than the S Pen version or than the 8.4
the battery life was pretty good with 13.5 hours in my standard test
I mentioned here because of that but it is worth it
it's a bit of work and I wouldn't recommend your grandmother doing it alone
if this has been the best 8 inch tablets you can buy right now
has like a cute little design on it and so right on the back
I don't really understand like the pen writing angle of 60 degrees
I don't know how that helps but it sounds good to me
I'm pretty sure the idea is like to replace your nib
there's the wire which obviously every tablet needs unless it's wireless
I love a little package for this just like I love this little tight
let's see if this even fits my hand though looks pretty big
it's a little big but um it doesn't really matter to me because
that's like a neat little package to keep it nice and protected
I can get it off so yeah I like this pen
the design at the tablet is pretty cool though the back being covered of cloth
I also really loved how the surface of the tablet felt
it's super satisfying to just rub my hands against it a little weird
is that damn good so while it does take some getting used to
I also wanted to talk about the size of the tablet
I found that my lines were naturally smoother in a lot of cases as well
I have a lot more breathing room when compared to my last tablets
stand a cloth specifically for cleaning the tablet a drawing glove and a USB cord
it really feels like the artists were taken into deep consideration with this product which
I can also really appreciate and finally the price is amazing
it's only $70 and it's a really really really good deal
it's a big tablet performs exceptionally and will last a long time
I think I should go over the cons that I discovered
don't take away from the quality of the product at all in fact
I think that this tablet is absolutely amazing the pressure sensitivity is stellar
because we've never really seen anything like this before the vast majority of people
I've seen talk about this and talk about how crap is she
Jay feather at all without even looking at her point of view
how would you feel knowing that it was your own advice
you would never be able to escape the guilt but wait
Rhianna Singh your own advice got your brother killed to be horribly traumatic
the idea that it wasn't her that got her own brother killed
she says how the medicine cats all seem to be acting strange
Don Pelt is noted to have been acting weird ever since poem tales death
Todd's feelings but makes it clear to them that she's mainly just hurt
Jay feather of being a murder at the gathering causing a huge fight
she wants an excuse to be angry with others instead for what happened
well it's not good to blame others and go to such lengths
I really hope I've convinced some of you to feel the same
I'd like to talk about the tablet again for a few brief moments
I think that Pablo is an amazing tablet especially at the price
and you can tell about a lot of care was put into it which
I can really appreciate if you guys are interested in purchasing this tablet which
I'm Kevin the tech ninja this is the Nokia in one tablet review
Nokia brought a premium build to the n1 tablet starting with the materials
one-piece design with surface analyzation which provides a solid premium feeling device in the hand
the tablet layout is pretty familiar volume rocker on the right side
there's no traces of any type of rattling or loose parts
nokia chose to go with a natural color profile which is easier on the eyes
the text is decently sharp on the panel but not the sharpest
PPI is fine just zooming in on text is not as crisp as other devices
I was not really familiar with this chip starting off after digging into it
we also have 32 gigabytes of on-board storage and 2 gigabytes of ddr3 800 megahertz
Ram it weighs just 318 grams as well to keep everything juiced up
inside we have a 5300 milliamp battery as mentioned earlier this is using the new
USBC connector and it's honestly a joy to use the USBC cord is reversible
the tablet provides a smooth and consistent experience throughout all the menus and applications
a great example is when playing plants vs. zombies on some devices
where there's a lot of action on the screen pretty much the whole time
and it has a custom launcher on top called the launcher
there are a few times where it does not register your finger inputs and what
best is just keep riding until it eventually shows up now
great for a tablet now beyond this launcher which is very simple
when you're playing it on your tablet and also z launcher settings
none of these are anything that would change the game of Android
a lot of images come out yellowish and has a lot of grain
even in well-lit areas now as far as camera software it is using stock software
it's a big disappointment that this camera isn't that great everything else
offer my recommendation of this tablet as always guys my name is
while you're down there go ahead and leave a comment as always guys
hi everyone mahmoud is here today i will review another graphics tablet
this is a brand new 2021 model xp pen deco mini 7w graphics tablet
it is wireless and a little bit bigger than small size tablets
dollars and mini 7 non-wireless version is about 50 us dollars on amazon
there is a usb c port for charging and the on off button
we have a lot of extra nibs and a nip remover here
these are android mod adapters one micro usb and one usbc and manuals
but i am going to download the driver and show you how it looks like
it has settings about working area monitors express keys and pen side buttons
i am going to connect this usb receiver and start checking
the tablet surface is smooth and the pen is really comfortable
so you don't need to worry about the cables around you
there is no panholder in the package and usually small size graphics
tablets do not come with pen holders they can make their own pen
he's one of my viewers so he sent me his setup
and i'm gonna show you guys you can also create a pen holder
don't forget to leave a comment below and let me know
let me show you the magnetic cover as you can see
great material and then it's very well made and it's very writing
so this is a wireless detachable keyboard it will on blue to itself
it do have if you charge it it will show you
this is very similar to any keyboard which is really nice
yeah so which is quite a nice little cover here right now
I'm gonna take this up and then I'm gonna show you the tablet itself
okay this is a 10 inch multi-touch screen tablets using an Android 8.1
you can have your calculator as a shortcut over here and that's to unlock
and then this one is all the general apps in there
I have the YouTube this YouTube at 4-4 for my son
if you've got a wireless printer excellent it just print it it will
because my son didn't have a drop off and I have it so I can
you can watch movie you can listen to radio do all sort of things
so this is where your as management so you can go to your
okay when you're done it let's get out and then we have thumb control
they can start and you know this is what you do to do it
sometimes they're quite sensitive or something they are not just depend on where
they were sort of filter and stop the kids from assessing it
it's depend on what what sort of a system you're using it so
this set it up so you have this instead of like
there's so many adjustment that you can make as your kids grow it's brilliant
hey everyone mukul here with another huion product review because wacom doesn't know me yet.
art doesn't mean that it's asking you to play games on it.
which is very light and kind of looks different to my huion
huion clearly thought to be nostalgic with its appearance this time.
so that you don't need to wipe the screen with the cleaning cloth.
two ports somehow failed to give enough power to the tablet.
but who in the whole wide world doesn't like free stuff or cables or adapters
and it also has these anti-slip rubber feet on the bottom.
okay now back to the elephant in the room pun might have been intended.
so lighter than your laptop and 11.8 mm thick in comparison
so it's not a light or super slim display tablet for sure.
but that didn't affect anything i had to do with the tablet.
uh it then also showed me this button to activate it as admin
make sure you select this screen as the active screen in the driver software.
as i tested the tablet with photoshop the experience was surreal.
the feel of the nib to the screen and its feedback was smooth and fluid
oh and you can also work on your androids with this tablet
they have posted a list of compatible devices on their website
it's a usb c 3.1 gen1 with dp 1.2 as mentioned earlier.
and i have no idea why have i just repeated it.
now the only thing left for these tablet is to go wi-fi.
now let me come on to the few drawbacks of this tablet.
if you sit upright which is the healthiest way to sit
for long hours you would find some variations in the screen colors.
so a stand would be a must to use this tablet with.
the benefits of these tablets are its price and the hardware upgrade convenience.
but at 21000 rupees or 250 us dollars or 230 pounds
in summary the overall feel of working with this tablet is top notch.
Android 9.0 has two gigabytes of RAM 32 gigs of storage 5 megapixel camera
on the back as well as a camera on the front up there
GPS Wi-Fi only and it comes in the color of black
USB cable which it was USB C charging but it is micro USB
that's actually pretty cool that they give that to you as well
Pat s7 tablet has a 7-inch display the resolution on it is 1024 by 600
you also have your button that turns the power off on the left hand side
here this is where you gonna have a lot of the button
so you'll have a button that allows you to plug in a headphone headphone
I'm gonna turn the volume down but one thing about the speakers
I did but anyways you saw it played perfectly fine next up
it's obviously gonna be able to do that so being open up
YouTube and go to my favorite youtuber in the whole world
Greg loves to be and let me play one of these videos
how about this pearl and I'm doing this stuff in real time
if your can into consuming media you should have no problems with this camera wise
I mean I'm not a huge camera person with with tablets
it's all the way up to five on the back and on the front camera
I have it down here so I have a recent apps button
I have my open this up my back button and then I also have
it'll bring down my notifications and let me see my notifications
it's it's for what you're getting you know in a competitive
life is pretty good and you know it gives you like
we're talking about a pen display tablet and a computer all in one
it's a computer and a graphic tablet fused into just one device
i've been using this for the last three weeks or so pretty much daily
and then the rest of the review will be split in two parts
the first one will be looking at the actual computer inside this thing
this was a an extra box that was included with a mouse
and a keyboard both wireless so very nice and nice addition nice touch
wow so here we have this stand um to hold this computer tablet
so i'm a big fan of that very similar to actually
and it's not meant to move around because it's it's pretty damn heavy
i will say though that you really should update your drivers as soon as you
and then in my case i have the model that has 16 gigs of ram
instead of eight those are the two options that you can get and of course
i think there's one more thing that i should point out and it is
because that's probably what most of you want to hear about as the name implies
the pixels would have been fine if it was 16 inches but at 22
i don't know but the distance feels negligible and so very little parallax
you can also see on the side of the tablet here
at least so i had a bunch of layers and then this is a file
keep things at around a million active polygons and you should be pretty happy
the model that i have here has around seven million total
but when you're logged in as a single user the drivers do behave
maybe like a better tablet something that is 4k in the future
or what if you want to upgrade your computer to something
you don't need a big computer box next to it only one cable
should you buy this and really who is this for so initially
my thought was that this was something that would be great for
you know for people that maybe uh are younger and have no computer
yeah you know that might be a really really nice upgrade
i was thinking this might also be good for people that know nothing about computers
which is why we come to the conclusion that this device here
studio 22 is for you so final words on this device here
it's a small tablet with a drawing area of 6 by 4 inches
and it's about the size of my hand so it's a pretty small
it has a matte texture feeling but overall it's considered quite smooth
is the warranty in for a quick start guide six replacement nibs and knit remover
I have already installed the driver and this is on Mac OS for some reason
so this is the mapping by default this will be mapped to the food display
open a web page or sign the button to a mouse click
I recommend a graphic tablet that is Liz 10 by 6 inches
you're gonna have to rely on your keyboard for most of the keyboard shortcuts
you can draw very lightly to get those really thin lines
this is clip studio paint and as you can see pressure sensitivity
Pro on the Mac if you happen to be using this tablet on the Mac
I have reviewed those tablets before as well links are in the video description below
it is just like you're writing on a tablet or also on paper
apparently there is a wha is a Japanese kind of circle of life thing calm
it comes with digital painting photo editing or comics and manga so
and let's open it up and it is pistachio flavor yum yum yum yum yum
so we've got kind of two buttons and we have got
so this is our introduction thing it tells you what you've got
so let's go and plug this in and see how it works now
I've just plugged in the interest and this into our setup
it's letting you know you press the button on the pen
I've registered the welcome into a small BT pen pistachio view the software library
I have to press quite hard to get to the end
and that's sort of somewhere in the middle of course the tip double-click distance
these are the little keys on the pan so the background
if you click is a right click and at the moment
so if you draw a circle you will get a circle on the screen
you can set the pen up so that the different click
YouTube there's going to be loads and loads of things on there too now
I like to draw on paper mostly and but I do coloring on Photoshop
there we go so this is a pencil and we can choose up here
you are gonna have so much fun learning what this is all about
I have no idea there is so much here for you to learn
so that obviously means that you can do animations on here as well
this looks like an amazing program to get you started and with the
I certainly can if you are a hobby digital painter or hobby somebody
I'll tell you one thing I don't actually use among us at all
I since I swapped over to using a Wacom pen no problem at all
applications and the Windows Start screen support for all sorts of touchscreen applications
maybe you can get a little bit more than I have
it's got a nice build quality on the tablet the keyboard section
windows button power and volume keys front-facing stereo speakers a front facing webcam
I believe there are some models that have a 500 gigabyte hard drive in here
we can do some typing so type in works just fine
they're not the best sounding that I've heard but they'll do in opinions
10 which has continuum for switching back and forth between tablet and desktop modes
it goes away but it can be a little bit disconcerting
Windows 8.1 I think there's a better job of balancing desktop and tablet modes then
did it can still get a little awkward from time to time so anyways
I'm not sure how often you're likely to do that anyway
let's dive in and see what it's like to draw with
I'll put a link it down in the description for that
that's the space on the display that you can draw on
small and it feels cramped too big and the porridge is gonna burn your tongue
my point is is this is the size that I like to draw
but you're probably not buying this to take pictures of it
what are these numbers yelled grandpa bear as he guzzled his porridge
I went in and I set them to a whole bunch of different shortcuts
okay you just tap them to switch between tools it's fine
they haven't even though they butt up right against the live area of the tablet
it has some tooth there so it gives it a very natural drawing feel
it's going to be more than adequate so using this on
this is exactly what I expected but what about Android this is the new feature
you can't go in and change your shortcut keys but out of the box
this tablet in sketchbook is legit pressure is working and it's working
well your lines look good in fact they might look better than they do on
Windows when I plugged it into my Android tablet which is a Samsung Galaxy Tab
would it work on a Chromebook Chromebooks can run Android apps
Chromebooks to work with and do papers on and and surf the Internet
what kind of drawing hardware can I get for this Chromebook
sketchbook is pretty decent and I get some good lines here
there is no pressure sensitivity here if you need pressure sensitivity
and considering that you're getting a such a huge tablet for just 900 rupees
it's got a nice weight to it and it feels kind of natural
i think it's quite natural to know like right over this
you are going to get your sensitivity as you can see with less pressure
or if you're an artist you can just practice some nice line work
is that in most of the tablets or things like that
there is no thing like the line is catching up to the stylus right
it is just you put down drag it just follows it instantaneously
there is absolutely no law no lag or anything and as i mentioned
let's say this is a network you can just uh where is that
i will be happy if the tablet lasts one or two years for me
i would say and you can also take out your ruler
I have used this tablet and it was functioning really well
I feel like I have been using it for a while
I have been using for two month and I still feel like it's brand news
there's nothing wrong with this tablet and one more thing that
it's just one thick line so the best option in the middle region
the tablet than the mouse and this has been really shift in my workflow
so thank you yuan for this tablet if you want to check out this product
hi everyone this video is going to be a review of the who
I had a lot of fun playing around with it and testing it out
all the packaging is black and has little silver icons showing
so the main items that came in the box was a tablet itself
stand a box on there the install disc and the Quick Start Guide
there's a link in the description to the to the Amazon page
it is a wireless tablet but you can use it plugged
it has to be recharged and it lasts longer than all the other
it doesn't have an eraser on it but I never really use that anyway
stand as well if you want to store it in there
it's like 4 years old and I didn't have any problems with the tablet
so it was a little bit awkward for me to switch to this
US dollars for being so large and so comfortable to work with overall
I've always wanted to try one of whom's tablets because I've only tried other
so thank you so much to who young for sending me this
if you have any questions please leave them in the comments
we have a micro USB cable for charging and a AC power adapter there
French layer here the first impressions as we are proceeding through
the top houses a microUSB port for charging and a micro
so if you pointed out the light just right you can see
let's take a quick look at the speakers and video streaming from YouTube
it's perfectly fine but it's definitely missing a little bit in terms of bass now
it's loading back the desktop site of the verge and you can see
some parts are taking a few seconds longer than maybe a flagship smartphone
Play Store you can see just loads up really quickly here
that's a little lighter and it will run it back without any problems
because you want to try out your own games and titles and customize the tablet
he goes so go front camera as well at the bottom
it has a speaker okay and to speak as you can see
and at the top we have takes a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and micro
x 1200 pixel it also has the IPS technology Bouin with a multi-touch screen
I can go to saying that we'll just show you something
we got the battery information the status the status gives you all this tax information
this the size of the sliminess of this is a eight point
if there's any technical folks now you can see the advanced features
okay and it's very smooth to use honestly overall with avocado brands mostly
they range from $800 to $3,000 and they are super expensive
talent was Rackham Cintiq 13 HD interactive pen display and so
I found one that was about 16 inches I think and it was
I'm thinking that a lot of people who aren't really professionals
and they have to use the tablet like that for their living
you can adjust the tablet to be almost horizontal to your table or vertical
and it's just it depends on however you wish to have it
some kind of knocking down her design to kind of basic
I really want to let you know about before you buy this
I realized that I did not have an HDMI port in my computer and what
I just I have room for more graphics cards one that had an HDMI port
just make sure that it has a mini display port or an HDMI port
install the tablet restart your computer and everything is good to go
the buttons everything was fine and connected perfectly to my computer
I'm gonna be taking a look at the new huion inspire a h4 30p
I have a lot of good things to say about this thing
a lot of people should be happy with this but it actually uses a micro
the net weight is a hundred and thirty five grams or for you
they've done this because you should always download the drivers on the website
ok let's get to the real meat and potatoes of this unboxing
so the tablet comes in this nice cover which gives it a more pre
I guess I don't know it's a really nice addition but upon first impressions
I noticed that the tablet was very light lighter than I was expecting
we have the pen which is going along with the theme of
Wacom pen but it's about the same with the XP pen
I really do like some people might not like it because it is so light
ok now that we have the unboxing out of the way
so the huion tablet drivers they're easy to install and from what
one point 0.171 204 so if anything changes in the future
this is mainly gonna be useful for the artists out there
I think it 116 K so I've had no problem advancing at all
it only took me about 30 minutes to adjust to this tablet
some people might not like it because it is as light as it is so
I just I kind of like this pen a bit more when playing
I really don't have many gripes with this tablet at all
this is a no su players dream now once you get to the higher levels
I don't know about more experienced players but the average player
I'd also like to thank each one of my patrons for kindly supporting the channel
just a heads up to my patrons and any future patrons
we're watching the macGruber movie but yeah thanks for watching guys
with the power of a gaming laptop of the compact design of a tablet the
Crysis 3 still looks incredible for less demanding titles like Tomb Raider
the settings can be cranked up too high without dipping below 30fps
3 Far Cry 3 XCOM and countless others with great results
for general tablet use the edge gets roughly 5 to 6 hours per charge
it has a critical impact on speed and precision in shooters and action titles
I always had to have edge and gamepad propped up on my lap
Android tablets aren't really setting the world on fire these days
inch tablets running an almost completely stock version of Android 9pi
first it's important to keep something in mind throughout this review
inch tablet most definitely does this device has a 10.1 inch IPS
they sound more like the speakers you find in greeting cards
which would essentially allow for apps to be installed onto the card
even more in my opinion same could be said for the 0.3
and really there's no reason to spend any more time here talking about the cameras
they're lightweight titanium wrap headbands that use wireless bluetooth 4.1 connectivity and multi-point pairing
Nasir and their to be expected I would say doing the verge
switching between chrome tabs takes a second or two but it does manage
it's not really the end of the world now as for games
crush is gonna be fine one of my all-time favorite mobile games
that's basically the only major change that has been made to the otherwise completely stock
10.1 inch tablet as long as you understand what you're getting
maybe you won't be disappointed but really don't expect much yes it runs vanilla

i have actually reviewed the previous model before the non-pro the m106k non-pro now
the price at the time of this review is under u.s 60 dollars all right
let's take a look at the things that i included first here
no port at the back because this pen no longer requires any battery to work
buttons on the side feedback is quite firm and when you press the button
that you can also customize you can assess them with the pen
this drawing area is 10 by 6 which is considered a medium size
okay this is where you can customize the 12 physical shortcut buttons and the 16
and this is where you can change the rotation the orientation of the tablet
if you guys have any questions let me know in comment section below
hey Teddy K here for Best Buy plugin and in this video review
of course being a two-in-one convertible means that you can separate the two
that's basically what you need and closing it up is pretty straightforward too
I want to get into battery life a little bit here
you're gonna have to pump that up a little bit now notice when
I do that so if I go to a higher number
what happens so now as the unit is made the adjustments so
I've gone to 100% and now I'm down to 4 hours right
time running certain apps on the 8 on the 11 inch
the keyboard is a big big difference between these two but I would argue that
be better on the 11 inch as well but here there you have it
I just want to give a big shout-out to van Keogh
it's just an image of the tablet and then on the back of the box
so that's nice that they've included it and we can go ahead and peel
we actually have plastic encasing there and I'm assuming the reason that they've done
we've got a 13 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front camera
but it does have expandable memory up to 128 gigabytes with a micro
so you'll have more than sufficient potential for memory if you need it
in terms of what's on the back of the tablet we just have our van
I've heard some people say that you can't download netflix or things like that now
so that's really cool too in terms of performance regular web browsing
we want to see how well this thing can perform with basic emulation
I just don't like - that being said I was really impressed with the performance
I just really have a thing for this Rayman game not sure what it is
we don't have any graphical errors and there's definitely no slowdown or lag
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at another game in this case
it just ran really well so that's a really good thing to and then finally
Dreamcast running on this thing so the app I used for
Dreamcast emulator and this is what I found to be the absolute best
it ran really really well very smoothly and it didn't have any hiccups
but it really wasn't that big of a deal and then finally
I did test out Kingdom Hearts and it was hit or miss
I really appreciate it and thank you guys for watching the video
I'm going to go ahead and boot it up for the first time now
tablets aren't gonna win any awards but they will get you by
this is an 8 inch 1280 by 800 IPS display and for the price
AC Wi-Fi so we can pick up at that 5 gigahertz network bluetooth
10 HD total score on that 126,000 632 and our GPU was around 30000
and then we'll move right into some emulation with the new fire eight
I'm getting an average of around 30 FPS with 8 chunks
we can do that from the menu and now we got a constant 60 unfortunately
and that's really the only game that gave me issues out of the 10 games
and they go on sale all the time for around 99 bucks so personally
but in my opinion it's totally worth it especially with that extra gig of ram
you guys can get higher data storage if you need to
so sometimes they have sales so definitely look around the holidays
we can go ahead and watch different tv shows on here
you know you got all this stuff disney showtime star sling
just all this stuff games books just so much you guys can do
how awesome it is definitely check out the link in my video description
i've seen it at one hundred dollars honestly at all those price points
um but if you guys are really strong penny pinchers then wait for around holidays
Kobo tablet obviously saw that I mentioned their products in one of their videos
and they've actually sent me one here to have a look at so
you find a nice little letter with discount for next time
you shop on their store which is nice as well as some instructions
obviously when you buy it it has all those on there
I've just pulled some out for the demo phrase that I've done here
some of these letters had actually already moved around in transit
Kobo tablet does not come with numbers or symbols so this Kobo tablet
we'd basically just pop out the letters we need and stick them in there
just based off the first four letters all right so once
I'm doing this this and that but just for the purposes of this demo
you can still buy two of these for the price of one of these
just to help make sure that a single event isn't gonna wipe out your crypto
hit like if you think that other people would find this video useful and hit
subscribe if you'd like to be kept in the loop about future content
stay safe in the crypto space and to recover if they get into trouble
so here we have the brand-new tablet right out of the post
put that to the side and we'll be using that later at the CD
can't just take it out the little slip here and first things first
they did remark on how actually quite small it is and yeah
I would say half the size of the Wacom arch so just first impressions
we have a little instruction guide that go through all the basics
oh it looks like over here that the holder actually has ten dips in it
so we're going to take the tablet for a bit of a test run now
I'm gonna install it now and I'll be back with the settings
it's always the thing that's recommended whenever you're it installing and you tell it but
I think that I always forget or I just don't really want to like
I can't be bothered and you know I figure it's fine
it worked fine but then it never does and it's because
I never removed her old drivers so once I did that
you know it's a science experiment now for the rest of this video
I'll kind of jump in and out of time lapse at the beginning
that being said using this tiny tablet with a giant screen
I could definitely feel a loss of accuracy in my brushstrokes
coloring in the base of the character within their lines was actually a little difficult
exactly where the brushstroke was going to go and I could imagine that
if you're listening to just review agree a degree of customizations for things like pen
I would say the calibration definitely caters to people with lighter grips
which for some reason my mouse just didn't want to do so
holder is also pretty cool and actually really really enjoyed using the pen
it will be perfect because this tablet hardly takes up any desk space
I will recommend saving up bit more money to buy something a little bigger
if you're interested again this is the huion h6 for 0
there's an 8 megapixel rear camera and a 2 megapixel front-facing camera and another thing
it's got an Intel Atom 3 7 7 0 quad-core processor
when you use the two together officially it gives you about 50 percent battery boost
you know it's not that much slower when it comes to doing
my internet connection is being a little bit on the sluggish side here so
I guess we don't have pinch-to-zoom in Firefox here an ad for a competing site
I kid I'm a fan of Android Central there we go so we've got full
when you're running certain apps like image open source image editing software which is loading
you know it looks good there we can go ahead and zoom into 200%
it's matte and even has a polarizer so yeah that's pretty interesting stuff
of course you might want a keyboard so enter this incredibly rugged
that's why we're still an eighth trend because we don't have
gigs of ddr3 low-power RAM and it has an m2 nvme
so that's a bit more modern than you might have guessed from
though you know honestly the jump between 8th and 10th gen
this is not for photoshop jockeys obviously this is a very specialized counter product
but when you look at it it actually doesn't look that way
I think it's a function of the display being driven as such high brightness
it is a tablet after all and also a pen now
you can just put one and if you want you can put both in
I have to say that this thing has been going for like 14 hours straight
Rhian has sent me another tablet to check out so today
they make a lot of tablets of different sizes different features now today
it measures around 11 inches wide and 7 inches in height
this is the on/off switch and on the other side there
switch which will lock your physical shortcut button if you want to
it's right here so you can just put dollars like this
and there's no way for me to actually drag on the curve itself now
sensitivity personally are not able to differentiate between 4,000 and 8,000 levels of pressure
there's no left hand or right handed mode you have to rotate the tablet here
the tablet cannot be used when you are charging the battery
it's still able to detect the stylus but the stylus cannot move
you can only know that if you compare them side-by-side but here
well enough for me let me show you the transition between thin and thick
it's a brush now in order to get the pressure sensitivity to work
there is no lack so this is great and right now
it has a lot of tools and brushes that's dedicated to calming
there's a sharp drop in the thickness but for some other strokes
I guess we're doing cross hatching or hatching lines like this
let me jump over to try a few sketches pro now font
the tablet it doesn't work because the driver hasn't loaded yet
so if you are having this problem maybe this is the solution
so that's all thanks for watching you in the next video bye you
here and welcome back to another product review in this video
I believe what is this one at least is there a 30 or so
but we're gonna go over to some footage of me unboxing this thing so
I can talk to you about some specs and stuff like that
mind my skills with this thing like in the last bike video and any video
I'm gonna do my best to try and show you what this thing can do
they did form fit this thing pretty well but I do like that
I have a little ninety degree on there so good job Mike next
so there's no battery that is required and it's in a nice little case
it's kind of like a nice little like felt or something
I start getting stuff out now with that battle the way
so that's this little pad thing allows you to zoom so
I can easily just kind of do that to zoom which is nice
Oh God okay but I am trying to be fair here
that eyes all kinds of what got a nice feel to it definitely
the material has a little bit of like actual give give to it or not
looks like there's like a very small very subtle wiggle and
I think it'll be great for anyone who's really trying to start out
I would have is these these buttons need actual like they're not actual buttons
they're a little like plus marks but they're really hard to see
I'm gonna be doing more art streams soon so check me out
this is going to be a review video because the company called
can it actually do the job that I need it to do
I don't care to have the latest iPhone with a tripled camera or depth thing
I used to have an iPhone 5 until Apple upgraded it until it was not
that's you know that's that you're supposed to have in our review
Rosie making sure that the editing is on point here what do you think Rosie
then you might want to have the standard one but I wanted this one
the thing is start with pen and paper if you want to start sketching stuff
I don't like the new tablets because they have a different surface to them
this is very easy to sketch on and depend flows very easily the new ones
we have all the cables you have the VGA cable you have the HDMI cable
you also have some instruction on how to install this tablet and
I also really like this little detail here that huion put on the screen
it still works great and now it's just a little bit more original personally
you get the brush menu and then you can quickly select what brush you want
I know how satisfying it can be to watch so here
you can watch two of my videos at the same time let me show you
tablets is the distance between the sketch surface and the nib and the line itself
I know it can be annoying for some people in the beginning
I started sketching as soon as I got the HDMI to Thunderbolt adapter
I like to see the whole canvas when I'm sketching meaning
I'm so used to a regular tablet that I never felt the need to switch
I haven't had that issue with the who beyond even after long
I'm using even if it has a bunch of buttons on the side
all of the sketching the size of the tablet for me is just about right
I prefer this size over the larger tablets out there and not that I care
can we use the hooey on canvas 22 sketch and redesign a cars in Photoshop
hello guys and welcome back to the channel in this video
also you can now format the sd card as an internal storage
it's faster smoother and more app so compatible than the stock android 7 rom
you can also change the clock style grid layout and of course the wallpaper
the touch sensor is a little buggy sometimes it takes like three seconds to unlock
i kept getting a network error even though i have internet connection
click the like button and comment the hidden word found in this video at number
and on the meantime offer a great tablet experience the more
I started liking it after using it for a couple of weeks
it's the Lenovo tab for another great tablet is the Lenovo tab 4
the lenovo tab 4 comes with a 10.1 inch screen it also has a 2.0
s8 is another amazing tablet with its beautiful and simple design
this one is definitely one of the most valuable tablets in the market
you want you can also add up to 128 gigabytes with a micro
I didn't notice any lags as I was playing some games and changing between apps
i used the zed stylus and did some sketching and design work
I had fun to be honest and then I started to open up tabs
I think that this tablet is worth it at number two
the thing is that they didn't stop there and delivered us
m5 is a tablet which everybody should check out and see how good it is
Hardware it doesn't support Netflix or 1080 the display like I said is amazing
make me spend even more time using the media pad m5 it
millimeter jack and it feels a bit weird when you use it vertically
otherwise it's a great tablet that will help you a lot in your everyday life
I would highly recommend this tablet to the people who want an amazing display
Samsung is one of the best to ever produce this Cayenne device
this tablet feels and looks a lot like the tablets that are very expensive
I played some games and I can't say that I had a great time
four five out of five stars no doubt it's very affordable and provides great quality
but it's as tablet good enough for simpler tasks and enjoyed for my next ablator
eight millimeters and lighter with 250 4 grams so than the Amazon fire 7
on the right side we get a power button and volume controls
it's a 7 inch screen with a resolution of 1024 by 1600
the screen is noticeably better than the one from the fire
I've got the 80 version and as you can see in my benchmark
I suggest you get 60 gigabyte as well out of the box
the performance is pretty bad and it does not get better in my gaming test
I had to wait quite often doing my review of this tablet
let's get to something more positive and that is a software really
I don't think that there will ever be a major software update
UI is almost not customized at all and that is great
I recommend really know what have 7 essential sadly for most
I also like that we almost get vanilla Android and the battery
so what's really important about this is you might be wondering okay
the crypto steel and the crypto tag which are very nice and very premium products
they price anywhere between $80 and 250 dollars this device here is only $39
I'm gonna do a quick unboxing here to kind of show you how that works
Model T for instance only comes with the twelve twelve word recovery C phrase
so that people can't go in and steal and look your recovery C phrase
I recommend this really for anyone that has over forty dollars
in the bill fall they were not as as sleek and clean as this one
they have different sizes so it was kind of like thrown together
that were lost and what had happened is is he had his recovery
the battery died so the only way that he could recover
I have actually a few of these in fact I have a Kobo vault
I'll go ahead and leave a link in the description below
it wasn't everything we'd hoped it would be so take two is something
we're look at it now so this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
you don't have to hunt the keyboard and you get the full sides
so you can clip it to the side of the tablet for transit
not as long as your usual laptop kind of charger but you get the idea
you know lenovo often lets us down a little bit with the quality of their
but that's a little abusive to be twisting something like that
lenovo says that the back can be removed to upgrade the internals
I'm sure Ranma soldered on as always at the SSD which is a SATA 3
the kickstand is released with the lever over here and it's resistant space
let's put it that way and you can go down this far
ThinkPad keyboard just twelve inches in size a little smaller than normal
I adjusted to it pretty quickly and I found it very pleasant to type
and that's how it connects to the bottom of the tablet
maybe yes just like surface so you take it we do that
you got your volume controls your headphone jack and the power button
it's mostly all good news here and Lenovo often falls behind the competition
when it comes to color gamut they usually do pretty good on brightness
that part is good but this is a very very reflective display
not a problem if you're going to be using this for Photoshop
that's a 1.1 gigahertz core M turbo boost higher than this
so don't worry it doesn't spend its whole life running that slowly
computationally that means any computational tasks it's heavy like crunching big spreadsheets in
it's going to take a bit longer but again it's it's been fluid
so keep that in mind but it's not going to be some
my hands are not on the screen in part because well
it's not getting in my way at all so there you have it and lastly
that's up to the hardware and not the software so that works quite well
where sometimes it can just totally fall far enough behind that
it's not quite as fast as I would like it's bearable
it's okay for a business work for note-taking it's just fine
playbook this is BlackBerry's answer to all the other tablets out there
it comes in seven-inch with an s 7 inch LCD screen with three different variants
you may have seen the video if you have it in the description box
it does have two cameras front facing and a rear facing camera
you've got the speaker and the speaker itself is actually a very high quality speaker
you don't have to use it a full blast like other
the problem with other tablets are the speakers they have is
they're actually on the sides or behind on the rear of tablet
out there that are seven inches or smaller actually have mobile phone software
you will note that the PlayBook does support flash which is a huge teeth
well incorporate it in the browser one thing to note with the OS
there's no native email or client or contact applications which is a little bit frustrating
at this stage the 16 gigabyte version retails for 580 not eighty dollars
there a little bit cheaper and you push them from all large electronic
i'll be happy with that and it does give you a little bit more
Portability and in taken around a little bit easier than the ipad 2
sup guys cerebro here with t3g bringing you another review this time
I wanted to know the 10 inch I wanted an Android
sorry so found this bad 190 bucks one gig of ram
never never too happy about that but I took a look at the display
I'm not doing fancy stuff with 10 fingers and I you do stuff
and yeah so the next thing is will we toss them actually the one thing
so we've got a large section here under the tablet pop that up
it's actually nice and padded so during shipping and transport to your home
I'll say why let's touch the hardware first on the back
we've got that back the rear facing camera we have our speakers
there had actually gotten like this person back happen that your mini HDMI port
it's a lower-end tablet but I still wanted to see how it works
my standard four point one launcher was still on the system which
I mean it runs pretty decently honestly for again an off-brand tablet your four point
Pro or prestige 10 d or G or an or Saturn something
I think it's prestige tending it does have Google Play according to the website
I'm actually gonna show this on there anymore so with Google Play
the let's just say Twitter so Twitter comm play and 50% done so welcome Twitter
I did find basically all the comic reading apps that I used on Android before
I don't know I don't know what did what to call it
find for the 90 bucks absolutely pick it up cuz why not me
got a couple fun videos coming up for you guys stay tuned you
Matthew Bonas here and right in front of you have Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
I never recommend a hybrid laptop that uses the case as a hinge
I find those designs to be very poor and offer a very janky experience
I just want to talk about the pen for one second
I didn't have any latency and writing and drawing on it was great
so exactly like the surface pro that means when it comes to productivity
you're gonna get a lot more mileage out of this display
now the other difference is the fact that you have a webcam in the back
I can't say the same thing about the front-facing 2-megapixel camera
you're using this thing to videoconference with your taking this into meetings
Windows hello recognition through the fingerprint but the fingerprint scanner is on the tablet itself
the keyboard on the x1 tablet is great for a hybrid laptop personally
so that means you get two more cores compared to last year
which makes it great for things that can utilize it so
League of Legends or even overwatch on very low settings in terms of heat
I'd be kind of concerned but overall this laptop handles heat very well
the fans kept nice and quiet now when it comes to a battery life
let me know your thoughts on the x1 tablet in the comments below
if you enjoyed this video feel free to hit the like button
if you're new to the channel subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
all of the opinions you're about to hear are my own
this is 149 dollars for the 32 gigabyte version for that price
though you're going to be getting ads on the lockscreen like this so
the overall look and feel of this is exactly the same as the prior Edition
picks up a lot of fingerprints but it looks really nice for a budget device
this is running at 1900 by 1200 which is the same that the prior
but it's still not great so this one's now 2 megapixel
I think before it was just like the VGA resolution 640 P or something 480p
excuse me the rear camera is also a 2 megapixel shooter again
we're just going to browse the nasa.gov homepage here and you can see
I've been overall just pleased with just how snappy and responsive everything is is
Play that app will have to be repurchased on this now
let's check that out now if you prefer this to be an Amazon echo
they will be quite happy with what they're going to get out of this
and this is one of the more challenging emulators on the Android platform
but it does its core tasks quite well and the performance boost here is noticeable
welcome to the review of the houyan inspire roy h 1060 p in this video
don't worry it all go back to focusing on my thing soon okay okay
it's got a rubber grip so you hold onto it quite nicely
it's in a bag so I guess we'll get to that last
it doesn't look like it actually did come with a glove which
I guess that's just instructions for how to though I Drive a manual ears
but here's the drawing tablet in a bag guys so here it is
I think this bit here is for the pin to like so like
hold your pen I guess or you can I call it by there
that code but there is 16 of those so it looks very cool
it feels really good so yeah it looks cool feels good
I would say I'd say it's a meter cable long enough
I think I just need to download the drivers as definitely unless they like
anything like that then that would get broken but apart from that
so you guys if you're either ever getting a package from
I can't fullscreen it so you guys can only see a tiny portion of it
and so you've got a total of 13 hotkeys that you can have
I finished my drawings and everything so my overall thoughts of it is
it's really nice and comfortable to use for long periods of time
it's really comfortable so I definitely recommend it to you guys
it is one of the most powerful kids tablets out right now today
it comes with a red rubber silicone case that can be removed without its cover
the knobby is white with non-functioning red buttons in the corners
but their main purpose is to customize the tablet with various accessories overall
one of the most important factors especially with a higher priced product
the internet was slow at first but after that the load time was extremely fast
well laid out and fun to use plenty of parental control features
here and today we are back with another review this time
we're going to be looking at the 2019 version of samsung's galaxy tab a
i played with this and i have to say it is a pretty decent product
tab a comes in three separate colors i have the black here notice
you don't get that nice amoled screen but the display is still nice on here
you got a xno 7904a processor in here and it comes pre-loaded with android 9.0
and it has samsung one ui over that as far as camera
up front takes pretty decent pictures but most of the times
now you notice you still get those nice vibrant colors on here screen
uh let's let's just do this for the fun of it as you can see
now i know a lot of people are going to say
hey i play um fortnite or i play pub g on my tablet
everything looks good when you want to get out of here
this is basically going to be the tablet for that person
we'll check out these resolutions so it starts out at 480.
we we can actually go up to 1080 at 60 frames per second
the person that's looking for something just to entertain them help them surf the web
after releasing the thinnest lightest 10 inch late last year with a tablet z now
it also adds a much more powerful processor and an improved display more or less
Sony again managed to keep a tablet waterproof and with IP 58 certification in depth
so let's dive five feet deep into Sony's nest and it's late
Starbucks says when you're holding an aluminum iPad air for instance
it's not right under your thumb tip so you can't press
those flaps fit very tightly and a soft flush with decided
if they weren't marked you'd be looking around for them for quite some time
the tablet will keep reminding you to close them if they left open or else
fir that are set to produce brighter and more evenly spread lighting
and especially annoying if you use the tablet outdoors despite the decent 414
there isn't much difference from the previous experience and Sony's two offers
which is a decent way to multitask on the tablet if needed
Sony's new catwalk model is powered by a fast 2.3 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 801
needless to say it improved processing power results in a fluid browser performance
there are no hiccups while panning around scrolling or zooming in and out
Sony uses the stock Chrome browser that comes with Android now so if you want
Adobe Flash support you'd have to look for third parties options
there are two versions of the tablet based on the connectivity options
the tablet sports this infrared sensor at the top managed by dedicated apps
editing modes that can be used from within the apps interface
the tablet shoots in a wide 16 by 9 aspect ratio
Sora's Xperia z2 tablet is a great improvement over its record-setting predecessor
it is even thinner with a much faster chipset and a better display also
there are only a few issues with the z2 tablet chief
the jet pro has a high-resolution display and a new magazine
it is less compact in the z2 tablet however and isn't waterproof
so we may not see another version of these in 2020
Wacom does not offer a display that you draw directly onto instead
and there's an option for connecting the tablet to your computer wirelessly with bluetooth
Android devices to draw on your phone using a portion of your drawing tablet surface
one by eight point four inches because it's pro it's obviously more professional
you can make the same quality art on the one by
you will need to connect it to your device with a video cable
well you can do basic digital painting and drawing making art on
five is a pair of display tablets the Wacom Cintiq 16 and the Cintiq 22
both sizes of this tablet are great but as you know
s-- require an hdmi video connection to a Mac or Windows computer
now here's where we start to transition to tablets that are more for professional use
13 is only a bit more expensive than the non pro
there are legs that fold out to provide a 20 degree angle to draw on
the sixteen inch version of the mobile studio pro does support
is that the mobile studio pro uses mobile processors which prefer power saving over performance
money can buy the extra-large active drawing areas of the Cintiq pro 24 and 32
and if you do need to zoom pan or rotate the Cintiq
HD screen resolution the color gamut accuracy on the Cintiq pro
Cintiq pros with only one angle however you can buy a couple of different stands
Wacom ergo stand and then there's the Wacom branded ergo flexor guitar on arm
so it's not as elegant of a connection as the single
if you'd like to watch in-depth reviews of these drawing tablets
today we have a review of a Chinese tablet via the company X Gobi
it's a 9 inch or winner a 33 quad core processor brick
TF card slot and DC charging port and micro USB charging slot
either it's smudgy and will scratch with a breath or two on it
the cameras are totally awful with the front-facing camera being a zero point
I bought this to listen to the radio online in the kitchen
so technically that works the software continuously runs by apps and pop-ups with no intervention
please do that to the daughter mostly to show you anything please
Ecco series you could check out last year's series up here
Amazon does show ads on the home screen when you wake the device
you do not have to baby this thing now leads me to the build quality
there are ways around that that I will explore in a future video
all these tabs are designed to jump right to amazon's various offerings
listen to an audible book or continue a show using these tabs a great benefit
Amazon does have an app store where you can find many popular apps and games
I went through my iPad to see what I could find in
you can find various music and video streaming apps a few that
Microsoft Outlook there is no Microsoft Office Chrome browser and other apps
I feel like it'd be a big step backwards to try and do those things
now this does have a web browser but it is not Safari or Chrome
and unimpressive so many things can be done today on a good web browser
this one just doesn't cut it the lack of Google services is very disappointing no
this is a tablet under $100 sometimes even under $50 now on to what
I see is using it like an echo show to enhance your echo experience
if you like to read listen to audiobooks watch videos or play games
I do not see this as a device for much beyond those uses
I need to get done to wrap this up even at full price
there's also international links that will take you to your country's Amazon homepage
Haggai so I bought the tablet recently and I wanted to check it out
Lenovo tablet called the Lenovo minx 310 and now and again
Windows 10 tablets to see you know what they bring to the table
it's not going to compete with the laptop of a high caliber
it's also fully at which screen here in terms of the responsiveness
you know touch of class here at the end of the day
so let's just go into the operating system again so we are running
we can have a look here at some things I have installed in fact
I mean you're not going to be doing much heavy here
I was a little bit concerned when I first got it
in regards to the available storage you can see after all the updates
so there's lots of expandability options here you can see is well we get
I've noticed it runs pretty slow compared to like for example a more powerful machine
Here I am using a wireless mouse as well so but it's very usable
you know in terms of you know getting a good game on
let's just turn up so you can see them a bit
I'm dead flying really annoying so you can see it plays pretty well here
it does slow down a little bit when the action heats up
I'm probably new to practice but oh I gotta kill it
Lenovo Tab m8f HD the F HD stands for full HD now
some of my regular viewers might be a little confused because recently
it's a single speaker setup it's tuned by Dolby and it does sound pretty decent
and the tablet does support up to a 2 terabyte microSD card around back
we have an 8 megapixel camera in a very sleek aluminum design
this is the best one that I've seen so far it's an 8 inch IPS
GPU that was in the HD version three gigabytes of lpddr3 ram
it is a pretty stock version of Android but they have included some blow
it's working great like most new tablets should and just like the m8
I am right now and I'm going to be streaming in 1080p
I want to see how much more powerful this chip is
Geekbench for single core for the eff HD version nine zero nine multi 39:56
it was much higher than the ma HD but again the fire 10 HD
Dead or Alive - it's just not going to cut it
I've seen it dip down to around 38 fps in some situations
pega and you'll be good to go but the performance for native
it has all the cables and other important stuff required to use the tablet
you have one wheel so it is a really nice feature
i had already removed this protective film which was on the tablet
there is another power cord this one and you get two pens with this tablet
then there is a glove with xp pen branding on it
a cloth for cleaning the surface of the tablet warranty card and a user manual
so these are the things you get along with the tablet
one end to the computer and one end to the tablet
which is full hd to turn it on simply keep your finger here
another great thing about this tablet is is its color accuracy
another one is you can change the brush size with the dial like this
I go that's Chris here from tick tablets with the remix
and it's one of the the best in a TV screens
so you have a very kind of surface to like tablet
I even actually find it a lot better than my surface 3 keyboard which
but you could see that both of these keyboards have about the same thick
which is what the focus of this tablet is basically all about being a productive
Android tablet it puts in there just like that you can fold that back
you can pop that up straight away just from a quick button
I'll move around a little but it's interfering with it typing
it does come with quite a good application here that I do like
you can you quickly just swap over so you want to go back and -
Play and I'm just running actually in the background just a couple of downloads
and there's a webcam on the rear as well that also has a microphone
and there's there's nice leather in there that all runs fine
thank you for watching a video and do subscribe to my channel
I will have more up and coming videos of other tablets from China
pro it's got this built-in kickstand that's adjustable to a number of different angles
holds everything in place nicely and works at a variety of different angles
two USB type-c ports one is USB 3 and the other is Thunderbolt 3
Microsoft Surface tablet full-size USB port and another full-size USB port
sit out a little bit from the edge but not too much another thing
the tablet has a starting price about seven hundred and ninety nine dollars
and that gets you some pretty nice basic hardware including everything that I mentioned before
that helps this device be relatively energy efficient and relatively cool
it won't necessarily do quite as well on certain benchmark tests but
this display is a 3.2 aspect ratio screen it's a 28 80 by 1920
I went ahead and installed and it loads and then crashes
I'm not sure if that's because of the processor or something else though clearly
Eve says you should be able to get around 8 hours
I found that when I'm using it for a heavy web browsing and web work
I get more like 5 or 6 hours of battery life
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and just watch local video so overall it's a pretty nice device
the keyboard sort of you know covers it and protects it the keyboard
I should also point out that this is at 200% scaling
but I think that the 200% recommended scaling works pretty well for most situations
I look at it so that is a quick look at the Eve V tablet
I'm just not entirely sure that this is the right sort of device for me
you can check out some benchmark scores and other details at little of
buting and again you can find more details at lilliputian com
I did mention in my own boxing video how I felt
this could be a cheap alternative to walk-ons interest pen tablets
the cheapest interest is the interest draw small at approximately 60 pounds in the UK
it has an active area of 6 by 3.7 inches and comes with 4
there's more space to move the drawing hand around around smooth and natural stroke
large active area is also more preferable for large screen resolutions
I could see the bright blue flashing lights in the corner of my eye once
I am so going to cover it with black insulating tape
the driver doesn't conflict with any other existing drivers on the map
it plugged in and then come back to wake my MacBook
Pro up from sleep and use the n7o 8 straight away
DS driver have installed it simply made the V's fly ever disappear
I leave a link to the Windows setup video in the description box the response
in the taskbar the cursor would have a spasm in fact
the tablet is instantly usable as soon as it's plugged in overall
hello everyone this is aldrin here and welcome back to another video
let me just smell this nice smell of plastic and i love it
no oh i see so you basically like lift this up and the laptop follows
let's just put the laptop aside and let's see what we have and over here
why okay so what we have is a very badly packed cable
okay cool this this typical british cable so very nice a bunch of papers here
congratulations on your recent lenovo pages and a bunch of you know services stuff
legend 5 15 inch or 17 inch got that setup guides the typical setup stuff
have the safety and warranty guide to this bunch of safety stuff
the box itself is quite sturdy as you can see by the way
i don't know just put this side and put the bag aside by the way
you go so we have the laptop itself now first impression is actually
uh by the way if you can see the lenovo legion logo over here
you can see that it's kind of what is this shiny polychromatic stuff
i'm not sure if it's gigabit or not but it's an ethernet jack
i believe that's power inlet and then there's a kensington lock oopsies
there is basically a huge intake all the way from the top to the bottom
it's a pretty well built piece of plastic and it doesn't feel like this
this is a good keyboard so this has really good travel
uh it sounds really nice well and um it has really tactile feeling
yeah it gave me a really good impression and overall just looks quite well built
it doesn't feel really like flimsy and all that kind of stuff
uh and let's try to open this up and see if it boosts up
aesthetically the joy 11 feels really bulky and heavy as a tablet
the tablet has its power volume and windows button placed at the rear
the specs of the jaw 11 is kind of dated in today's standards
the front and rear side of the tablet features the same 2 megapixel camera
according to my tests the keyboard dock is a little bit disappointing in some way
but i actually do not find it too bad to see screen
brightness is neither too glaring nor dark and the ips panel
the joy 11 gets very warm after a certain duration of usage
You can just speak directly to your device, and get all of your questions answered.
So, I'm skipping ahead, skip ahead another ten seconds, it's very, very, fast, very responsive.
You guys want to try it at home, it breaks, try it.
I am not going to do this against a hardwood floor
this time, but the tablet sustained the smashes, the floor did not, so...
Oh no, it's my phone that fell. It's fine. (laughs) Still working.
Let me show you what the table looks like right now.
Actual indentations, scrapes, marks, the tablecloth was not in particularly good shape.
But I bet it has a lot of ups and downs.
And, with Dolby Audio speakers, it's also a good music system if you are traveling.
That widescreen viewing is particularly good for streaming, and Netflix, and Amazon Prime.
I'm sorry, but congratulations, you just got a free Fire HD 10.
that just watch, who are like, wow, that was, that was interesting.
so you can boot it into either Google Android or indeed Windows
we've also got a headphone jack and we've got a micro
I think it's a really nice IPS display and that resolution
I think dual-boot tablet is a great option for a lot of people
I like the chamfered edges actually just to touch on this build quality
plus thank you very much for watching if you've got any questions at all
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in another video very soon
that's a 16 inch screen and yeah it looks pretty good
isn't that bad at all and you can see that in my pen test
obviously if you need to jump ahead to that or you can watch
we go looking at the back of the artists all the sixteen box
there's some interesting pieces coming straight out which I'll get to will
you have a jog wheel as well as the hot keys which is pretty cool
I'm left-handed so I want these on the right hand side
yep who use it the other way around all of those hotkeys feel pretty stable
the nib has quite a bit of movement but didn't bother me too much
I'd like a lot of other tablets to come with this to be honest inside
it's in a few different languages but also in that packet
sorry I have to take off this article of now because I I just
we've drawing experience at all and it actually doesn't make the cable really really sturdy
LPI pen resolution but I'm not so sure that this has pen tilt actually
I'm pushing down and trying to test that you know pressure curve
I'm happy with the way that this is turned out moving on
I know a lot of you guys like manga and comic books
drawing tablet is that it's actually really good for line drawing
X and learn to draw overall though it was absolutely fine
I did manage to create a nice piece of artwork in the end something
you know just for a nice little sketch and what was
I'm happy to say you can create both on this tablet for me
know my thumb using that for brush sizes and for the zoom but yes
I think some people are gonna say yes to some things and no to others
which things you want but on a day to day basis
that's pretty cool so I'm doing a few different styles here
I think they've come along amazingly well and given how much this tablet cost
comparisons as long as I give you all the information you know
this is a 15.6 screen and the pen technology as you can see
we're gonna spend just an hour or so during a sketch
but yeah they used to have action figures covered in flocking like fell
nothing good will come of it so yeah you have to draw it yourself so
it has a stand coming with it but do you know what it is
Wacom users who you know who have 20 years experience in digital art
if that's you out there then you're gonna absolutely love this
you can see the kind of work that I've been able to do
and if you go and look at my portfolio on my website
carol which is one of my favorite books out there so yes
I think this tablet is really good at that but you know I think
let me know what you think in the comments about sketches that
let me know what you think about the pen tests everything
let me know what you're using at the moment to create our
tin and you're watching the review of eyeballed slide i-70 one performance tablet now
pack this tablet is available for a price tag of just rupees 4999
pack is the travel charger along with the microUSB pin the eyeball slide
and the major issue with this tablet is the screen quality
it is not at all good but you can improve it a little bit
and now let's check out the camera and yes it is working
you can use this tablet in portrait as well as landscape mode
the screen size is so small that it is difficult tapping at the right point
that came free with this tablet going to attach the mini
the tablet screen will be mirrored on this screen as you can see
receiver it's a wireless mouse receiver and this is the mouse that I'll be using
output is coming out of the TV so I'm going to reduce the TV volume
and as you can see it is set to duplicate the display
I'm going to change the multiple display option to show only on two
that means the display will show only on my TV and as you can see
I have connected the wireless mouse as well as the USB pendrive
3 benchmark application and while installing it requires the net framework ok
I'm going to cancel that because I've got limited storage space
this is the online game and I am already connected to the Wi-Fi network
I will not be able to play this game because I have not connected
the external keyboard there is lag but the game should be playable
but you can always connect an external screen using HDMI cable after one r51
one is as good as a netbook but with limited storage space of 16gb
the screen quality is not that great however for the price tag of rupees 4999
the doodoo from fusion garages caused quite a stir here at stuff on paper
you can override this sensor to make everything just a little bit brighter
the lack of flash support and working in the cloud is brilliant
there's no way to install client software for the likes of Spotify or Skype
the speakers are horrible though so plugging in your headphones to the 3.5 millimeter
but perhaps this could all be saved by a future firmware update
we've got your volume controls power button up top here headphone jack
$80 this is an active digitizer pen that means it has a battery inside
and we'll show you that later so the flyer is a 7-inch Android tablet
they're about the same and they're both quite bright when they're set the maximum brightness
you see the 3d effect as you go through here on the camera
I'm not sure it's the easiest thing to control of it
it's an interesting effect so here we're gonna take a look at the HTC software
it's my one they were gonna show you the unlock screen and this is interesting
its and lock ring pretty cool so on the bottom here we have
your menu button your back and this is for the pen
it's known they're taking application so here we are in the note taking application which
and we've actually created a couple of notes the user interface is largely self-explanatory
Corel Painter or one of the other painting applications like our traits
we want to go back and you know sweep you with color
so that's the notes application and again this does sync with
here gives you a bunch of public domain books for free
and you've got the cute page-turner animations and it looks like it
you can say we have a choice of 15 movies 15
I'd say it's a bit more stable and reliable actually done the Samsung Galaxy Tab
it's gonna be $4.99 at Best Buy Wi-Fi only available May 22nd
the only the only thing that holds us back from hardly recommending
HTC thought that they could do some value added by throwing
but just keep in mind that it's probably going to be into the road
and just about everything else you want to know about this tablet
Let’s take a look at the Gaomon PD1560 screen drawing tablet.
If you’re having these problems the solutions are in this review.
You get both so you can choose which kind you like.
You can’t tell from the video, but this tablet is lightweight.
Pull the slider at the back of the stand and insert the top two screws.
You can wiggle the stand a bit to make sure they get in there.
Done! The stand adjusts by pulling the lever at the back.
and plug the end with two pieces into the side of the tablet.
Take the three piece part and plug the power cable into the round end.
The tablet software doesn’t start up automatically, so you need to to right
Under Press Keys you can set the shortcuts for your ten buttons.
You may program the two buttons on your pen on this screen as well.
Use the dropdown at the top to select your tablet monitor.
Take your pen and press the red dots on the screen.
when you turn the tablet, versus a high quality monitor there’s not much change.
The tablet screen needs to be facing you for true color.
I’ve personally tried that I recommend you look into is the Huion Kamvas GT-191.
Find more tablet reviews at ScribbleKibble.com/episodes and click the Product Review button.
and yeah this is gonna be a fun little video so let's get started
so this tablet you can use it for signing online documents
I couldn't wait as soon as I got in the mail
okay so this is like a oh this is a clicker
I had to charge it and I'm guessing with this one
good guy this is like a bag of like little nips
okay so here is the actual tablet itself so tiny and so cute
let's just enjoy this speedpaint featuring some miku fan art that I actually drew
the unboxing of the package was really nice and it looked perfect
but not really enough for me to really get flustered and angry about
it's not really that big of a deal that's just me being whiny
since a small tablet it was has such a good quality
so if you're if you're starting out in art and you're buying this tablet
I really like this tablet and I really wish I got
I really like this tablet so I'm just gonna stop rambling
that are often double the price, sometimes pushing into the thousands.
The pen itself comes with a nice little stand, and requires no batteries.
On the subject of customisable buttons, there are six on offer on the tablet itself.
Within the software, you can set these globally or on a program-to-program basis.
if you’ve set up some custom commands that would otherwise be unusable.
this actually turns the tablet almost into a a little console
Alcatel are really good at producing nice hardware for a low price and the pixie
I hope you found this short review so thanks for watching
don't know what comes we it's we and finally there's an area to put the
there's the tutorial area with several bits of information on basic controls
then there's the different sections that you will be using more than others paint
there's the gallery area where all of your saved artwork is kept
nobody can finish a piece of artwork on this thing in 30 minute
it's a knight with a sword in a castle and a key and a dragon
there isn't a lot of tutorial on how to actually use the system
I made quite a few mistakes until I learned how to shade correctly
it's not a professional tool by any stretch of the imagination
I don't see much happening with the upcoming games like pictionary
who know nothing of the you draw program of the positives
there's no tutorial on how to use some of the more interesting devices
the target audience here is going to be kids and artists sports fanatics
I just want to say I think this is a great idea
the kneepad 3 is the latest tablet from the Chinese company
there's enough room to grip the tablet with your thumb but not too much more
the smartphone in my pocket measures in at 6 point 2 inches
Android 7 new --get which is a must for an Android tablet
there's no excuse why multitasking isn't available here out of the box with Android 7.0
it's just such a tease but what that said there are some other features
I found it to reform on par with the front facing sensors
that should provide an average around 8 hours of screen on time
if you are at all interested links will be down below as always
I can't even get half of an iPad for what I can get an entire
so let's get this disclaimer out of the way right now
I happen to be a big fan of tablets especially large tablets
that's why I bought an iPad originally because of the nine point seven inch display
let's take it whether you throw in the car and off you go
it's not 1080p but still is quite good for watching movies
okay it's going to come with the Iconia suite which will pull that up here
easy setup easy wakeup easy gadget easy tracking on there as well as you
I think this is a good value for the money it comes from
Acer Acer is a well-known reputable company not an unknown from some company
you never heard of number two it comes with a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core CPU
but it's still very very good for doing everything we talked about in
this video comes with bluetooth 4.0 wireless a B G and n Wi-Fi on it
eight five megapixel rear camera and a two megapixel front-facing camera
Android lollipop installed very snappy very responsive so for a hundred and fifty dollars MSRP
I don't think you're going to go wrong with this tablet
I'm going to show you this wireless tablet that is made by weon
in addition to all this stuff it also comes with some cables
this is a wireless pan that is powered by a battery inside
you just need to plug it in and use it at the same time
the other cable that is provided is the charging cable for the tablet
this is a wireless tablet and this is also powered by battery
let's take a closer look at that tablet on the top left
we have the power switch and below that our signal lights
there's one signal light for the wireless connection so once you turn it on
Wacom tablet this way on tablet is almost 2 times the size of this
and in this panel you can see the twelve buttons here
you can turn them off as well using these two buttons here
I'm barely putting the nib on their surface of the tablet
this is a tablet and it comes with its own stylus after
I find that the pressure sensitivity on the Microsoft Surface pen stopped working
let me close this fall and open a new file so now
I've switched on lazy Nezumi Pro to draw the same thing again
I stopped and the second line and the third line and let me move
there is almost no lack and pressure sensitivity works very well
the only downside to this tablet is the driver compatibility with Photoshop
and it's very convenient because it's wireless so yeah it's a good tablet
if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below
multi-touch display running at 1280 by 800 resolution making it also the highest resolution
you can see honeycomb looks quite a bit different than standard Android
we have the standard micro USB port and micro HDMI port
this is your charging hole right here and that's the microphone
it's not going to pick up fingerprints well as you can see
this part is plastic up here because there are antennas underneath and then
they can shoot 720p video quite good video in fact dual LED flash
which feels really good when you're holding their device it's kind of natural your hands
so you're not going to be running out of space anytime soon you can see
feels like it's all about over here for a size comparison
this makes a lot of sense if you're gonna use the neurons accessory bluetooth keyboard
this is the same one that's bundled with the Atrix $189 dhoklas keyboard plus mouse
you can still put shortcuts to people contacts and applications and stuff like that here
this does not make phone calls however over the cellular network
so it gives you a panoramic view of all of your home screens over here
I'm at it and that's done when you're done just hit the home button gone
minimize this is your home button to bring you back to the home screen
you can look for system updates there you can see is running
Motorola verizon really haven't loaded this with any applications in them
I put on here you do get of course Google Marketplace Google Books
we're gonna take a look at the YouTube player which is pretty awesome
TVs look here for all sorts of videos also very responsive pick something
no problem full screen so this is this is YouTube player this is YouTube mobile
rather and it looks really good on release date there is no Flash Player 10.2
I would say given how the Motorola Atrix with a dual core Tegra 2 perform
the brightness set the day/night theme text size line height oddly
so it's gonna play right in a YouTube player New York
Times front page videos tend to not be very high quality though so
the movie the project and drop more movies in here to join them together
we'll show it to you very large birds under ten display so yes
Angry Birds good news is here obviously runs perfectly in fills the screen next
I'm going to take a look the 3d game Dungeon Defenders
this really makes use of the Nvidia graphics and dual-core processor
I think it will look at one more third-party application here movies is Flixster
it's it's much better in fact so you see right here
I can actually type two-handed as if I were touch typing very nice
our we're going to show you that by using the Atrix ism HDMI cable
the one actually that came with the Atrix for some reason
we have our Android desktop looking mighty fine on a very large screen TV
gaomon sent me their 15.6 inch drawing monitor in exchange for a review
also if you're interested in buying the tablet i will leave a link below
i believe wednesday so it's been sitting in our garage for a few days
so here's the box and they have this nice little illustration on the front
i'm just gonna move this traveling case away so we can look at
yeah wow this is really big and it's probably really nice drawn
okay let's pull the drawing tablet um they have this dial wheel
wow pretty cool oh and also as you can see they have um 10 expressions
um when you compare it to the size of the tablet it's actually pretty small
um all right so obviously here we got the stylus or the tablet
um let's open it up and see how it looks and feels too
so wow okay that i actually really like how this the stylus feels
this mainly happens when i'm using a really big brush on fire alpaca
we like your style and we just want an honest candid review
you know budget's good but i don't want you know completely not to trash
reminded me of my old google chrome laptop that i had a few years ago
lots of people saying they resolved the issue with little bluetooth speakers
so if the sound begins to bug me i'll just plug some of those in
sometimes that must be weird but uh it's fine the swiping and scrolling as
it's decent quality for low end specs and a very low price
so now i'm going to run off the specs for all of you
so you can connect it to a monitor for direct video output
maybe not that last one but you know it does a lot
i charge it that night and it wouldn't turn on again
it should be priced less than what the purchase price was
i did buy a case and screen protector and immediately use them
with color and clarity speakers leave a lot to be desired
so she said it should be priced less but that was in april 2019
they wanted to send a replacement tablet but he had already been refunded
eventually he received the tablet has used it on a daily basis for two weeks
finally i'll add that my contact with dragon touch customer support
two-year-old guys don't buy tablets for two-year-olds give them a book
she doesn't write very well because she doesn't read many books
just fine attached a screenshot of a third-party device hardware info app
the sound from the speakers is very good for this price range
replugs didn't fix so they were just literally the first top reviews that came up
so what were my final thoughts about the dragon touch k10 notepad
it doesn't move with great speed and agility but for 99 dollars
it's you know what it's like guys a few years ago
so let's not pretend that it's going to work for you
i did play around with the video camera capabilities on the front and the rear
i do all of that on my phone so for me
stauber canvas size that i use is 1920 by 1080 pixels
i use sony vegas pro 13 as it is very simple and easy to use
i'll probably upload the whole thing soon once i finish it okay
time for the tablet review xp pen deco mini 7 wireless
honestly what i like about this tablet is it's very portable
but if you're from the philippines you can follow at experiment page
I'm gonna supply some links to old Satori graphics videos that are based around
Wacom tablets as well as give you guys the rundown on
and you're even going to see a few scuffs on my
one tablet is one of the most basic models of any
tablet is ideal because it bridges the gap between developing logo designs on paper
however if you're like me and use a laptop a new
I found that when I draw with the Wacom splash one table
H 10 H 610 Pro v2 friend of mine mentioned that she has this 610
she's had it for a while and she really loves it so yeah
I don't know what those are hmm I guess we'll find out see the pen
I found in an old sketchbook I was flipping through a little while ago
I just found it and it was unfinished and it just looked good to me
I'm just trying to put them on a blank page at this point
I'm sure and probably all of them are easier than what I'm doing
I had to start over again because Photoshop just completely froze on me
so that's a very promising item that I look for because screen
there is only one gigabyte of memory which is quite limiting for a Windows tablet
that's a standard amount for these type of devices does have front and back cameras
this keyboard does not need any type of batteries or any type of power supply
why getting the task manager up and showing you folks its performance figures
it needs to space so don't put too many applications on
it was really fast and that will definitely be your best option
if you're going to be looking at expandable storage for this unit what
I'm gonna do now is load up Google Earth which I downloaded last night
if you go full on pushing down in the middle it seems to be okay
I'm currently at 27% battery life and it's showing about of hours 16 minutes
I don't really know exactly what the total battery life is gonna be like
if you need it you got it okay as far as the web browser goes
it doesn't excel very well in web browsing per se because generally if when
I like to get a tablet with good web browsing capabilities
it's definitely worth the 56 dollars for my purposes at least because like
I hope you'll find this review to be informative for you
you're fated with a big beautiful tablet monitor covered neatly in a protective sheet
so here we have the power adapter which comes along with multiple regional power plugs
I bought it from Amazon so I have plugs from everywhere
and here's the stand wrapped all snug in a thin foam sheet
Here I am forcing my boyfriend to do everything for me
it's like magnetized so you can set it to like different heights
here's some saying that it's a nice sleek material and it's also very sturdy
this tablet works as a second monitor instead of like a like tablet
it only works with the pen stylus so just keep that in mind
I noticed that was kind of wonky when I when I started drawing with it
that's that is touch for your finger that Scrolls and zooms is very choppy
I kind of wish that's a pen which is kind of like a hard plastic
was the same kind of like velvety material that the rest of it is color
it feels really really natural drawing on it also one thing
I recommend this tablet to anybody who is wanting a cheaper screen tablet
it's really comfortable and it's definitely a nice start one thing
I'd like to throw in is that I really do wish that
I'm going to leave the Amazon and liuyan link in the description
thank you all for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye
