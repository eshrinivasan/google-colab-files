care sort of backlight on there
we have a few more specs to talk about
like i said has three gigs of ram
the box doesn't include a lot
it's a very good quality tablet basic android build
so that's kind of neat it does auto rotate
i'm just going to click on this video here
see how fast that is
we'll go load a web page
let's go to this little car page right here
we'll be able to kind of see that right
now we've got an interior spot
click on one of these buttons
that was the backup camera
let's just click on google maps
see how this loads go to google maps
do a little pinch to zoom
it's like i said it's very solid
the other thing to talk about would be the camera
we'll take a little picture here
um it does work fast
i just have to hit the right buttons there

i'm working on a rick
so yeah so that's it guys
thank you for watching my review
olds but you can get it for 119 years
here is quite nice inside
and what's a bit set
US dollars I kind of expect 16 gigabytes
but that's not what we are getting here
there's a micro SD card slot
so if you want to
where we don't have it
end devices of all the performance is pretty good
you can browse the web smoothly surf
YouTube and play a couple of games
I got around 350 points and in the mighty quadtest
I'm not sure with cheap tablets
we often a stack with the
the same goes for touch with
it's not as overloaded as it used to be
he just won two years ago
it's actually quite nice now overall
well it's not that much room
that's missing which is great
that's a pretty pretty good battery life
I always do the same battery
hours just over nine point five hours
it's a very good result overall
you get a good build quality a nice display
the performance is not the best
then it's a very nice tablet all right
hello everybody this is my MSM
fire seven tablet for view here is the SD port
it's the heart just so you can have more data
there's a power button over here
this is the charging point
then we have the jack for the headphones
because it's very simple you can
if you're gonna get this tablet for a present
I make that mistake the first time
you just plug it in here
I love this salad and I'm really happy with it
it really helps entertain my kids
they also when they're driving around in the car
you're like two big pictures of things
it's a very good way for them
that's all the apps if you're clear
you're now to be able to see anything see you
there's no it helps with you
that helps you fall asleep
I like this word right
yes you can see you with your thumb
oh and then you can have different profiles
were nice enough to send me a review
copy of a brand new gaomon pd
1560 drawing tablet rolls right off the tongue doesn't it
i also gotta say that
the monitor itself is pretty responsive
we're ready to get started
i now got the sweet
it's nothing you haven't seen before
it comes with all the cables attached
but i can't find them
Android tablet this is Dells refreshed
v ARS g 1600 series graphics core
also onboard is one gigabyte of ddr3
aesthetic definitely doesn't feel cheap either
and power button on the right
edge is where all the action is and here
the tablet on the cradle it charges the device wirelessly
configuration devoid of bloatware thankfully
but that's really about it
that's a little bit roomier
it's not quite as tight
what we've noted here however
is that the physics scores show
s4 in the rear view
make sure you stop by hot
hello everyone and welcome back to the friendly horse
you're all winners on this channel
let's run through the nitty gritty
here's the box and as you can see it's a
it's a rather nice box
there wasn't much in the box you know
obviously there was a whatever they call it
let's talk about the build quality now
the first thing that struck me it's quite heavy
i don't know if you can see that
there and then you've got two sockets here now
this isn't a 4g lte tablet
it feels you know good quality
i'm gonna give it eight out of ten now screen
i was impressed by the brightness
it really does go nice and bright
well we'll give it a 5.
um but you know it's what it is now ram
so that's good for a budget tablet
that's good i'm gonna give that seven
maybe an eight out of ten again now
the weak point of this tablet is the processor
that is the weak link in this device
and i'm only gonna score it four out of ten
i don't know if it's just this app
but there's very few settings you know
picture size is 13 megapixel on the rear
i'll give the camera a six out of ten battery
uh it's got a six thousand
i think that's pretty average
it's okay it's not good
you know it's full android 9.
not one of those go edition things
it's the full android 9 but that's it
know certain websites vanco matrix pad z10 android tablet
it's got a nice bright screen
you know three gigs of ram fairly reasonable cameras
nicely built um you know
but you know if you're looking for something competitively priced
that does the job then
yeah i think i can get recommend it
it's this Gaoman s620 tablet right here
that's what my main research was when
alright so you get a warranty card
then you get the cable
the pen and this pen is battery less
I mean nowadays all the newer stuff
it's nice and light very comfortable and then you have
I mean my hands are average size
I think you'll be fine too all right
and then here's the actual tablet
it came down to two tablets
so what makes this a good tablet
you're drawing and right now from my research
the most high-end ones have 8192 levels
and that's what this thing has
I have the artistic talent of a tree stump
I think this shows enough of how it works
I'll have a link down in the description below
you can check it out
thank you for watching if you like commented subscribed
I appreciate it helps me out have a great day
hi Rosie good morning and welcome back to
and that's we're gonna figure out it right now
but this isn't a tablet
I'm gonna show you in a bit
it's a simpler stand but same thing here
I prefer to sketch with anyway
is this little character inside the scroll wheel which
we have the case in which we'll find the pen
the pen itself is a little bit shorter than a
click to bring up my brushes in
15.6 throw the cables are pretty much straightforward young
not exactly sure what these things are but
I assume they are part of the Holiday Edition
you go enjoy now since this is a review
we have an active area of 344 by 193 millimeters
the pressure sensitivity is 8,192 levels
the tilt for the pad is 60 degrees
the pen is battery free in the shortcut keys
I'm starting out in Photoshop
the surface feels a little softer than what
if that makes sense not a bad thing
it's just a little bit different
I didn't really have to do any calibration or adjust
the contrast the standard settings works
well it's pretty much the same as what
I have the keyboard next to the tablet
this could create a nice workflow for summer but since
I'm stuck in my old ways
I'm going to stick with the keyboard
the pen feels good in my hand
it creates this gap between the two points
it only really affects you
it's one of the most beautiful
I forgot that I was actually switching
tablets this is a good thing because it means the
I need to get the job
so that's the review of the XP pen artist 15.6
this tablet is a really good value
thanks again for checking out this video
i love it because it looks very clean
you can download the drivers
this is a welcoming card
pretty handy as well right
the pan has a very nice grip right then
it's very smooth on gen bot
i can do my writing
i can do whatever i want on this jam board
i don't have ones i couldn't test it for you
um so that's uh zoom
now let's move on to um photoshop right
you can see it's very smooth
you can use it to scribble so far
i think it cost you less than 200 ringgit
see you in the next video you
hey what's up guys this is
it's got a great great viewing angle 178 degrees
you can look at it
basically from anywhere with basically no distortion
so that's really really good now
IPS displays do have slightly less vibrance
in fact it can reproduce a 16.7 million colors so
I mean maybe 10 inches away
I guess some people might want it brighter
but this thing is not those things so
I think that's not a problem at all
the the glass is perfectly smooth
it's not the kind of screen protector
where the entire thing is sticky
I know some people prefer it
I actually like the the smooth glass field
but that's totally up to you
it's really not a big deal
now one issue with that
the inputs are toward the bottom of the display
GT 190 that I've used
I haven't had that be a problem in fact
I don't have any issue now
there is a hinge for the display
stand which if you fold it all the way flat
I don't have an issue with those
some people have got could but for me
I don't see I haven't seen at least in pictures
I haven't used any other display tablets
it does connect only in the middle of the unit
I suppose it depends on how you have it
I wouldn't worry about it
I think that's just fine now
Express keys which for me is not an issue
it has a few buttons for monitor settings
we probably should talk about the pen
so you actually get two pens in this package
I haven't been able to test that yet
it's pretty much standard for these kind of tablets
I have an issue with for these pens
I don't know but that's something worth mentioning the Pens
do have two buttons on them which are assignable
also the last thing to mention
is that within this package
I guess you could make the argument
you're going to want to use the artist gloves now
your hand will move smoothly across the screen protector
slide your hand across so having the artist
Club in there is very nice
I mean I guess it could be nicer
it's not quite the same level as my television
the buttons all press well so
I'm very very happy with it
I couldn't be more satisfied
practically speaking is that when technically better
I don't know but at more than doubles of price
I think I'm very happy with it
I'm thoroughly satisfied with it
I'm very happy with the product
link is in the description below
I have new videos up every single day

I'm bringing a new video today about a brand
we also find a manual of instructions
a cleaning cloth and a half glove with this set
this one has a different design to what
we see nowadays a nice detail
is this protective case for the pencil
the tablet monitor is 21.5 inches
it's better for a static
use at your usual workspace
it has no buttons for short keys
everything looks fine so far
everything works properly and the touch feels
nice pen pressure is also correct
I've decided to do a redraw of a drawing
I feel like I've improved a lot
and it's thanks to the opportunity
I recommend it to all of you
less would probably not be as effective
I feel so satisfied with artisul D22S
it gave me no trouble, worked perfectly
fine and the size is just awesome
drawing in just 3-4 hours compared to drawings
almost 100% true to reality
the results are extremely pleasant
I have to comment about the device for now
so you should definitely check it out you
hello everyone in this video

it has a lot of features packed into it
and that's something that really stands out excellent build quality
i love the back bit
it has the power button and the volume control
it does charge up a lot
so take care of the tablet when you buy it
the cable is not that long
generally this is a brilliant tablet for gaming
brit is brilliant for web serving for anything
unlock weight of this is 525 um grams
so it's not that heavy
so you've got all the features like android
i went from the registration
i skipped everything to the main menu
and it's already used up eight gigs
now let me go back you go
it's a tablet that wouldn't overheat has amazing build quality

Oh plop and floppin I
Buland put up to join blend blend cat
what is going on guys
Greg Oh Stevie this is the Vanco matrix pad
z17 inch tablet actually runs android 8.1
which gives you about eight hours
the screen resolution is not that high
which goes for that one goes for 50 bucks
this tablet goes for 65 bucks
another thing you might want to do on
here is watch videos now
it's ok not that loud
it's a single firing speaker
the viewing angles are okay on this
you can definitely see the screen
it's scary with this guy
oh you got me but yeah you can see it
plays the game fairly well
it has the search bar with the microphone
two is a little bit interesting
you also have a back button home button
so you notice the normal ones
all that kind of thing that you would like
I said I wouldn't probably take any photos with it
that was with the front camera
I would think for somebody that loves to read books
it runs a lot of the same
it does have more storage on here
it's just an overall in for 65 bucks
it's don't expect a speed demon of a tablet
you're not going to get that
it's gonna be a tablet
it's not what it's going against
it's going against the Fire tablet
I'll see you down the road Poots
hi guys and welcome back to another product review
you may recognize the name from the past
N 1 2019 Edition tablet
we have the tablet itself
we have an instruction manual
we have our warranty card with all the repair information
there'll be no charge whatsoever
okay so now we've seen what's in the box
that's one of the latest versions
Oreo and it's absolutely fantastic
and a pleasure to use
it's a brilliant feature and white isn't featured on
they're saying ten hours which is absolutely fantastic
they've got fantastic battery life and unlike other
I don't know if like me
an absolute mission to put on screen protectors
I think you're getting a fantastic tablet for the money
you're getting nice large screen
take care bye for now
promo s is a tablet operating system
I'm also running this on developer channel software something
69 is because we get this nice touch screen friendly
there are front and rear cameras
I wouldn't really recommend using them for anything
Arak chip our k33 nine-nine processor it's a six core
we can open up a couple of tabs here
it's not what I meant to do though
I've used it for Netflix
like use it for YouTube
now there is a multitasking button
here and there is support for multiple windows of chrome
you have a couple of different options there
now it's a stylus device and so
so let's go ahead and switch back to portrait mode
I'm not really sure what's going on there
you can change it to others
I need to choose input with a pen
so it's kind of a slow way to enter text
Google's a quick draw web app
this just runs in a website
let's just go ahead draw a beard
okay that should be a little bit easier oh
palm rejection is a little bit finicky
some apps seem to work better than others with it
you can use it for reading
so here for instance is an attack on
they're relatively easy to reset if anything goes wrong
I have a whole separate video
I'm running beta Channel software
but it includes a pen it includes the full
it definitely has a feel of a work in progress
I don't know it depends
that was a tablet specific device
I use a relatively inexpensive
wow what's this a tablet review really
there are hundreds of these out
what are you doing get up okay
just watch the video all right
i've tested out a bunch of tablets and i've deduced
about what tablets i like
this tablet was way too
i couldn't even see what i was
drawing part of the screen just didn't work
chibi actually made a really good video
about what huion tablets are actually like so
their tablets look really nice
and it's not a huey on tablet
the tablet is really nicely packaged
the glove is also really nice
the cables are very easy to set up
my huion had out the back
it's a really good size
the screen is really nice and doesn't reflect anything
you just download it off
the website restart your computer
it works really well when drawing
it's got such good pen pressure sensitivity
it just feels like you're doing naturally on paper
i found that it works almost perfectly fine
just like my old tablet
it just didn't work well but only for the pencil
i messed around in the driver
i used this tablet for half of this map
you should really go give it a watch
this is a really great tablet especially for the price
okay thank you so much for watching
Adelle and this is my son Jacob
hi we are from our family
it's a 7-inch Android tablet
it's got this protective bumper
its splash proof it's got Wi-Fi bluetooth
it's absolutely brilliant one thing
you set up a parent profile account
uh you don't have permission to use apps right now
once you're connected you can actually send them pictures
you can send the messages you can send emojis
that is a lot that is a lot so what
well calm and internet matters bottle
you might be wondering to yourself man
is that really a tablet there
I'm um I'm opening the box
it's a very small tablet
which does require one triple-a battery
go to the website and get the drivers
this is kind of weird for me as you
anyone who's watched my videos before knows that
I'm not very fond of graphics tablets
and that's what this is
I'm used to which is I think you can see
yeah this thing right here
this black bit over here
here you see behind me
it is a monitor it lights up
osoo which is a kind of a
I've never played it and then I guess
the H for 20 apparently has three buttons on it
three resolution is four thousand lines per inch
it's got a report rate of 200
who's like trying to you know do
I don't think this would be your main tablet
I actually would recommend taking a look at this now
you're directing of the kids no
I'll make screen tablets um but anyway
if you enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up
i mean i just love it
i mean this actually rolls really good
how fast that came up
look how fast that loads
uh internet connection just really nice internet connection
let me see but i mean it goes through
i mean for that size
um i mean it handles the memory chips
i was going to bring up my netflix
i mean it there it it doesn't
um it's just a robust little tablet
i'm really impressed with it
they want that organic feeling of writing
you have of course the remarkable two tablet
you also have replacement tips for the stylus
it is 4.7 millimeters thin
the experience is nice for me
i wouldn't complain that oh this doesn't feel nice
now let's talk about the actual interface
it's a bit like a notebook but on steroids
so say you're done writing your thoughts
you are in the minority
it still caters to that now
i use it every day multiple times a day
she wants one so everybody i've shown this to they
it doesn't feel like using a samsung tablet
i think would just help everything
be in one place overall
i think this is a great device
without going overboard it is definitely pricey
like one is my diary
one is for youtube video planning so
that's pretty much it for this week's video
if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up
i really like this tablet because it's small
it's a lot and it is nice
it's soft straw as you can see
i really like the fix tablet
besides you can draw on your cell phone
i never was able to draw my my cell phone
welcome to tau to connect today
this is a 7-inch 800 x 480 screen
capacitive screen has a 16 29 widescreen ratio
are these three buttons here on the bezel
there's a home button mini button in a back button
unfortunately they are not backlit so in the dark
you're not going to be able to see these buttons
so you would see it's a basic
it has some apps listed here on the bottom
this is the responsiveness of the screen
the responsiveness is not really that great
and it's definitely something that's very disappointing
i'm going to use skyfire
it's going to make your your interview in
now it's just loading here
okay there we go okay
let's just go to the New York Times website okay
we have had experience obviously with the epad
their is no flash again
that we're having with the responsiveness of the tablet
okay here we go alright so again
it's a two-point no it's doesn't support
let's go back to home page
usually our internet connection is not this slow
I guess there's a lot of people on online today
just for your information and let's go back there
we haven't had any issues with that
let's go back to again the home
we're going to show you the multimedia functions
well don't have any problems again
the external speakers do work well with music
didn't have any problems with that now
I'll show you some videos here
well no problems at all at least with this file
this is the under power processor
that just really has a hard time processing this
i think it was a 1.3 version of the app
in here again you can see how pixelated it is
it just gives you a poor resolution of it
but that's very limited in here
the any other browsers accepts a stock browser
obviously there's not many apps here one thing
unfortunately it's it's disappointing $300 for this
the quality is very good on this though
I must say it does appear to be glass
thank you very much for watching talak connect
you got a speaker on the back as well
it's just got kind of like rounded edges
uh so i do like the design of the pocketbook
it's nice and comfortable to hold
the the onyx is much faster
they have the exact same ink
uh screen the new colladio plus screen
the puck look a little bit slow to respond here
yeah totally different colors on these two
so one thing about the onyx is it
so let's just keep that down for this comparison
i got the saturation halfway up
so let's load up a different comic here
it almost looks like the colors
it has a lot of ghosting
i actually have a setup to minimize ghosting
you still get quite a bit of ghosting
how different the colors are on these two devices
look at this completely different color
ghosting problems on the onyx
so yeah the refresh is definitely better on the pocketbook
you don't have control over that kind of stuff
so let's talk about the text
here's sort of a similar layout with the text
when you're using just a regular ebook we got
the front light turned off right here
they have a boldness option
you control the contrast separately from boldness whereas the pocketbook
i've kind of find that it's just too thick
different color on the onyx
i say it's a little more neutral on the pocketbook
i tried it with a capacitive stylus
it didn't work very well
you had to press down really hard
they have a few different reading apps
you can install on this
that will make the uh comics a lot faster
thank you guys for watching
thank you guys for watching goodbye
and you have the back in the back
I would explain that on in the video
so yeah they stopped buying boxing
this tablet with my knife here
ok go cut the other side
oh oh the whole box comes out
yeah as you can see you
it's like a box inside the box with inside
of course um oh this far
ok this is the tub itself it is pretty heavy
pick this out see here or just patience
um let's start by buying unsealing
the tablet itself okay so
and oh yeah it smells like plastic all right
Oh son of a okay
so let's start by dripping okay
it's like so so got the back
oh wow that is stiff right there
that's how far it goes
I don't know you could hear this
it's like this crackling sound
wow it sounds weird but yes
it's the tab itself before
display of 800 by 1280
we also have a 0.3
we have nothing on the other side
we have the second speakers on the top
we have the front camera you know for some reason
megapixels and in the front was 0.3
we have the two rubber grippers
where are your apps are at
it did not work with this video so
I'm guessing this is meant for music playing
this these options will not work only the playing pause
we also have the mute option
I do not like about this mouse
since the mouse pad is a bit jet-lagged
now let's test out the web browsing
okay as you can see here
I ran the game pretty decently
I'm pretty sure if I kept on playing this game
I got around 2 to 3 hours of gameplay overall
this tablet did a very decent job
but is it really worth $80
touch max 10 running google android
inch ips screen really great specs
we've also got just at the top here
we've got the power on off button
apart from a couple of speakers at the bottom
i don't want that on camera and here we go
we are unlocked so it's just a passcode unlocked
point is an extremely extremely good price point
now you'll have noticed lately
i like covering these budget devices
it's mainly the google apps that are pre-installed
a good selection of apps pre-installed on this also
the screen does go very very bright
let's just pop this brightness up
i think it is an ips display
it's pretty good viewing angles
you can also see that screen rotating
actually let's concentrate on this a little bit better
nice nice build quality as well
i really do like the build quality
the primary build quality on the side is plastic
you've got some grip along this bottom edge
so some nice texture there
this is well worth considering
it's a really nice experience
stage just removing the screen protector overall
so this is the drug dragon touch max 10
i think it's a very very nice budget
pocket friendly android tablet that still delivers a great experience
nice size screen and overall very impressed with it
then this is well worth checking out
so that's it for the review

this tablet to test out in review
my thoughts and opinions are 100% honest and my own
the tablet comes well packaged in a nice box
there are a few different bits and pieces
a drawing glove is also included
I've placed a layer of plastic over the tablet screen
the tablet does come with a screen protector
the tablet is 10 inches
the case felt pretty well made to me
it protected the tablet really
the pen also feels really nice in the hand
it's very similar in size to a regular ballpoint pen
Play and things like that
I very much enjoyed working in Autodesk
it could do everything I want
it even had a line straightening feature which
I used when I did the line
art portion of my drawing today
there's always a little bit of time
I liked that the pen was small
it felt very comfortable in my hand
it felt very much like a regular pen
I'd prefer a rechargeable pen
the tablet is meant to have palm rejection
you don't want on your artwork
I found this feature to actually be very good
not all apps and brushes are pressure sensitive
the tablet definitely did have a little bit of lag
it really didn't bother me
rotating the canvas was definitely slower once
is that some of my lines of wobbly
the screen resolution was not the best
you can sketch you can watch YouTube
I think this tablet is really good
I've been as I mentioned earlier
then this tablet could be a good fit for you
it's not going to replace my
I think it's really good
I was very pleased with its performance
I could create sketches and finished illustrations
it was nice to work on
my name is alex and welcome back in today's video
so this tablet is powered by an octa-core cpu
i feel the screen looks great
the colors are nice and vibrant
the viewing angles are really good
i'm not a big fan of drawing on tablets
it is a bit on the heavier side
so if you'd be to compare this to an ipad
we have a 3.5 mil audio jack
so it's a good thing that we have dual speakers
so let's hear that is hello
this is a quick example
well that's not the case with this one
everything works pretty smooth mostly taking in consideration
you can also do some multitasking
if you want to do a split screen you can
i've tried facebook on it
i was also able to play call of duty now
it's um found your location
it doesn't seem um to lose it
the tablet also supports dual band wi-fi so of course
this tablet offers really good value
i've tried maybe like four months ago now
i think this will do great all right guys
hopefully you enjoyed this video
hey guys the CTA Prime back here again today
if you can get it for the right price
I'm not expecting much from this
it has a 10.1 inch screen
it's known as a smart stylus
Celeron sticker is really bugging me
it's not an extra battery
that's not a good sign
it'll disconnect the keyboard from the tablet even when
point one gigahertz but we do have a burst
it's 802 that 11n Wi-Fi plus bluetooth 4.0
and this whole system is running
is this keyboard not working even at $80
plus there's a copper pad on the back casing
you might notice some fingerprints here
PCIe mode the only time
this device does have dual stereo speakers
it is before we get into the testing
I figured I'd test out some PC games
at least that's what afterburner saying
I can never get sound out of HDMI with this
I turn as much as I could down
we're getting average of 24 fps rocket
this is actually the Windows Store version either way
it runs great on this little chip
set moving over to some emulation first up
this is just a harder one to run along with
there's not a lot of
she can get on YouTube
I had right out of the box
so that's pretty much it for this video guys
just let me know in the comments below
stuck at home me too
we all are social distancing
means staying at home at least
I get to work from home
my company is still functioning
I'm very grateful and fortunate for that
I'm such a bad liar
okay so let's pretend pretend we're surprised right unbox it
oh yeah hey you can see my camera rig
okay and look at that
it's already set up for me
there you can see the camera alright
thank you for indulging this lie
speaking of which headphone jack someday these will be history
I actually have some time
1280 by 800 resolution a 10 inch
it's about a hundred and forty dollars on Amazon
so you feel like you're reading a newspaper
it's much more readable than person than it appears
here it doesn't come through very much on camera
there's also a mode for eye comfort
this happens with most devices
she looks five years younger doesn't she
I swapped out my trusty
the screen is responsive even with gloves
it's got a strong build
it feels good and solid
the same thing happens on my s10 so who knows
so you might need a universal case
I can't really hold that against this tablet
it's just my fear of change
the camera falls a little short model specific accessories
thank you so much for watching
Bell you know usual YouTube stuff
ask and you shall receive
you guys asked for a more basic
the ink pad is using the same
so this one's actually dipped down about a millimeter
the onyx is a fully fledged note-taking android
google play enabled device with audio and video
let's get started on the two here
it is very apparent it
both of the glow lights are off
this is the exact same shot
we did see in our tear down
you don't want it too dark
they're using the exact same screen
you can sideload in your own
they look very very nice
the flush screen has nothing to do with it
they both look absolutely fantastic
we covered the three basics
the pdfs reading and manga
in this video we're gonna unbox and review the van
Keogh matrix pad s8 edition
Keogh matrix sa tablet is powered by a quad-core CPU
Samsung which has all this bloatware in general
I'm very impressed with the software experience
it's very light and compact even at 8 inches
it's very easy to hold on one hand
I think this is a really good budget tablet
it handles all those tasks quite well
it's not too big but it's not too small
it allows me to see what my camera sees remotely
that's it for this review of the Venky
OH matrix patent s8 review
now if you follow my channel you know
now i like that form factor
i reviewed the thinkpad x1 tablet
that is up until now i took delivery of this
we're going to get into it now
i'm not being paid by lenovo
i'm not being sponsored by lenovo
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
lenovo is not getting copy approval
this unit was purchased with my own money
i did not receive a review
unit from lenovo pricing starts at 1097.40
the pen and keyboard are included
let's find out what you get inside the box
let's open it up now
this is typical thinkpad packaging
we'll get to that in just a moment
it's a usbc power adapter and it's pretty compact
it uses one quadruple a battery
we'll get into that a little bit later
taking a look at the keyboard
i'm really impressed with it
it has that legendary thinkpad style keyboard with the trackpoint
it also has a precision touchpad
and it's working well so far and yes
the magnetic connection to the keyboard is very secure
you won't be losing it anytime soon
and speaking of the kickstand very rigid and very sturdy
we like to see that especially over the long haul
hopefully that will stay that way and here
they have a very similar size and similar footprint
a little bit larger display
this is an excellent keyboard
that is the sim tray for the optional
jack moving over to the right side is the kensington
this is the front-facing camera
this area is look at all these laptops
look at the boxes just thrown around
you know this is the life of the tech reviewer
don't mind the mess that's going to change
gotta say that all right
let's check out that display
it does get bright at 390
nits has really good black points
it also covers the color
well you're looking at 92 srgb
no complaints on that front working really well now
the pen doesn't stick magnetically to the side
and that's thanks to that
life that's something we'd like to see
and that's really fast now
don't expect it to be a major powerhouse
they're two front facing speakers
let's wrap it all up
what do i think about the lenovo
i love the included excellent keyboard
we get from the thinkpad line here
i don't think but this is really an excellent competitor
i really liked it a lot
what do you think about this bad boy
it's got that think pad quality now
it's got the magnesium alloy chassis
i like the battery life on this
you can pretty much count on all day battery life
i really like the camera on this
the rear-facing camera can do 1080p video
that's the lower powered tiger lake processor
let me know how i'm doing
i'll do my best to try to make that happen
lenovo includes its magnetic keyboard
and it's active pen too with the tablet
so you're ready to go out of the box
the backlit keyboard in general
you'll probably have trouble using it outside on
what's new is in sigh
1/8 gen intel core i5 processor
you'll get slightly better battery life
i still made to some other tablets that are slightly
but keep this in mind as i'm talking about them
but with how crazy this year has been
i reviewed last year inside of the box
you get the tablet itself
a bit light for me personally
but that's offset by the overall
i really like the surface
feel of this tablet more than anything else
i've used so far even my ipad pro
do make this tablet stand out
i also feel like the four express
keys is a form over function
the drawing surface is really
what makes this tablet shine installing
the drivers was also incredibly easy and xp pens
ui is pleasing and intuitive
i'd say that the drawing experience feels quite nice
the tablet also boasts android support
thank you so much for watching
hi everyone this is teo from
yes i have already revealed the g
let's unbox this quickly to show you
what's inside this is the warranty card
this is a thank you card and this is
some finger smudges from my hand
this is the metallic back
the build quality is very solid
this is the most premium looking and feeling tablet that
I have tried from 3 on
this is the box with manual and driver
that has a pen and a wireless receiver
is that a charging cable
this is a charging cable for ten
let's take a closer look at the pen case
this is a very solid pen case
you need to plug this into your computer
the red light will show up
I have already installed the driver
and this is the track pad for the track pad
I think is a good choice
all the basic finger gestures like pinch to zoom pan
just dial it up or down
the default value is fine
V Photoshop cs5 on the Mac
very nice pressure sensitivity works really well
I cannot be any of you
NT it was quite bad
but now it's actually very usable
this is ought to be illustrator
cs5 pressure works very well
this is MIDI Bank pinch
Pro pressure works here very well
there is no lack here
strokes tapers smoothly and secure strokes
it doesn't work with me
Bank so that's one glitch that I found this
is this cheat pressure books here as well this is
so that's the problem here
it's the same problem with MIDI Bank pain to prove
this is taya sweet catches pearl
and you lift up your pen suddenly there
I think we need a pinch to zoom in
I think it's a good choice
I really like to use keyboard shortcuts
the physical shortcut buttons here
you're charging the tablet so that's quite real anyway
that's the end of today's review
I hope this video is helpful
see you in the next video bye you
let's take a quick look around here
we've got stereo speakers which are on the back here
I said there's a couple of nice touches there
there's also a few custom asus
we've got support for pinch-to-zoom webpages load reasonably quickly
we go and in terms of video
I've had no problems with Netflix or YouTube
viewing angles are pretty good
so it doesn't really matter how you're holding the tablet
you should be able to see don't know
some people might lament that it doesn't have a full
HD screen held a reasonable distance from your face
you're probably not going to see a huge difference
between this and a tablet with a 1280
we ran a 1920 by 1080 screen
that might be even more appealing
I like where Asus is going and I like where
you're probably not going to notice much especially now that
lets you run full-screen immersive applications
I think that's the way it should be one thing
I think I forgot to show here is
there's some things to like about it
there's a lot to like for $1.99 budget
alright so let's start so it's quite small
let's see the box is really nice
that seems like something nice to start with
price is about twenty-five twenty-five dollars
it's thin you can see but it doesn't
yeah that's about three four feet
nice nice holding for the pan
what's really nice about the depen
I've seen they all need a battery battery free pen
we got nice and this is not an actual CD
download all right so one of the things
I found it quite nice
you can do anything light
I simple when I paint in Photoshop
you know it's quite impressive
I have two two monitors
that's what you see here right now
I use both monitors all right
so let's see how it does in clip studio
it feels just like a regular tablet
I understand you can also play games with games
that is so definitely a nice little tablet very versatile
I would definitely keep it as a backup
the pen feels really nice and big closet
it needs no battery no charging whatsoever
ren and welcome to another tablet review
let's just jump right into it as you all know
i've been using vague tablets until this day
i was quite surprised to see two pens
both stored in their pen pouches
it has a very nice feel to it
clean your screen as you should here
which is the hdmi cable
i swear they provide so many nibs which is insane
i don't even replace my nibs often
but i ain't complaining though
remover onwards to the tablet
it's a 11 by 6 inch display tablet
i love the design and its thickness overall
so these are the contents
you'll get when you purchase this product
i'll link it in the description down below
let's move on to the driver
it's just one driver installation and no matter
i'll be finishing my paintings
which is ya boi kaiman from doro hedora
they provided an extra pen
it's not one of those like screens
that is very slippery and stuff like that it
now i'll be listing down some concerns
would i recommend this tablet
i love the product definitely recommend to any beginner artist
you can ask your relatives as a christmas gift
what made you start doing digital art
or what inspired you to do digital art
I need to treat one thing first
that is the charging cords that it comes with
I recommend doing it that way
I'll go ahead and unplug this
it just doesn't quite sit in as it should
I don't want to fit into certain cases
you just take the casing off
the cutout on this is superlative
I own quite a few silicone cases
how well do they respond
click they respond excellently superlatively so nicely done
it is good and clear
you get your general games
because this is huge as you can see
it has eight gigs left with
I'll go into my written review
it was pretty rare to actually have these budget
kids headphones paired up with it
so you just go to settings go into bluetooth
it's already paired and all you do
is you simply leave on your Bluetooth
so it's a one thing
these particular headphones are actually
they're either you know market for kids but they act
I have had value in kid
and boy can they get loud
you're going to want to look at the instructions
I did which is really unusual for someone like me
who's you know gone through hundreds of headphones
but that's for the FM transmitter
it's just nicely done its depth out of the
this is the third pair of kids headphones
I've evaluated and this is definitely without a doubt
I mean these are some upgraded kids headphones
this is actually a nice
it's emphasized ties but with some bass punch to it
it's good pair of headphones so between the two
I have to applaud context here
a lot of forethought went into this
you guys have yourself a great one
so this is the vankyo matrix z1 tablet
maybe your 40 quid 50 quid
it would have been a better price point
there's really not much to say about it
basically apart from the ips display
it's got good viewing angles and overall not a bad
it's it's not all right
tablet does its job but nothing special you
hey everyone this is teal from
Park Blocks calm in today's video
I'm going to review there's tablet
this is the sim bans
Picasso tap this is a ten inch
so the highlight of this tablet
so let's take a look inside
we'll take a closer look later on
we have a warranty card
we have the power cables and pulp locks
that's this little battery for the stylists
that's included this is the USB charging cable that's included
it's very convenient very easy with this
it doesn't make that have let go to sleep
this material is quite smooth and there are
we have this little clip
I do not see any replacement tips included so
I think that's a good price
I actually do not expect a lot from a tablet
this screen is quite reflective
this is a 10-inch screen on the front
we have a camera on the back
we have another camera as well
we have the logo on the back
this tablet is a bit thick
Android tablets that I have used before on this side
we have some buttons and pots the power buttons here
the volume buttons are here
there's another speaker on the other side
though this is the 3.5 mm audio jack
so it's actually quite responsive
this tablet will auto rotate so these are the specifications
reproduction is actually quite good
the viewing angles are quite good as well
the resolution is 1280 by 800
I would have preferred 108 opie resolution
you get we have cameras we have
all the way as we have any
Android OS tablet or smartphones
that's why my desktop looks like this
I'm going to use sketchbook since
that's the recommended app for use with this stylus
I was actually resting my palm
it doesn't work that well earlier on
I put down the department
and that's that strange stroke
I'm going to put that tablet in the case
Jeter it's not really that big of problem
it's quite responsive so when
I'm drawing at normal speed
I do not have a lot of jitter
here's another sketch that I drew earlier with sketchbook
this are how the lines will look like
you see all these dots here
let's try and draw something again now
I'm going to raise my palm on the case here
hot flow is definitely a nicer app
to draw with compared to sketchbook
I really like this app
let's try and sheet this
let's create some dots here
what though definitely feels much smoother compared to sketchbook and
I really like drawing with this app
sometimes there is still a bit of
Jeeter but it's very minimal
I think it's a bit difficult for me
the lines overall they are quite smooth
let me show you a sketch that
I think this performance is quite good
well I was writing this
there is slight lack but not for a big problem
so let me draw those slow diagonal lines again
this is normal drawing speed
I think it looks fine
it works wonderfully some of this apps
they are free some are paid so
life for this tablet is actually quite good
this is at its brightest in fact let me just
I'll show you how dim it can be
the responsiveness is quite decent
you can surf the web panning and zooming
so that's a good price point for those
the battery life is great
inch screen is a good size to draw on color
I think this would be perfect
Android is the Samsung tablets
and those are much more expensive
the drawing performance is as you have seen
let me know what you think about
this tablet are interested to get one
do you think it's good enough for digital sketching
I hope this video is helpful
see you in the next video bye
I post a new video every Friday
I received this tablet a few weeks ago from huion
thank you so much for sending me this
I know but this tablet is totally amazing
this thing is absolutely huge
ok let's do that properly
I have one of these
these are so so useful so uh yeah
so this tablet if you buy it off
Amazon which I will provide the link below
might sound like a big amount
their tablets tend to be super super expensive
they're like the Apple iPhone of the tablet market
they are really expensive and their quality is really good
go-to tablet every other tablet
I've used I had a Wacom Bamboo
this is my my favorite screen tablet
I love health than it is at the price
point is great and for the specs
model that run into the thousands
so this tablet is pretty big
it's about like $1000 so already right there
I think in this price range you should
it should have it and this one luckily does so
you know you can take it anywhere
I was touching on the screen
I'd say this is totally worth it
let us know what you think so
this is my honest opinion
thank you for sending it to me so
let's read the back of it
but here's all of the wording
this has already been cut open
i didn't is it that big
oh my oh my gosh
all right so it is the size
it's really nice as you cannot see in that angle
this is the first badge or is it
i don't yeah it is wait
no beach has a tablet
it obviously is fits on the tablet nicely
let's just see if it fits in there
i really like the felt pouch
oh i see a pen
yay i went for the pen
oh it's really nice so it has two buttons
oh and there's a glove
i thought that was only with the pro version
but that's really nice of jam on to include that
it's a bag inside a bag
i'm gonna open the bag inside the bag
um if i can yay there we go
thank you from damn on that
uh now for the pros and cons
I'm not sure how useful this could be
I guess you could use this as a mini PC
we have the Intel Zee 8350 CPU
this is a quad-core CPU
PC it's running Windows 10
those metallic legs can be used as a stand
it's not as comfortable to hold so for example
anything over 8 inch tablet
you're going to find the holes for the speaker and
I do believe that this has only one speaker
the speaker doesn't seem to get that loud either
now the battery life will depend from user to user
and how you use your tablet connectivity wise
I'm going to start recording the screen
we'll do a couple of benchmark tests
PC that runs Windows 10 one thing
not the display on the tablet
the maximum resolution and shoes
I didn't do a whole bunch of updates yesterday
we have four gigs of ram
I also wanted to show you the task manager here
we can see the CPU
it is being there somewhere
and we have 50 gigs
this is a resolution of 720p
I'm not sure where this is happening
but yet only among the words that
let's pick on the first one here
yeah not like great so
let's try this on just out of curiosity turn again
I'm seeing it's a black screen
there is no point in trying other ones
because you've seen there girl needs slow motion so long
stop call the and next
I wanna play a game for a couple of minutes
how gaming would do on this okay so
I'm using the keyboard and mouse
it's definitely not the best all right
sup guys welcome back to world tunes
the drawing tablet i've had for the longest
is this one also from xp pen
the other cap serves as a pen stand
i hope you enjoyed my little review of it now
i'm gonna do a speed paint
I used the translator :,,) I HAVE A TABLEEEEET!
Sorry, I'm still excited ...
Bring a pencil with its own
I will animate a little bit
because that's what amazed me the most when...
ok, class, let's see how well you draw hair)
meme of "soldier, poet, king" so ...
(Hispanic thing x2) make your investments u u
I wanted you all to see it too
the design is really nice in hand
it's actually different from the color in two ways
and since it's now a tablet it has a dual-core
but there are some things
I really like about it
hi everyone and welcome back in today's video
I'm going to start by unboxing
the first thing in the box is the tablet
it has an IPS screen with a 1920
by 1080 resolution there are 8 customisable
there is the pen that now
I'm always pleased to see these gloves
it's just one that you can draw on
I've used these practice pages
Gangwon pen I'm used to working with
it was also a little lighter as well
Galvan Pen and some of the other drawing tablets
I don't know if it is rubber
now this is the same as my other
it's a small tablet the working area of the screen
it's actually just a little bit less than this
this again is going to be entirely personal preference
some of you may prefer working completely flat
I enjoyed working on this tablet
it's another great product from Galman
Galman is currently having a big sale
hi everyone mahmoud is here
this is probably nino's medium-sized graphics
but you look at this tablet guys
the first thing you will notice is design
it has a very unique design guys
i think it's called the hook design
let's start um let's start with a quick unboxing first
this is the tablet box pretty colorful
they all are pretty similar to wacom intuos graphics templates
it looks like a good quality battery free stylus
it doesn't have a rubber grip but it looks comfortable
i like the usb cable
c and one micro usb adapter
let's start testing as soon as you plug it
the pen is not heavy enough
it would be great if it was heavier
the tablet and the pen shows a really good performance
now let's check the tablet pen software
at least for mac right
i believe you will find it
it's a very cool looking software
um yep everything works great
now it is time to test the android mode
the good thing is the cursor is visible
i know there might be shorter problems in samsung phones
your phone needs to be in the portrait mode guys
this is what you need to do
this is um pablo nino's medium-sized graphics
tablet it's about 50 on amazon
yeah it's a good price for a medium-sized graphics
it could be heavier but it's good
it does the job uh by the way guys
pablo nino's m has different colors
i'll be with you in another video about online teaching
it was heavy it was bulky
I was on have come back with the Amazon fire
however you can't just increase the internal storage yourself
how good is this tablets to actually use now
I found it to be fairly pleasant
it is in fact just a simple tablet
it provides a fairly decent performance
you've nothing to maybe worry about
I personally recommend the Amazon fire
seven well to be honest
that's entirely on what you need it for
I would highly recommend this
a 'but reviews trademark symbol
i still don't know how to pronounce it pd
i will review the tablet and then unbox it
screw your conventional review video methods
we do things different around here
it has a very nicely sized 15.6 inch display
that's larger than most phone screens
there are also 5 buttons on the side
one is a power button
now let's go over how to set this thing up
the first thing to do is assemble the stand
on the back of the tablet
there are four screw holes on the stand
there are four screw holes
you will be given four screws
then you use the provided
screw driver to screw the screws in
I think this is the first product I've ever received
where a Phillips head screwdriver was provided I loved it
it saved me all the time
it would have taken to find my own
this may all be slightly confusing
export tablet configurations and import ones
you've already made before in the work area
lastly there are the press keys aka shortcuts which
I am so very fond of in drawing tablets
mapping system now that that's all covered
I don't like it when tablets are smooth or slippery
I hope you all enjoyed that
there were no scissors on hand so
I gave her a small spoon to use
she made surprisingly quick work of the box
it wasn't more entertaining inside
the first box was another box
the items it contained were a note from
I had immediately mistaken it
protector that simulates drawing on paper
alrighty let's move on to some final thoughts
I don't like the software that goemon has made for
this isn't a complaint about the tablet itself
second isn't really a complaint
it's just that it shouldn't be marketed that way
lastly is that it feels kind of cheap
the buttons are plastic and they wiggle
the display looks very nice
I wish other tablet companies would include things like that
I usually use is very refreshing
it comes with its own screwdriver
lastly and very importantly it is relatively cheap
as promised here's my review of the wacom cintiq 16.
now let's get started so for the pen
the pen buttons started to feel quite loose
you have to keep pressing it until it does
each a pro of the pen is that
it's really nice to erase things
the screen is really nice and fingerprints or hand
prints don't really show up which is good
the screen also feels really natural to draw on
but that's just musing like i said earlier
i have with the cintiq 16.
all of them are rather minor though
i would have to restart the driver
there are some miscellaneous pros
the express menu isn't very intuitive
which is roughly around 120
i use a two-handed i found this rather finicky
use both hands for the keyboard shortcut
i didn't want to change them so what i did
ac 19 will come out soon
so is it worth it
the answer to that is a big
they're both at gleamie arts
see you in the next video bye
i use fire alpaca and imovie fire
alpaca is completely free drawing program
so let's go in right
because otherwise you'll have it moving
it takes a few minutes
i made this using a tablet from gaomon now
they have this seven day offer on at the moment
um it looks really nice
it's got some good hot keys that you can
it's very simple just with the driver you can
you can put them to wherever you want
i've never used a glove before
um with a tablet and it was actually quite cool
i don't know how i feel going for it
i don't know if i'll use it much or not
um i quite like it
it's quite it's quite nice especially as a beginner tablet
so yeah there you go and that's the video
subscribe if you want to
it's it's only a little bit a month
oh also the animatic that you saw me making
that'll be on the side as well see ya
Ranjit from tech to bus comm and in this video
I'll be doing a quick review of this Samsung Galaxy
this is the lock screen and to unlock the same
you just slide it and this
is this default home screen
I haven't inserted a SIM card in this
the operation of this tablet is really smooth
you can easily swipe between panes and it performs brilliantly
the interactions are done via these three buttons
that's the back button home button
the browser would load and at any given time you
so the user interface is really cool
I want to drag the browser shortcut window
let's drop this agenda widget
I click on the same and I leave there
I like the UI interface
so everything looks really great on this tablet
2 because of the sheer great resolution
let's go to tech me
me.com take also the on-screen keyboard is pretty good
this browser is how quickly it renders to their pages
also pinch-to-zoom etc is silky
smooth as you can see
let me open one more tab
let us go to tech to bus comm
I just click on the same and boom
I'm loading the same right now
actually you can load any
Android app on the tablet
it does not need to be a specific tablet app
you can also load them normal
what do you say keyboard
what do you say swipe
the what do you say
I just see I'm scrubbing the video
I have noticed the battery life
now some of the things that
I have with this tablet
the front-facing camera works beautifully with the same
so no shoes with that also
Polaris Office with this tablet
so you can open up
what do you say office files
so that's a great value
according to me now let me go back
also you get a notification like you are
I'd really like about this
look to this tablet this tablet excels and actually
it's also very similar but even lighter
I hope you found this video helpful
that's it for now this is
hello there and welcome back to the channel
today we are going to be talking about this
i'm going to give you my thoughts
having spent some time with this tablet
on the right hand side of the device
i'm not going to say it's brilliant
it isn't as good as some phones
overall i actually think it's a bit of a bargain
10 is well worth a look now
that is it for this video
i am really really impressed genuinely with this one
you are watching a little
TV with the brand-new Toshiba
now we have the 10.1 inch display right here
Android 3.2 installed which is quite fast
unfortunately the micro SD and the micro USB port
don't want to work right now
so and we can show you local
: data bar bar trailer 1080p
let's do it again exactly then
we don't have sound because we have the
HDMI plugged in right now
interestingly the eye tell of course has the same
I managed to break one
all the apps here are pre-installed
what actually would be the case right now so
you can see it here
you can even move it around
it knows where we are so
let's go to the emails as already
Android you can browse through your emails here
but that's actually not that interesting
we could try that that's actually
I'm not sure if that's in here
I'm like regular user I guess
it's pretty fast already showed you debt
we didn't register it yet
which looks like this so you can do your own
you can write anything you want
I don't know you have to use it
the calendar is also well standard
2 right now you can see here
you is a standard website actually
I'm sorry for that and we have the New York
Animalia TV my name is bars
goddess was the toshiba 8200 full test
take much watching and till next time tune in again
stick it in the post
it's just a little bit noisy
I liked the power adapter
it much improved from the surface one
it was functioned perfectly in screen
USP tree read and write speeds again very good power
IPS panel as the original
it looks like it does about 415
but you know really it is very good color
I think this is a 10 point
I'm honest I didn't do much gaming on this unit
I'm trying to load here
they're they've really come a long way and orti itself
try something a bit different and this table
I think weighs about one point
it needs the active venting
it adds exception little bulk
it's about three four millimeters thick
Farsight touch to cover so it's illuminated and and it
it really does work very well did
I add original touch cover
is you know this is very accurate you know
it's it just doesn't replicate like a full-size keyboard
the type keyboard is better value
run time about ten hours
I'm very very seldom getting any drawbacks
I'd say yeah definitely go for it
III enjoy the Dell product
Lumia I don't know I'll know next week anyway
we had a nice thank-you message from
Huion. No thank you guys.
that's a good feature little little wipe
I'm not quite sure what this one does yet?
That's a good feature HDMI cables, it's another cable
So they sent me this box and inside this box
Then they send me another box as a gift
Lovely which had another pen
I could draw with both hands.
and that's my hand freeze in the chilling
Like this is like a size of line paper
you use for like notes in school.
It's it's bigger than two of these
That's a lot of space to draw on
this comes in handy because they sent you four screws
you got your power cable
There we go okay now
So you can get drawn real quick first thing
you're gonna notice when you use this tablet
is you have a lot of room to?
Draw, it's a big old 21.5
Need to plug it in for like five minutes
that means two times the drawing
so you're gonna be super productive and you
Let me tell you my hand
But the glove solves it
well what else is there?
side button setup and a touch bar
I can look at look how hard I could press
two pens two footlongs one dream
KAMVAS GT221-Pro ten out of ten
I got to give it a ten out of ten
So thank you very much and don't forget to
SD card slot and headphone connector
I was also pleased to find that
you can get this guy on Amazon
I want to say that right off the bat
it's an entry level tablet
this would be good for your kids
this would be good for somebody
I'm not quite sure whether we're going with 7
I'm gonna mention the things that I don't like first
the resolution is pretty low
to be honest those are the two major cons that
I really don't like I'll show you the screen quality
it's not bad on the verticals
when you flip it a little horizontally
it washes out a little bit
you can do all these things
they're doing a couple different colors
I'll show you what they give you
this charge cable is your going to be your standard
USB to micro USB charge cable
so you are kind of intriguing one for the other
it only has half a gig of ram
that's where the slow down for loading
applications comes but not playback or not actual execution
I'm going to power this guy on real quick
it has eight gigs of on-board storage
I guess you can recharge it that way
but they don't supply one
you recharge it just by the micro
they give you a user manual
you can check out my www.cms.gov thing
well doesn't have any problems you know running
you know again a couple seconds
I'm pretty impressed with that
so let me go home here
I'll get out of that Temple
you can run these things
you can run 3d games on this now
it does take a few seconds to load up
that's going to be something
um you know no stuttering no nothing
it does what it's supposed to do
I'm pretty much when I jump
I want hit jumps and you know it does good
you know on games like this now
it looks how that plays back really quickly
this is for Star Trek
this is a 1080p video
I'll get rid of that
hey it'll work for video chat
I'll switch over to and you can see
I can watch YouTube media consumption and it all works
it's got you know the
Play Store is all there
it does have dual cameras
you can do whatever you want to do
it doesn't do such a bad job if you can
the wash out on the the verticals obviously not horizontals
Bluetooth then this isn't a bad starter
tablet so this was the irulu
this was luke from galaxy tech review
I've got the hair pad
the camera isn't anything special though
I would use this to take pictures on notes
millimeter headphone jack and a micro
that's acceptable but doesn't get too loud
there's a Windows logo which is actually Palmer
the keyboard is responsive for the most part
I liked a little flap to rest your hands on
run pretty smooth as well
I've tried modern combat 5
and it lags a lot
I also tried to play a game on Steam
Dark Souls was the only game I had
I had with this is the case
I also realized that the 5 pin magnets are weak
and it's excellent on my normal use
I easily got through two days
this is a tablet for you
this is Lisa for mobile tech review
it's plastic over here on the end caps
USB port here this does support USB host
probably in fact flexing which is a little weird
I know the thin metal
maybe or if it's actually a plastic
I suspected it just flexible metal
Arco seven here it is next to the iPhone force
I finally have to tap it
it doesn't have the full
Android Market also kind of a bummer
Arcos does provide something called the apps
Wi-Fi it does have Wi-Fi 802 and EG since
it doesn't have a cellular radio
it's neither very fast nor very stable
it's about as stable as an elephant on rollerskates
new firmware is but with the Archos 7
I'm not sure we're going to see much
you can see the available
you can take a look
not a huge number again
this is pretty much all stock
no too bad today only with the web browser
Internet access is not terribly fast
this is a pretty fast
we are about 25 feet from our access point
there is no pinch zooming
you have to be careful
that is the web browser next
we'll take a look at what
Arcos players are good at which is multimedia
the video player on here does a great job
this supports a variety of codecs
avi MPEG 4 stuff like that up to 720p
I'll crank up the volume of it
obviously it's not supremely loud
this is pretty good next
you can see it changing up here
you don't get a manual equalize
what you get on here is an alarm clock
the apps let the music player
you've got a photo frame function which is pretty cool
we'll take a quick look at the photo viewer
I would say bring your charger with you
Android app has been around for quite some time
you want to read a book just have it
there's no accelerometer on this device
we are switched into portrait mode
it's pretty nice and readable looking at
go figure so that's the
Archos seven home internet tablet it runs Android 1.5 and
it's very reasonable at $199
there are some things that are attractive about it
the the screen is fairly an unresponsive
the device isn't that fast
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
hey guys welcome back to clown fish
TV we have yet another yet
another art tablet digital art tablet
unboxing for you guys so
xB pen says the 24-inch unit which I loved
but they also sent us this brand-new 16 inch unit
so now we can compare
look at all the clownfish
so this is their brand new 16 inch tablet
they also sent us their mascot
how this compares to the 24 inch unit which
I just blew this off there
I think like you know it makes a good tripod
this is the stand so mom take out right now
we've got our box of goodies
yeah so we're gonna try this one out
I'm actually you know what to expect
got a click wheel and everything on them all right
so that's the tablet now some guy
I know we see a fox
I think it's a fox
so this is a colorable model
pull tab on them now
she's got dibs on this guy
I would be really roomis if I didn't
it's very much like a resin or something
so and she's supposed to be like bubbly
maybe they'll be your nickname anyway
Wacom we reviewed this a couple months ago
so you can kind of see you know
this is a 13-inch unit
this is a 16 inch unit
but what really surprised me
now this is again her
Wacom this is how thick the 30 inch
we reviewed it a couple months ago
you don't have to use a stand with it
it does have function keys on the side
it has the click wheel
the performance is really good too
I mean there's no jitter
I had no problem drawing it all
I had with this one again
I had the same issue with the 24 inch
XP pen was the driver
took me a little while to get this unit
hooked up now this one
if airplane seats were big enough
this is very portable other than that and again
I also love the pen
this pen is thinner than the other
I had a really good experience wrong with this one
I love that you've got the function keys on it
I had no problems right out of the box
I wanted it to do
there was virtually no parallax at all on this unit
there's no lag loved it absolutely loved it now
again it does have tilt the interface is you
it's a very compact unit so
maybe it depends and thank you to
xB pin for reaching out and sending us this tablet
TV please consider supporting the channel
please subscribe ring the bell for notifications
we will talk to you next time you
a lot of you guys always asked me
so we're gonna get started
let's get started okay so
I'm just gonna open the box first over here
I probably should have opened it like this
oh my god wait get out okay
a box inside another box nice nice
I didn't even know it was gonna be like that
I do need an exacto knife or wait do I
hooray we didn't need an exacto knife
so let's oh my god
I don't dry my hair okay
I don't I don't follow the rules
anyway um come on please
yes oh my god that was such a workout
oh that's cute okay okay
I like that card all right
Wow Sugoi oh my god
whoa whoa whoa and on an off button no
tablets have on and off buttons thing
am i right guys now
I'm just I'm just messing around okay
let's get this open wait
I don't get to open this part yet
alright let's put this on the side
it is hold on okay
here is the driver -
wow that's nice if you like
I'm unboxing like a kpop album
oh my god yes okay anyway
I don't know what's wrong with me today
I can't do a normal unboxing like everyone else
okay cute oh my gosh
I love how there's these little boxes okay you know
I'm a sucker for packaging
I love packaging and this
is it more in here okay
there isn't it right okay good
oh my god okay seriously
this is great because honestly like with the Cintiq
it wasn't even like this
they just threw it in there
they were like here you go
whoa this is really nice great job like
I don't know what I'm doing
wow that's really nice okay
it has some nice dots on there
yep okay easy easy easy
I first started drawing on here
it was just me kind of warming up
that's about 15 inches or 13 inches diagonally
those are the most comfortable ones
I started out with a small tablet
I would definitely recommend going with this size
yes alright so anyway the only thing
oh my god like it's a normal it's like
what's going on here anyway um
I don't even know what I was gonna say
I'll put the link in the description
I think it's like 120 right now on Amazon
and that's pretty good for a wireless tablet for me
I got my welcome for like a hundred
this was like four or five years ago
this one uses a little USB card
I choke and die right now
I don't know I really really like it
it wasn't even the the tablet that was bothering me
so it's like what do
that could kind of be like
oh yep this is a valid review
thank you guys for watching
bye bye oh yes by the way guys before
we unboxed a gaomon graphics tablet
it is the gaomon m106k pro
so let's crack it open and take a look again
just like the previous tablet
this has a really nice solid
look to it really professional looking
i love the silver embossment on this one
it just looks really nice
i love minimalism in graphic design
it's just really pretty so let's check out inside here
we have the main board of the tablet
it's really nice to see this
one also came with a really cool little
thank you note which i think is really sweet
it was really easy to install
i post on a lot of social media
it's by dragon touch right there
this is a 10 inch android tablet
it's called the max 10 plus plus size model
you know what i'm saying
has some pretty awesome specs
hopefully this will be the business you can see
see the dragon touch logo on there
it looks like we have a volume rocker
right there so pretty awesome
it's coming on right away dude
that's a beautiful looking screen
that is like true blacks on that bad boy
i mean that looks great
i'm going to show you here that the back here
there are also two sim card slots there too
what up let's see boom
it makes it so much easier than a fingerprint reader
alright so i also want to show you that
as expected it has an accelerometer built in there
is maybe just a little bit of lag on
it seems like the apple devices
i just don't see any pixelation
i mean the colors are super bright
everything about this is absolutely amazing
this is probably the weakest
part of this tablet is that the speakers are good
i've consumed a ton of video on here
it's really nice and simple
so this is a very big tablet
it's comfortable in the hand
the construction seems very nice
like an eight inch tablet
because it's a really high-priced piece of equipment
i think this is the one for you
so if you want to pick up this dragon touch
i think it's a really great big tablet
that's probably going to satisfy almost everyone's needs
I'll explain why shortly so stick with me for that
I was surprised how well the tablet performed
this was a quite a lot of fun
this tablet is fifteen point six inches in size
I'm left-handed obviously but yeah you can see that
the tablet has kind of a greenish tinge to it
you know you can see on the screen recording
it's fully black but don't worry about that
I thought they were absolutely great
they did certainly make me laugh
what the masked tablets were
we've got everything we want
it's got a fixed and built in
it's a small tablet though
this is a 16 inch tablet
this is absolutely fine now
this works with Windows and Mac OS X now
the pen is actually nice
it's got a good grip to it
I wasn't expecting which is one cable
now that's all one cable
there's an instruction manual which
they haven't used any of those old fashioned cable inputs
that does everything and they've used
I'm used to only doing for touches
this used eight to calibrate it
it did get it calibrated
the parallax isn't too bad
it was giving me nice straight lines
well you'll get a lot of use out of this
I was happy with this
it was giving me smooth lines
it was more or less absolutely fine
absolutely great moving on to the drugs first day
I spent about an hour and a half on
this is full color one
I was very happy with this one
I can't say the Pens amazing individually
the tablet does feel well-made
it's just one of those small things
it's just those couple of things
it's definitely a good tablet for the right person
now you can see the screen
it didn't bother me too much
I know his face looks a bit squished as well
that always happens when you're filming what you're drawing
let me know what you think below in the comments
is this something you go for
is this a drawing tablet that sparks your particular interest
what drawing tablet have you got
what drawing tablet would you like
does this tick enough boxes for you for me
let's say a surface book
this isn't anyone in particular
this is apparently what he looked
it communicated very well with the computer I was using
the rotating ring was clean
it had good movement it clicked
well a 15.6 inch screen for me personally
everybody knows that everybody knows
I talk to a lot of younger digitalized
I still only have that one application open
I've got a mega powerful computer
I've changed the tonal value of plants
face this is where really came to life me
I really started enjoying this pain
work on this tablet definitely
that's no offense to the powered life for me
working on a larger drawing tablet means
I can do it faster
also having tilt and rotate on my pen means
the tablet is pretty decent
let me know what you think in the comments below
what do you think of the tablet itself
I'm pretty happy with this
you could take it to university
I mean that's pre swish
let me know what you think in the comments below
is this something you'd buy
have you already got one
have a very good day
we have these drawing tablets
I'm gonna be doing some comparison videos
I've got here in the studio
welcome to panels and borders
I bought the Huey on back probably in 2013
that's still a pretty hefty price
Facebook and the responses are slow
save your money wait longer get wake up now what
I'm using right now to ink this piece of artwork
Bamboo tablet just a small one
I have never had any issues installing it
I've never had any issues using it
sure the next tablet i buy will be a
don't don't buy to avoid this tablet
it's nothing but a big head headache
forgive me on this one anyway
today we do a tablet review for kalman
i was contacted to do one
tablets i love drawing on display tablets
more than those that i just pen tablets
i've seen so far are those that are pretty heavy
built and basically cannot really fit my workspace
interesting enough expensive tablet brands
i'd have to comment that
i feel like there's something missing with the package display
tablets are easy to work with
gaomon sells tablet holders separately
this would probably help first-time buyers a lot
the installation of the driver is not that difficult
your tablet can work now
the colors at default doesn't really match my computer
would the lines look clean despite not having stabilizer on
how accurate does the pen go
i genuinely appreciate this tablet
what isn't really good about it
you already have a full set of accessories
maybe you could add just one more to make it
you know user friendly also
it makes my desk look a bit of a mess
it's light convenient and you can bring it everywhere
it only connects to a computer though
i personally recommend this tablet
this is my new tablet now
that's all for now for this video
thank you so much for watching
hello friends and welcome to another youtube video
i hope that you guys have been well
i am very excited to say that
today's sponsor is xp pen
i will be reviewing three of their new drawing tablets
that is in collaboration with line
unboxing of me opening up all the packages
bamboo tablet since grade 11
that was gifted to me by my uncle
that's my that's where we're upgrading from
the boxes alone are adorable
just put those aside there
oh my goodness it is so adorable
this is a protective film
we got the extra nibs the cutest little notepad
this is the best brand collaboration ever
so we've got another cover
oh my god guys i'm gonna die
okay let me one thing at a time
so we've got the nibs cable
we've got the big boy here
i cannot get over all these line
play themed items so we've got
i'm very very excited about this
we've got our line play branding on it
oh my this is the greatest thing i've ever seen
so this is the stand
i don't need a super intense incline
because i'm sure i'll get lots of fingerprints on it
that's nice all right and on to the review
there's no worries about that
i found that it was
the smaller tablet came with one as well
it actually doesn't really move around either
i think because of the way that they die
i decided to try and quickly
i think that this is a great starting drawing tablet
yeah i'm really happy with it
which of course is different
i'm actually testing out the glove
that's another thing that i really enjoyed
i find that my ipad
um because it's so small and so light
i think that this is a great alternative
they're at and also at many different price points
hey there in this video
we're going to be reviewing the XP pen artist 15.6
this is a display drawing tablet
my name is Kay Michael Russell
it's the first time that's happened
I've made it so anyway
it's it's a big box
I didn't notice right off
the main box is a big white box sorry
I've like I have no space here
so here's what it looks like in the box
okay so boring stuff first
let's look at a little accessory box
see what's in here and this is an actual unboxing
I have not looked at this
it's all this black stuff on black background
it didn't work so anyway
this is the plug that
I don't know about the other one
but if you want to
so this is the tablet
it's lighter than I expected it to be
it's got this cover on it
so let's get this off
this little sticker says please peel off this mask
I don't know if I'll clear on that yet
so you guys can still see okay
sorry so in the box there are
yeah and there's only one port
I think since where I left you guys
I'll put a picture somewhere
this is a first world problem
turn it off and on again and after that
okay and that's really all
keep looking over at the keyboard to see what
that's how used to working on a
some pictures of this too is
I don't know what the numbers are
I don't know how big of a deal that is
honestly you're definitely going to be what's where
I ever need to get you know when you're brushing
that's one thing or and so far so good
this is actually three $59.99
three hundred sixty bucks us on
I think that would probably be the equivalent
they're both about the same size yeah
I just to be very clear
this was not a sponsored video
they didn't pay me to do the video
they didn't give me any
I'm not really seeing them
plastic all the way around the bezels
this within this is srgb
that's the smaller gamut there
I realized that I actually misspoke there
there's just the eyeball test
it's not a big difference
it's the resolution is one it's like
for sharpness and image quality can ask my wife like
which is the distance between the pen and the screen
it seems like a lot relative to again what
if that makes sense you know so
make sure you're calibrating it
I'm just not used to
there is some kind of protective film over it that
I'm not used to working with
and and they they recommend not removing it
and then there's one that's like super stuck to it
now this is not a 4k display
okay this is a 1080p monitor
the stylist is very comfortable
it feels a lot like the
Wacom stylus that comes with the Cintiq
s' there's no battery nothing to worry about there
I have no complaints about that
I accidentally bumped the eraser button
whatever for you know magazines and that's your job
I could see and my know my monitors calibrated that
I was comparing it to so they were
I don't remember if I mentioned this earlier
I wasn't told what's a you know
this is not a sponsored video
it is powered by a quad-core intel atom z3580
there's a 1.2 megapixel webcam
the keyboard is a small chiclet style setup
there's a volume rocker and an app
slot for storage expansion micro
that's a complete fingerprint magnet
that were slightly faster than an iPad
make sure you stop by haha
Wacom for a full review with all the benchmark details
welcome back to another video so for today
we're gonna be doing yet again
artisol has sent me one of their tablets
which is the m0610 pro right now
yeah i said it right
article has not sent me only one though
oh gosh they sent me two of them
because i'm gonna be giving one away eat
i might drop the tablet
i'm gonna be giving away to my instagram followers
only though so make sure to follow me on instagram
also article and instagram as well
so yeah let's see if this tablet is good
i don't know let's find out
alright so unboxing here you can see the box
let's see if the insides match and it does awesome
then you can see the tablet itself
we'll check that out in a little
we have the pen case
we have the smudge guard or the artist glove
it fits my hand perfectly
some extra nibs for the pen
in case it wears off along with the nib remover
the tablet looks really nice
it has four rubber feet
i tried it in my main phone
i tried this one but it didn't seem to work
um it kind of sought as a charger instead
i followed the instructions as well but still nothing happened
um hopefully this works this time
okay yeah it does work
i don't know you can see it
so maybe it's just that but yeah yeah either way
it still works on the phone
well now let's get into drawing for the speed paint
i decided to draw millie
she is one of the gacha tubers
let's find the way together few
i swear we never and what is forever
wait another day to clear my thoughts
that won't be forgotten forever
feel it it's like i can't walk on the scene
the short cookies are really clicky and handy
it feels really nice to draw on
you guys see ya you
hey guys do Daniel Dodson tut vidcom
and let's talk about the
this is brought to you by my weekly podcast
HGTV for the first time indescribable
grab your pencil and sketch away
and you can't use your pencil in Photoshop
so that's going to knock it down
it's really difficult to sketch or draw with
you pick it up and paint
this one is super natural
I'm going to give it an eight and next up
we're going to talk about functionality
I should say you put the pencil to paper
right there on the tablet
the functionality virtually literally drips off of a good tablet
I've used a mouse since I was three years old
pat the wacom hums so nicely
I'm going to give this a 6 now for price
that's what it retails at so
beautiful and lovely has changed the way
my rankings are flat-out insane
how would you rank these things
there are other great alternatives to a
make sure you go ahead and like the video
are you going to get a tablet
thank you much for watching
Athena Dodson touch vidcom catch you guys later
hey guys it's the arts here
so let's get started first
i got this very cool box
that the drawing tablet is inside
you are going to be drawing with these are adapters
i will show you that later next
we will have the pen holder
this is the work area outlined here
okay how about the adapters
they there are two in case
one doesn't go into your device if both adapters
without the adapter should be your best bet
it works just practice now
i would give it a solid 10 out of 10.
you guys have a great rest of your day
see you all in the next video bye you
hey I'm Chris Velasco from Engadget
and today we're taking a look at this
felt beauty is the Sony Xperia z2 tablet
it's really minimalist so the same deal with the front
all you've got is the screen
because this is a waterproof tablet
I've taken this in the shower
we'll talk about that later as well
your power and your volume rocker and up top
we've got a couple things with note
we do have a micro
and we do have the micro USB charger port
let's talk about this screen
this is really the star of the show here
it's no slouch either since it does have the latest
I haven't seen any dropped frames
google play music through the
we're able to swipe through
Sony's media collection and download
whatever it is you're ready to move for all
I myself and very firmly in that corner
Stoney's is probably the least offensive like it or not
eg tablet is that it is dustproof and waterproof
that's an ip55 and ip57 client
keep your eye on this guy
it's physically almost identical to the z1
what is going on guys
this is a review of the dragon
sure on that on the charger
the colors are gonna pretty much stay the same
is it gonna be good
you know like gaming for instance
let's load up a game here
we'll load up asphalt 9 here
I think they it just performance alone
you can do a fair amount of stuff on this
the battery is 5,000 milliamps
and it seems you know fairly decent for the time
it's a 1080p display and a five thousand milliamp battery
I haven't had too much
you can see 32 gigs of space
the speakers are horrendous horrendous
you've got your volume keys up and down
you get your power you get your headphone jack
you have nothing out right there
nothing on this side at the bottom
you have a camera along with right here
this is a 5g tablet so
you can see that got a score of 239
and let's check out upload upload speed so obviously
I'm on an android 9 Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
which is the best processor
I think it runs really really well
I said because that the the sound on
there's no fingerprint or there is face unlock
which if you set up
it's not going to be secure face
I believe it's system and then you go into gestures
there's a couple of gestures in here
you can jump to camera by to quickly open camera
double press the power button
I'll sort of prevent ringing
you could use the speakers but they just sounds awful
yeah cuz you will not be home
I mean if you can run
now let's see if you can run multiple windows yeah
I guess you can run multiple windows on here
see you guys down the road
what's up guys it's will from tech beat
TV bring it to you a review
I'll provide a short summary
why don't we start and dive right in
alright guys is the review portion of the way
O's for Bluetooth pen tablet
this is a wireless pen tablet from
let's go into the actual pen tablet itself
you can make various adjustments
but let's go over the other aspects
it does come with a programmable keys
the battery is readily removable and accessible
it's right through this door right here
connections was relatively easy with this device
I have other devices that are connected via bluetooth
no interference know anything like that
so the connectivity was great
it says it's up to about 33 feet
I lost some an act
it was pretty good but other than that
no real issues with the connectivity
I'll use Photoshop it as an example
actually have the tablet self right
I use it on Phil right now
select the brush tool and what you can do
is you can draw various
you know lines based on the color template so
I'm going to go to maybe a yellow
I do have a ton
so you know you can sketch out whatever you want
look but you can write pretty much whatever you want
great accuracy the 2048 levels of precision
whatever you really need so there you have it guys
I got a bunch of replacement
it's the the nibs that were provided depending on
it's this gloss edge right
fingerprints were magnetized to this section of high gloss right
I'm the type of person
i believe it's 18 hours
you can just double check
between eight to ten hours
just be careful with it
I personally love using this now
but there you have it guys
that's my review of the way
we're gonna unbox and test two things with this onyx
color device seven point inch eight inch color ink device
we're gonna look at the device we're gonna unbox it
this is a place for reviews
good energy all kinds of productivity tips and just fun
this is a community more than a channel
let's open it up first now
i opened up the box that it came in
this came from china from books
this is i'm just not good at it
all the books products typically do that
this actually is a purchase from me
i did purchase this device
setup can be really tricky
you just jump in and use it
and then we have a books
typical books cover which i believe
is their little denim kind of cover
the packaging is is decent as always with their products
let's see how does this open up
it is going to be going up on ebay
the case is like hopefully
it's not a sticky case
let's see and it is not a nice little case
it's not bad little you clip in case
that's not bad and i
i want to get the initial stylus test
comes out normal like the normal box
we go kind of a smaller device
and that's just a bummer
i don't like to put on screen protectors please books
please put that on the factory
i'd actually pay extra you know i bought this device
i would pay extra for that
let's see how this comes off again
it's powered off right now
we have a power cable
so there's a charger cable
which is the stylus and i have other styluses
i do not like book styluses
it just doesn't feel good
um and then yeah so
i think that's got a little hole there for this
this thing that you can put it on there
we're going to do two things
we're going to do a writing test color test
see how dark it is
be right back and we'll get on this okay
we are back the device is on
we are ready to go
uh i think i've been pretty good
focus okay first thoughts on the stylus
i do not like it
okay compared to the remarkable two and other styluses
i wish books would do a better job
okay let's go ahead and look up here
it's a little bit brighter
the writing experience is not that great
it's gonna even gonna feel more
uh than the the stylus that comes with it
you can kind of see that okay
so let's go ahead and erase see if that erases
um but the writing experience is okay
i don't know if it's really going to work
let's go a different color
let's go like um gray
i just don't see that's gray
i mean i can make it thicker
let's make it a little thicker
let's make it real thick here but for me
let's go ahead and erase all this and see
the ghosting is a problem
too of kind of how they're going to work
i think they're still a little way from the color
can you see that right back there
it's ghosting when i push this
just don't do anything for me
that was the first experience
i don't like the stylus
the writing experience is average at best
let's see if we can play it
it's i mean almost watchable
let's go into regular normal mode and we'll move it
there is some stuff there and the color isn't bad
i mean it's again the ghosting you can see
it's it's just ghosting and i
let me go back to normal
i'm sorry maybe that'll help
this is my webpage and there's still ghosting on there
let me refresh the whole thing
i don't know what these refresh rates are
it's gonna be able to work right
it's okay like it's okay
okay so let's go back
let's see news and you can kind of see
they got a little bit of color to them
you can kind of see the coloring
i mean it's it's it's decent
um but they're getting there
i think coleto like three
um it's just not great
i don't think i'd use it
this is just like a regular review of me
will i use this thing
i'm gonna give it a week or two right now
looks like it's going on ebay
that's my rating of it
let me know but even in all the different modes
the ghosting is not that great
i'm going to have to keep refreshing
what do you want me to test on this
is there something you would like to know
is there a specific thing that you need for me
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
and this is the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet
grippy does shows some fingerprints but not too bad
obviously not a super thin tablet
I think that guy out like so now
this is an active digitizer pen
used as an entry duo sense display on the device
this pen is not a capacitive
stylus the front is a little different most
the operating system is designed not to use buttons
there actually sometimes a little bit annoying
maybe you'll like them on the side here
generally speaking slots are covered here
there's a SIM card slot
headphone Jack nothing up here
there's a sliding door here
that means you can use keyboards
mice flash drives we plugged in an unpowered
USB hard drive and it spun it up
this will also connect to the Lenovo ThinkPad optional keyboard
NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual-core CPU with a gig of ram
this guy is more stable
we do notice occasional slowdowns when using them
you can see we've got
Lenovo zone app shop over here
T uses for video rentals and downloads
least they have different icons to give you a clue
the built-in gallery application does a better job playing
not sure that's really necessary but since
Lenovo is trying to sell this
that kind of stuff is here
all this utility does is let you copy
it's not limited like the Sony Tablet
isn't that respect so here
I wouldn't call this the most beautiful or intuitive interface
and all this going to do is copy
scrolling is just fine so we have pre loading here
it's a little bit quirky
it's probably a bit more
of course this is over
the tablet weighs one point six pounds
Lenovo speakers and that's a good terms of size
Tab is so darn thin it's lots thicker
and here's your splash screen right here
Word Excel or PowerPoint document
menu edit view format insert and more
so say you want to edit
are you going to toggle keyboard
Lenovo has a really cool accessory
you've got three positions and it's firmly in placing now
well now we've got the a seuss
ipad transformer here with the keyboard dock in it
you've attached a laptop dock
it acts just like standard notebook computer
we compare the two keyboards as you can see the
Lenovo keys are a little bit bigger
they also have more travel and just more tactile feedback
CSUN that's a half cap of the screen twice
I'm not sure of this because of the enteric digitizer
we're going to take a look at the web browser
that's playing 360p inside the browser
it's a pretty large phone
inch display which is the same as age
we'll switch to full screen
performance is a couple of frame drops
so it's pretty much average among honeycomb tablets
tablets won't even let you try to play 1080p
high profile standard profile and peg 4 is a lot
we have a 1080p high profile
I think one of those reason other than the usual
hey everybody likes to make some money is
subsets rather what you can find on the Android Market
who have watched our HTC jet stream Android tablet review
Express for tablets installed here
I've already done here before
you can select a word if you want
if you print you get better accuracy
yeah honestly overall accuracy on this is about 70%
I don't have great handwriting
it is and does a nice job making your handwriting
look a little prettier than it really is
jetstream have a two button
stylus that does two different things
Nvidia 1 gigahertz dual-core CPU with graphics acceleration as well
I'm pricing for that though
I even announced that again
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
visit our website for the full review
hello today and welcome back to my channel
this is hack the planet today
I'm bringing you the RCA cambio two-in-one Windows 10 tablet
you're gonna find cheap plastic here
the screen of course is plastic
should you get it or not
my recommendation is no on this one
I do not recommend the camera is I
the volume buttons are here
you can't find any other deals
maybe this is for you
it does have a full-size
the you know at the bottom of the barrel
I'm sure you've seen that
Android devices you will not have this problem here
which by the way is not that bad anymore
but this thing is optimized to run high-definition videos
you shouldn't have any problem there
the screen actually looks great
the screen protector is still on this device right now
it does have a 1200 by 800 display
it does not come with office with an office license
you will have to pay for office with this
the keyboard is not a full-size keyboard
let's take a look at those
it's not a really well-built keyboard
but it is definitely a 10 inch
RCA computer I never thought I'd see a RCA PC
because technically these are pcs in the tablet form factor
I'm actually going to swap it out for a
so let's get this one unboxed
let's get this [ __ ] out of here
oh my god it's so big
ah i am so not doing that
maybe i should have done this on the floor
thank god i appreciate that okay
let's see what we have here
obviously they want it to be bigger and sturdier
so we're gonna have to peel this one
it's gonna be very satisfying
so the tablet is supposedly 22 inches or maybe 21.5
i think i'm gonna measure it later
it comes with this stand the manual
the driver manual almost like the driverless
you have your usbs and ah what's this thing
oh god i'm going to build stuff
help me and a bunch of screws
oh okay for the um the stand all right
22 plus is actually 21.5 inches
but it feels huge to me
i'm not sure if i'm too comfortable
it can become the engine of the pen display
that's cool and it's windows
it has chemically etched ag glass for visual performance
thanks to the anti-glare finish
the pen is enhanced with appendix 3.0
the performance of the pen seems good
major delays in the strokes
let's get some drawing done
according to the site these are the programs
i tried walking with it okay
i wasn't feeling how slightly it made my hand
this is probably just a me problem though since
one had shortcut buttons or express keys on the side
the canvas 22 plus doesn't have any shortcut buttons
the problem is when you do that
the colors aren't as accurate anymore
i can't complain about the colors
also here's something that's just weird for some reason
i have no major complaints about it
hope you liked this little review
thank you all so very much for watching
see you on the next video
my pretty darlings bye bye
hello everyone in today's video
I'm going to review the Pablo is 6
that was sent over to me from
Pablo the official retail price is us $79.99
the main selling features it physical chaka buttons
let's take a look at what's included
that's inside this zip back
USB data cable the pen blue quality is solid
this is a matte surface
hot rubber grip two side buttons
this pen is not powered by batteries
it feels really comfortable to hope
and this is the pen
stand that you can use to rest the pen
this is not a wireless tablet
it's really thin on the back
we have matte surface for rubber feet
the big 40 is very solid
the design looks very clean and simple
it's not too rough and not too smooth
one point six point one
is this extra Windows Inc functionality
Mouse functions mouse clicks to the buttons
drum performance is excellent on both Windows and Mac OS
Illustrator affinity photo affinity designer clip studio paint
Pro really bang paint and creat
are they all work really
they don't wobble basically the lines
they always come out just the way
I expect them to the performance
it's very predictable and I can press down
basically tap on a tablet to create dots like this
this is my two-year-old girl
Tiffany sleeping on her it
it's also not as smooth
another issue with photoshop is pressure
sensitivity doesn't work by default
so you actually have to turn on
they are very responsive so
the pennant does not support sensitivity
I am wrong maybe there is to test sensitivity
there's no need to buy this
we've all the various drawing apps that
I have tested except for Photoshop on Windows
it's always photoshop on windows
alright thanks for watching if you have any questions
let me know in the comment section below
I hope this video is helpful
see you in the next video I
and i find that they're actually quite enjoyable to use
this is called the innovator 16.
it is xp pens 15.6 inch screen drawing tablet and
that's totally fine which i think is really cool
i've actually never seen that on any other tablet
they're very pressure sensitive and whatnot
you can damage the components
that's why my very first tablet looks absolutely like brutalized
it's not like whittling down to a sharp point
i want to talk more about the innovator 16.
you're going to notice that weight difference
it has nibs in the bottom which is really important
please leave them in the comments
thank you so much for watching

I'll be reviewing a spy
ASIS the name of this tablet is called zenpad
10 model number is Z 3 0 1
M and it's an Android tablet now this Andrew
he also takes a micro
he can take at the top
I also takes a three point five
he has a five megapixel camera and the logos
okay so it does have a decent cameras
the speak is out the front
he has a dual speakers
that's where the speakers are
whoa it has a rich display as well okay incorporating
basically now as you can see is very smooth virtually
let me say go to that
if you go to saying there's you can see
he loads up very quickly as well
just don't think gig go in to use okay
the battery life is very good my opinion okay
he also has a boo in
model numbers p 0 to 8
thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
i've seen your comments your requests
will you all have been asking me for
i know what you want a successor
a new iteration and a series of mine
your words have not fallen on deaf
i've been a bit hesitant to do
any further tablet review videos
let's get right into it
we got the tablet itself
we've got the stand a drawing glove
you're like in the eu or whatnot
a tablet is kind of a pain
the overall build quality of the tablet feels incredibly solid
almost a little on the heavy side
it's a little bit lightweight
kind of feels a little flimsy
however the rubber grips on it are very very solid
it's only about nine millimeters thick
it has a screen protector
the pen itself is also interesting
i didn't like it but this one
wires would have to go down
it's a little bit annoying to deal with
it's not the worst in the world
i mean you can deal with it
that means that it's a very accurate color space
model the artist pro 13.3
i didn't have to adjust anything with my previous model
i had to fiddle with it a lot
the drivers are all familiar
there's a little bit more traction on the screen protector
it doesn't feel papery so much maybe slightly more plasticky
it's a little hard to describe
it's a little soft but it's not unpleasant
fortunately don't have that here
it has a very soft grip
that's very pleasant to hold
so is this a good buy
this is a worthy consideration
that does it for this review
but i did finish chapter 8 of my webcomic
i'm bad at ending videos
I probably don't like about this tablet
we're all free so the tablet itself
this is nicer from mobile tech review
8.2 it's available now on
Droid tablet and it looks just like the 10.1
Zhai board only well at 8.2 inches
take some micro sim just like this
Motorola likes to put their controls and interesting places
this is your power button and easier volume controls
now what does iboard 10.1
they put them on the side on the edge
and you've got the back panel here
aluminum very stiff very rugged
Torx screws there's like t1 or t2
Torx screws and they actually are real screws
they're not just visual rivets or something like that
and there are no screws whatsoever no
God knows how you take this apart
obviously it's not as portable
well there's the 8.2 for you
nothing customized there no integrated motoblur or social networking
and that means that things are
I conjure a little bit smaller text
the words are fairly small
this has a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core TI OMAP CPU
that seems to be the favorite for for
Nexus runs on that CPU
it does pretty well in bench just at the 10.1
not quite as fast as a 10.1
this is a four thousand milliamp battery
that's not a bad capacity
says a gig of ram
SD card slot does support USB host
and here we have the the old motorola
Motorola you plug something in sound
so we've got our flash drive mounted
you can get that for like half price
it comes with or without a verizon contract
the zoom was never cheap
10.1 has longer battery life
10.1 comes with an active digitizer
and that means it's like a Windows tablet
it supports both capacitive multi-touch and an active pen
not a capacitive teton in fact
here's the pen from the 10.1
we'll take a look at that
now that some of those things can be downloaded here
I find it kind of sluggish and well
Evernote's bundled and so is Skitch Evernote
that's the only custom widget on the device
which is pretty handy to keep track of
how much data you use
PowerPoint this this is the most full-featured version
let me just pick the video off the front page
and those of you who used
it's showing what's on and you can choose your cable
we have guide verses devices now
this is what the controller grid looks like
they support quite a few brands of AV gear equipment
that'll check out the web browser
W flash plays because plane is fine
LT reception this is decent
tablets are generally pretty good
we find those eye board
certainly can help with that
I would recommend the larger and 10.1
not just because it's bigger
they both feel reasonably fast
not super look at you
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review

and don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel
it's kind of a long story you know
he has a present for you come in Santa
it's that drying towel you've been asking for you
sorry he wanna know you sent me
dis like almost two months ago please

USBC card these fancy adapters for something
I've never had before in my life
this tablet has 11 different buttons
my right is redo while
there is a pretty neat hue on up
I generally really like this tablet
I've decided to try and draw something
it was kind of stupid too again
I guess that shows how negligent I am ah haha
hello everyone in this video
i'll be reviewing this gmac
m70 kids android tablet now
this is a budget price tablet
quality is not the best and it feels very cheap
it does have a front camera
it has a speaker on the bottom left corner
speaker is not the best the quality as well
it has the volume button and the power button
and that's about it so this is everything he has
that's pretty installed little pianist
it shouldn't be that bad now
it's already used up around five gigs
you still got the remaining demand for but for kids
you have all that control there
it's slightly slow but other than that
it's a tablet that's worth i'm going for
so thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
hey everybody it's lavender town and today
it doesn't have an eraser and it's extremely small
I wouldn't pay much more than that
this next one is the first
I'm going to be showing
this is an older model of bamboo
it's pretty much impossible to find one
that's not used now though
I was able to find a few on eBay
and lastly the field gets a 5 out of 5
it has really good pen pressure
and it's just a joy to draw on
I quite like the accent
color of that seafoam green
there's a power button on it
they changed the little charging cord to an L shape
it's kind of a small detail
they have their super clicky and satisfying
I think the feel is the best part
it's really nice that they had something to consolidate them
I noticed with this Cintiq
I'm also giving it full points on feel and design
I got this as a gift from my parents
thank you so much to them
but yeah that mushy stuff aside
you can find it for around half that price overall
this tablet works really well
I'd give the value a 3 out of 5
it's the CV 720 ug tablet
I don't think that it works anymore
it gave me some trouble with the chargeable pen
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope that
this is the tech tip guy and today
I wanted to make a quick video
8-inch dual core tablet that
it's dual core number two
two megapixel point eight megapixel
those are the rear facing is 1.3 megapixel
have you know they felt like
I didn't do the tablet justice enough
they had not had a problem with it
they are going to buy four more their family members
and and that's great it it is
it's a great budget tablet
this is not what that is this
is you know a budget tablet
not all apps are going to work on any device
I have noticed there is a popular game fan
another little thing with this tablet is that
I'm holding a camera right now
I can't really show you that
I've noticed using it tends to get hot
I don't know if that's true for just budget
you know some of the budget tablets are all anyone
I'm going to try to power it off
I can't promise it'll do it
this is the second one
I wouldn't even turn the thing off
oh I know what I was going to cover fellas
they didn't plan on supporting this tablet
there would be no software updates for this tablet so
I don't know who to believe
the customer representative they or the website
but who knows but back to for your money guys
it will more than manage to do that for you
I want to thank you for watching my video today
I really appreciate you stopping by
I hope to see you next time
previously they'd had some leapfrog leap pad um tablets
it's obviously much cheaper than an amazon fire
grown-ups tablet is the wrong word
i think is really really reasonable
i had both tablets set up
they can't access anything else
this is what i really love about this
plus app which i know is completely appropriate
so what's actually on there
plus tablet factual books story
books all kinds of things
this is a factual book about robots
all your child needs to do is tap to download
this isn't free-for-all youtube on here
so i really love that
that makes it really accessible
you've got harry potter there
barbie star wars disney all sorts of different things
so that makes it really easy for your child
as i said they'd had tablets before
but these were little leap pad tablets
they weren't like particularly advanced
they've done really well with it
so it's an eight inch screen
it comes with this super robust case
and um what's great about it is
my four-year-old is quite diddy
um it's oh it's about 500 grams in weight
it has on off switch volume switch
it has a port for um headphone jack
so just normal headphone jack to go in there
um it fills up quite fast
there is space for an sd card
you have to go log into your adult account
put the sd card in
they can only have it
how many hours or minutes
i can even see what apps they last opened
these kind of arcade style tap tap repetitive games
i can specify how which parts of the device
i really really hope that you enjoyed this video
they're robust they're really reasonably priced
they are built to last
thanks so much for watching bye
hey guys your own apology
I did find something originally had $178
I found it for around 80
so here we have the insignia 10.1 inch flex
inch screen 32 gigabytes camera
I wouldn't be skyping with anybody on this camera
USB type-c port and micro HDMI port other than that
let's go ahead and open it up okay
I'm gonna flip this guy over
it is a really nice
I don't get to go with it
why not you know where this is going
let's see what else we've got
here's the other section of the box
I'm assuming this is yep
this was not a bad deal and then
I finally got to tablet up and running
the screen is nice and bright
the internet is fairly fast as long as you use
thanks to the prongs on the keyboard itself of course
but that's a given considering
the tablet is still supported for newer updates
it's already included on the system
I hope you enjoyed this review
USB cable along with this
and this is the place for your charger on top
you can see the unlock button
it runs pretty decently and which is
this tablet is great for playing some simple games
i played these games along
this tablet and watching photos is also quite smooth
this is a great and a moderately priced
hello director this is a review of the new tablet
I bought to replace my very dead
Hodel this is the Acer Iconia
these two models of this is the black model
I've been using it for about a week now
I do enjoy the front-facing speakers
although the speaker grills are not or a bit misleading
the speaker is about here
how often you're going to need that
I don't like having no app tray
so that's one the first thing
it doesn't matter easy snap
so that's what that's one of the bits in it
I do quite like that
I had the odd lag on the home screens
I'm not doing any hardcore gaming
just mainly boom beach and classes are really likening
so that's pretty much it
YouTube works fine streaming fine
I'd fairly happy with it
yeah so that is the Acer Iconia one
I got this towel a few months ago
it's got this blue a plastic cover on the back
we got a camera up there in the center
SD card slot here underneath this flap
it's a 1280 by 800 resolution screen
I do like the screen on this tablet
it's not as high-end as some of the other screens
I think it originally came with Android 4.4
I really do like this operating system
it runs nice and smooth
Lenovo is kind of custom launcher here
we've got some different things
I just got a set on standard view right now
I got to turn on right now
initially there was some problems with sort of the
it'd be like really quiet
I went ahead and just customized my own
some other things you can do in here
there's some different security options in here one thing
there's some other options in here
you can switch over to large text
there's some different stuff speak passwords color
inversions this is pretty typical almost tablets
who are interested in the benchmark
numbers should be done here in a minute
34 376 is the number for this tablet
a store score came in at 12 560
okay so the tablet has GPS as well
it's just not in it's not just a fake
the only downside with the screen is is
you can't view it with sunglasses on
Play Store taste nice and shoot very clear in HD
which one did I load on here
there's no issue with it with performance whatsoever
it's very smooth very clear
graphics look really good one complaint
I have about the tablet is
the camera doesn't seem very good
I don't know anytime I try to take
pictures almost always comes out slightly out of focus
it's got a 5 megapixel rear camera
I wanted to talk about with PDFs on here
people are wondering how PDFs lay out
there's just a big black space right here
smaller tablet does get scaled smaller
I kind of like how it handles PDF
that really is no waste of space
anything like that comics magazines so
check out the e-book reader comm for some additional information
Buy it was on special
it was $69.99 normally sell for $99.99
so if you go to your local
Dollar Tree in the electronics department
b1 - 850 this is the 16 gigabyte
Wi-Fi only model so no 3 or 4 G access
this will only work on the internet via
Wi-Fi running android 5.1 lollipop
in this tablet it does have an 8 inch
IPS screen 1280 by 800 so this is a 720p
if you are a die-hard gamer
maybe getting into the 1080 1080
both these cameras are total garbage
the front-facing camera is good enough for Skype
I would not vlog in or anything with it
you have the micro SD card slot
I must say the battery life on this is excellent
I was very very surprised at how long it lasted
I can get with moderate use
Best Buy and I think that was about it
yeah so that's basically it for accessories
IPS screen which is very nice
the touch the touch capability is very good
I'll go ahead and activate it real quick
it's got a nice fluid motion
these are just some of the apps
I have installed you got Angry
I kind of regret using that picture yesterday
but yeah whatever yeah so as you can see
and of course because it is android 5.1
Oh having this particular application open
it is running android 5.1
these are just some of the different versions
I said it's amazing to me
how long the battery lasts
I get I kid you not
that's the one thing that drives me crazy with these
there you go you can see
just got the one accelerometer sensor so like
you're gonna pay for it
I have the tablet laying down flat
you can see the various buttons on the side here
you have your volume rocker
have your power button right here
which is above the volume rocker very very typical design
next to that is the micro USB charging port
I believe that's a microphone
yes somebody send me a message
it's just a 16 gigabyte
I have a total of 32 gigabytes of space
don't expect too much out of that
get out lies and gentlemen welcome to draw with Gaza
I also asked if they would set up a discount
check out the link in the description
I never do anything for you because I just did
the five percent off discount
the question is how's the experience
how did it arrive to me
and how easy was it to set up
it didn't have that flexibility
you absolutely can do that
they also sent out the device with the screwdriver
I didn't have anything that I felt
I actually didn't experience that very much
the driver didn't have a double-click functionality
the device is eight hundred
you get out of the device
it's a tricky line to walk
I didn't find the device
help me back from what
so that's my overall impression of the huion
GT 220 I hope you enjoyed this video review
bang for your buck anyways
that is it for this video
I'm interested in your thoughts and impressions
you'd like to see me review in a future video
here's a link to another video
Jazza is proudly sponsored by Adobe
thanks for joining the arty party and until next time
okay so about two weeks ago
I could find on Amazon
I spend about 40 bucks on it probably
yeah so of course you know
it's a little bit slow its but again
I don't know if I'd really let them do that
this is really really cool that they have this
you know pre-loaded stuff here you just need
I didn't have to pay anything
I haven't learning notes so this really isn't art
okay so the other games here educational games
she liked this to see what this one is
yeah she'd probably like this
I don't think we've discovered this yet
I think it works pretty good
I don't really know what kind of expectations they had
it doesn't cost a whole lot of money
infant to toddler kind of age group and so
yeah and get it in pink or green
those are the specs on it
this might be one of them
let's take it out of the box in the box
we find a user manual
you get a plug-in charger
you have your power button volume up and down
are your stereo speakers like that
i just want to tell you
there's bluetooth is a gps built in
i've already had it boot up
i said this is an android tablet
that's exactly what this did
and there's all my apps just like that bam
go back in your bag and for games
i happen to like this one
isn't that bad at all
everything seems to work exactly as it should obviously like
i said it runs android
you have full access to the google play store
it's just a decent size nice tablet
there's nothing really special about it
that stands out it works well
it feels nice in the hand
here is a still picture taken using the front-facing camera
now here is a picture from the rear facing camera
these photos were taken in the 4x3 aspect ratio
the tablet can produce pictures in 16x9 format
these photos were taken in the 4x3 aspect ratio
i'll switch over to the back camera
and here's a video using the back camera
quality is okay for a tablet
it's you know really a tablet something
it does an adequate job
inch tablet seems to be a great deal
i've had a couple of those over the years
generally those are like your quote-unquote bargain basement
units out there but for something like this
it feels well built everything in it is adequate
there's nothing that stands out
they've become innocuous and ubiquitous devices
there's nothing wrong with it at all
we'll see you next time bye
hey everyone Leo bond here
the smart tab features a 1024 by 600 resolution
finally a clear removable protective case is included
and it's just like any typical smartphone case
you have three main sections
you'll actually need an internet connection now
the read and learn section has 15 different story books
you can pretty much draw whatever you like
I didn't try them all
I actually enjoyed the shooting gallery game quite a bit
I'm showing right now is called Prague poppin
it's a whole lot of fun
I could probably say about this thing
I do recommend this thing
so that's it for now as always this is
we're gonna unbox it first here
the actual tablet itself is very big
Photoshop Elements nice RTF workshop
let's check it out alright so
I'm here at my desk right now
I Photoshop started up here
which even bad lines you know
I'm just not feeling it
I think you guys should check that out
thank you guys so much for watching
I hope you enjoyed this video
please like comment and subscribe
and of course you're the best people ever forever
yes love you guys peace
which can go up to 128 gigabytes
if you want to with this matrix pad z1
which is pre-installed with the protection
cover on top of it and is a very lightweight
display the process of configuring tablet
you need to select the language
connect your tablet with wi-fi by typing in credentials
and it's all up and running now over the tablet
you also have a google play store from here
where first to start with you have a google assistant
now let's check out the video output performance
you're going to get out of
actually that's a maximum on this tablet for the youtube
isn't that bad at all if you consider
isn't that bad at all
uh and performance of tablet 2 megapixel camera
isn't that bad at all
you can see me very clearly
i suppose now here i have all the pictures
just been taken using the camera on this tablet
that shouldn't be a problem at all within the settings
and so much more in here and the response
time of tablet shifting from portrait into the landscape
isn't that bad at all
seems to be pretty much fast as well
that's about it nothing else
thank you again for watching this video
some of you might remember that about a year ago
Helion having one upped their game
220 220 get allies and gentleman
welcome to draw with jazz
I'm Jazza and in this unboxing slash review
another the last part of the video
this video can be nice and informative
this video is sponsored by huion
Perot as how you know that's professional because it's pro
I'm a freshman can use that
it's actually really awesome of them
they've given the coupon to 21
sure they'd be careful when you are
this is a really inefficient way of doing this
you get a double of the boxing today
lucky you two boxes in one bloody day
Yui on thank you for choosing
I really love about these guys is
they're actually incredible to talk to you
okay so in this box
I was looking for a cleaning cloth
it's just got a little bit of that storage dust
so let's clean up our lovely new screen here
they've got this fantastic protective
I don't need to wipe anything
so let's see how this one goes it's same
Stan mechanism with the the plate
so let's use this lovely blanket
nope that good step two do these
I've never had a problem with to be honest
I don't even know why sped nibs are a thing
do you guys run out of nibs
I've never replaced a nib in my life
but hey better safe than sorry what do we get
oh it even says gift
have you given me an extra pen
cool that's unique a spare pen very interesting now
I can actually think of useless for that
so that's cool on the other hand
I actually have lost my stylus pens in the past
once it's all plugged in
I thought it was kind of cool anyways
tab and you can find the driver
and you're good to go
drivers are officially installed into your GT 221 Pro
I also recommend experimenting with until you find something satisfactory
I like something sort of second from the bottom
I cracked open my custom
I was using this device running off of a laptop
I don't know I just do
you're viewing at the specifications also boasts a quick response
you've seen all of that but the goodies
I really enjoyed using to be honest
is the experience creating art on the device
the device was really natural to use
that's a bit of a bummer for me
I made a bit of a workaround
that doesn't need to be there
there are a number of significant improvements
let's sort of use the analogy of a cake right
I felt in no way inhibited
by its reaction time and responsiveness the pressure sensitivity once
I could do within two or three hours now
the cake is amazing now what
I guess in the cake analogy
I don't know what I'm so focused on cakes
they don't send you a cake
I've got to stop talking about cake
brushes photo references video courses and more
we're reviewing the goman m1020
that has some shortcuts which is pretty useful
it has a nice um quality
it's kind of like i'm sat in a velvet
um so here's a pen
it has a nice feel
it feels very premium something of quality
i must say so guys
um i'm gonna do a testing for you
so thank you guys for watching and enjoy this video
it feels very premium i can
photoshops are high intensive drying programs
you may experience lag and this is not our fault
what do you like about eyes
we post art related videos on this channel uh you
is it called dragon touch
i found out what it's called
oh well um so smells like plastic
no it smells like wet paint
my dog is scared of the vacuum
no wonder usually dogs are scared of that right there
oh no okay so this is the on button
i don't know what that is meat
meats whatever that is if you go on this
oh my gosh you're purple so that's basically it
i don't know what settings is yet
i think it might be here
hey everyone this is teal from parka
the design is very clean very minimalist
I mean remove all the items
let's start with the cables first
battery life is rated at 14 days
that's if you draw non-stop this cable
here is for the tablet
the tablet uses wire cable
this is the pen stylus
there's a cap in front to protect the tip
this cap is not able to go to the back
so let me just put this away
the grip section is matte surface does not attract dust
the grip feels good to hope
let's see what's inside this small pouch
and there are four replacement tips
K is a budget tablet from gum on the build
there are 12 physical shortcut buttons on the site
the texture on the drawing surface is matte
there is this cloth pen holder
I have already installed the driver so now
he watched shortcuts to the 12 physical buttons
I have already or sign mine out
is the stylus pen by the way
this pen has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
the default pressure works fine
you can change the buttons as well
this is the work area by default
let me show you how smooth it is
so we have some other brands of tablets
there's no lag at all
I have no issues with Photoshop
this is illustrator cs5 now for some reason when
I draw the first stroke
so it's on and off
the tablet is unusable with this app
I have contacted the company
works here as well very nicely
it's very smooth this is
Krita pressure works here very nicely
this is a finicky photo
this is a re sketches pro pressure sensitivity
works very well here now
that's because of the style of that particular brush
let me draw some thick lines by pressing down harder
I have contacted a company
I would say this is a pretty decent budget tablet
I have tested especially in Photoshop
it works very well too so overall
I think this is a really decent and capable tablet
so that's all for my review today
reveal the link will be in the video description below
see you in the next video I you
we have reached 10,000 subscribers
things like t-shirts and skills are classes
t-shirts like this one here
I drew and designed myself
the box is really nice
I'm very impressed with the box
I'm glad they give you that
it's good for portability up
next is a little box
this is the stand which is really nice
actually so don't worry about that
the glove doesn't fit me perfectly
I believe it's made for smaller hands
the screen is not laminated
so you will get a fit of parallaxing
the display and pen had almost no wiggle at all
I've tested in a while
what the wheel does all this
you can control in the driver software
it'll fit a lot of different situations
I again a few little gripes
things like not having the type see as one
connector is kind of a downside to me
I wish they had it all in one plug
I know a lot of tablets can do that
make sure you do some research you know
I'm gonna be signing off here now
my t-shirts all that kind of stuff
I thought we'd go through
we might do some drawing together
what do you think awesome
I will explain in a minute
so the pen itself is quite nice and fine
alright to turn your light pad on
the top corner is a little power button
is we pick which one we want
I've scribbled out on some computer paper
you can what the way that I would do
you can then get something like washi tape
I said make sure that's taped down
so there's no problem doing that
so the final thing that
while you're learning that the light pad makes very easy
you've traced over all of the bits
so now that we're done you can see
I still utilize this form
all the way up made them darker
I'm just making this up as I go
Yorick I've got distracted there
so that's the advantage of the light pad - so
I've had enough for today
I just get my form back there
I just realized but again what you want to do
I'll grab my piece of paper
it's actually a big bad move
Oh would he how to the moon
I think that's cute not at midnight
so that's your basic outline
you can then continue like you could decide you
so that's the light part okay
so now that we've had a play in a draw
yeah and the brand here is nebulous
it's really cool and give it a thumbs up
I give it two thumbs up
here's the asus memo pad fhd 10
it's got a 10-inch screen
it's actually a bigger screen than the new
iPad a really great screen resolution
that's nineteen eighty by 1200
the widgets are really good
the tablet to sleep is set for 30 seconds when
I have it set longer
quality is great resolution is really good
so it's really loud for a tablet
it has really good quality with the photos
it's also pretty lightweight and it has that nice color
I actually got a case for it right here
and here's a tablet in a true case here
it was a part on the side
it turns the screen off and you open
which they're the third largest manufacturer of laptops
the pen that comes with the star
i got stickers and sticky notes and a ruler slash
bookmark featuring your hearty friend brown
that's why i started teensy season
hey it's just a background
don't do that don't do that
i add a bit of chaos here and there
the box includes the pen tablet with 8 buttons
and there's brown coney and sally so cute
bookmark plus a brown pencil case
i'm not an expert when it comes to coloring
i don't know color theories and principles and stuff
i just do whatever i feel like
this is a great choice for working on the go
and it has brown in the middle cute
then you also have the gloves
don't forget to follow exopen and myself on instagram
but don't forget to send it on my email
thank you to xpenn for making this video possible
i'll see you in the next video
make sure you have a great day bye bye
Cintiq may finally have a legit competitor.
I have three Artist 22R Pro Tablets to give away
So this is the Artist 22R Pro, first impression:
it looks really really sweet.
And it's pretty light, you know?
This one definitely feels like a more premium product.
I mirrored the displays, let's open up my Photoshop.
Oh, it looks so great, look at that!
I researched some side by side
comparisons on a basic surface level.
million colors, it's the same amount of pen pressure
That's a lot of numbers, I know
Ugh! Which brings me to the best part about
So spec-wise, overall, on paper, as of November 2019
this is the best all-around tablet
Which I feel brings super healthy competition to Wacom.
Wacom is like the king of tablets, right?
I've been waiting for that but hopefully, I don't know.
One really big improvement about the 22R is the pen.
Some tablet pens these days
require you to charge your pen
But now they've caught up on
You know what, let's have her in the clouds.
And now she's immediately in the sky!
This one was another one
Look at that, this really helped me find the mood.
This one works as well too!
Maybe I'm gonna try to add this cloud back in
Somehow, you know just maybe like a little bit?
Ahh look at that! That's perfect!
Do you know what bats look like?
I don't think I've ever studied what bats look like
That's contrast between warmth and cool.
And then one awesome big light bloom- Aaah!
Welcome back! This is Amé, I really enjoyed this piece.
I think it came out really well.
And see what's the best one for you.
and if you don't like it, you can return it.
I'm kind of diggin like a smoothie
Woh! Oh my god! A smoothie!
Milo! See these guns, milo?
I'll go into that a little bit
you can usually get it for less
so that's what you'll see it on the shelves
this is the four gig model
RAM 500 gig hard drive
there's a second model of this
when you're watching this should ever be two gigs
touchscreen laptop no get them without the touchscreen
don't waste your time you know
I hate to say it
it's really just a gimmick so
I'm saying that I don't hate this device
you take the four gigs
RAM and the more storage
ISO pose I will quickly go through the multiple modes
I've got photos of it in the multiple quote modes
it's well if let's mention our multiple modes first
there's laptop mode which is a standard laptop
configuration you can see it here
it's a very attractive laptop
we'll talk about the screen stand mode which
so it's actually pretty decent in this mode
is it anything more than just moving
a hinge around the hinge
the screen is facing up
let me login a second
let me just show you this
I will talk about ports and such so
I think it feels really good
it it does feel solid
the deck is actually aluminum
that is not fake that is actual brushed blushed
it's blushing brushed aluminum very classy on the other hand
it's huge like look at that bezel on that thing
it's yeah it the bezel is too big it
I'm I'm just overdoing it
let's see if I can sue it
you're really just punking the keys
I really like it I I like just
not a bad keyboard at all doesn't feel bad
I wish I could say that for this right here
this this little guy is it just feels cheap
you can hear the click but it feels shallow
yeah the touchpad is not real good
that said it's responsive it works okay
but this one does not
so this is a mechanical hard drive 5200 rpm
I think it's McAfee Antivirus sorry
I I like totally removed
Best Buy or something is one of the few times
I'm going to tell you
hmm yeah it runs most applications now
I wouldn't be running battlefield on this though
but for most indie games
it stays quite cool even when
well it's actually not too bad
I've just turned my laptop off
there's two on this side
not bad at all really
one it's an so will HDMI port
this is a real honest-to-goodness
how are you really cool
nice addition on the other side
this is the power cable
connector interesting story about the power connector
it is really weird looking and man
I don't think yeah I did bring it
okay this is what the power connector looks like
there's no wrong way to do it
there's a little rocker switch for volume
you don't have to do it in software
I'm trying to remember what they claimed
it has a pretty large hard drive for this range
I think it is great for work light duty home
well thank you very much for watching
operating system it comes with a anal company
and this is a 7-inch capacitive screen tablet
it has got a 1 gigahertz processor and 4000
mAh battery to back it up
so let's start with the unboxing of the fabric
there is a microSD slot here the 3.5
like icing on the enola novo7 need to hold this
these are the multiple home screens sacrifice to Dustin
you can see the interface of the app
pages are shifted going to settings to check the firmware
Wi-Fi there is the connectivity option
the flash storage available is 5.9 3gb
but let's find out how good they actually are
let's take a look at the
they're both entirely made of plastic
the resolution was a little bit higher
it probably also helps out
but we'll get to that in a sec
there's a few basic shooting modes like panorama
HDR and beauty face but nothing too unique
you don't have much to work with
as far as zooming and cropping goes and photos
lack a lot of detail
sharpness and dynamic range is pretty bad
I'm a pretty heavy user when it comes to tablets
these tablets do idle extremely well
losing only between 1 to 2 percent overnight
so it's nice to see
it's a mostly stock version of KitKat
which was very nice to see
there are some lenovo customizations namely the custom launcher
but you can't actually use it for multitasking
get what you pay for anyways
thank you so much for watching this review
Lenovo logo and on the center
in the right corner there is small white
there is darker plastic bar with no functionality
impression is only spoiled by three stickers
there is back camera which is flat
two millimeters screen ratio is around four by three
let's sight is empty and look right there
the tablet have full windows
so you will need Mouse for that
you did a great job
system is running smoothly blazing fast between applications in
this is phenomenal device good job
Lenovo and great job Microsoft
I've got something really exciting
it's the brand-new welcome into his pro small
let's see what we've got here
lightweight well balanced and also
we'll get a little base for it here
if we pop open the base
good thing about this cable couple of things one
it's a nice brushed aluminum with rubber feet
there's no wrong way to plug it in
get it out of the way so right
so it's an ambidextrous tablet one of the other things
they all share the same features
it's light it's portable that means
I can just take it anywhere with me
in fact it's about the size of an iPad
I'm on the go and I'm traveling
another good thing about the tablet
let's hook it up to a computer now
let's go to the computer
which is the interest pro small
we can import our settings from the medium
I'm gonna import that that's awesome
I can't stress that enough people
how do you charge the battery
Express keys the touch here
so we've got our touch options we've got gestures
it doesn't have to just work as an eraser
there's a lot of different things we can do
so this is our screen area here
it's mapped to the tablet
I only have to go here so now
I would recommend remap it to different areas
this corner is the other corner of the space
you could put your keys up here
you could have them down there
we can do different settings on the tablet precision mode
I'm just going in all or other
we can specifically set these for programs so notice
I can do a lot of that from the pen
let me show you on the pen here
notice it's set to double click right
Express keys a touch ring
alright so we can set this to do different things
rotate keystrokes scroll and zoom
okay here we are inside of Photoshop
let's just talk about basic pen pressure right now
this is how we get into our different brushes
I'm putting on the tablet now
we get a thicker stroke so what
I like to use the most is transfer and opacity
I get a darker amount of that
brush okay so that means that when
let me just pinch to expand say
so let me just go to my preferences here
I'm gonna choose my tablet
no matter what settings happen
you know just where it's catching the light
a little bit a little bit on here
this is definitely feels like the pro
I've ever used does that
that's one of the things
you know the ease of use the convenience of this
so it's 250 bucks for this so
income is for computers so it's not
it's Wacom is the correct way of pronouncing net
I'm curious did you guys know that
I'll do them Friday on Saturday as well
I'll see you at the cafe
welcome viewers to a special product review in this video
this is an 8 inch
stay tuned our full review is up next
you have the matrix pad s8 tablet itself
the operating system is Android 9 pack
the box is not rooted
and that's it for system and hardware information
the box is not rooted
Prime video to only show in basic 480p quality
this puts the s8 into the budget
category the s8 has single band
I also attempted an android game and played fairly ok
I featured a bigger model - this version
it's a 10 inch tablet running android 10.
it's got a 1.6 gigahertz octa-core cpu
it has a 20 80 by 800 hd display
we're going to play some games
supplies 5 volts to 2 amps
so here is the tablet itself
i think we have like 22 gigs
this also does have support for 2.4
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz wi-fi which is always nice
this is directly out of the box
86 percent here's the display
it doesn't have any touch gestures
i don't see any lag
now the best we can do is balanced
yeah this is looking pretty good
we are in the settings
let's go to graphics as you can see
that's pretty much what it's going to be
it's pretty smooth like i said before
i'm just not good at playing these
i'm better with the controller
yeah i definitely don't see any lag whatsoever
but i'm here to tell you i did
camera here is capable of doing eight megapixels
the front camera five megapixels
the picture quality is definitely decent
it's nothing to write home about but again
they're not going to be spectacular
especially because this is a budget tablet
i do have some amazon prime video
you can do that on this tablet very easily
just keep in mind that any video
the max resolution is going to be 720
i have some lights on in the background
this tablet is very capable
it can handle some games
we're looking at it dead on right now
another good thing about this tablet
it's still pretty nice and crisp
the sound quality is also really good
it's got those stereo speakers
it's got that metal back
life is also really good on this tablet
you really shouldn't see any lag at all again
keep purchasing products to do reviews
thank you guys for watching
hey everyone welcome back to another review
they had the google pixel slate
optimizing the chrome os software for tablet experience
so i just wanted to check it out
and then the kickstand is made of thin plastic
first impressions of this tablet are extremely positive
i think it feels great
the front is all glass
it weighs a pound or less just under a pound
i mean it feels great to hold
it's nice and thin overall
there is a trackpad again
it's gonna be smaller but it works
it has a nice click on the front of it
the kickstand itself is made of a thin plastic
it's not going to be quite as rigid as that
it is made out of plastic
so it's a little more flimsy
gigahertz has eight cores eight threads
you're looking at bluetooth 4.2
but there's plenty of adapters on the market
that can do that for you
i think 16 by 10 is perfect
they did that moving on to the keyboard
it's not great but it's also not bad either
it's nice to have is another way
it's nice to have the keys
are a little bit cramped
obviously like i said it's a 10.1
uh the one thing about it
it's very nice to have the thing about it
also the kickstand isn't the easiest to pop out again
i want to make you aware of overall
you're gonna be disappointed because number one
it doesn't have the software
chrome os is super lightweight
so just be forewarned in that
look at youtube netflix or anything like that
that's how this thing is built
i think you're going to be very pleasantly surprised
it handles it all very well
you can play games on this device
you can download those from the google
you probably aren't going to be playing
that might be able to play on a pc
everything seems to run efficiently
multitasking seems to work a lot
life has been really good as well now
they claim 10 hours again
in fact i cannot believe you get you know
and you get a keyboard and kickstand in the box
this is a perfect solution in my opinion
make sure you check that out guys
i really appreciate you watching
just wrap the main tablet now ok
I have this back one along with the back
made of pop grey matte grey color
that is nothing the bottom
you can see there is a charging port
and which is good thing
I like it even though
it unlocking is quite fast
let's try to open some page
and it's loading the page quite fast
let's try to load the Google main page
yeah it's loading quite easily without any hiccup okay
the scrolling is a little bit sluggish
but not which will irritate you
try to load the YouTube to load some video
there is not much delay into it so finally
okay yes so that's I think it is
the newspapers or the fonts are readable
this is the perfect tab to check for
thanks for watching my channel when I stay bye
the k77 has a half gig of ram
it shouldn't be an issue
the display does have a narrow viewing angle
simple games play very well in the tablet
onboard storage is limited to eight games
in the back there is also a headphone jack
we're gonna review the trust tablet graphic tablet so
I finally got a graphic tablet
so let's just open it up
okay guys so this is harder than I passed okay
so here's the actual drawing tablet so just oh look
there are the batteries so yeah let's open this up
oh my god this looks so good
oh here's the pad okay
I think this is the connecting cig
okay uh I think this is it
so here's how the tablet feels
the shared drive her pistol
so oh yeah oh no my my cursor is stuck
oh we gotta make it unstuck with a big snap
that happens sometimes so yeah let's
I'll just start with the speed paint
this is the final result at that
this was actually very cool and very careful
they're like actually a lot of people
I've been excited to make this video for a while
it has finally come in the guys over at artist
I get really annoyed of it
I haven't touched the thing yet
so yeah if you're looking into getting the tablet
this was recorded in a professional
Hollywood studio in totally not on my kitchen table
you'll see as we unbox this
I don't know how it felt good
it felt safe in the box the last thing
you also get a 2 button pen
there were a lot of setup issues
I just think it is a combination of Windows
10 being weird with tablets and also the firmware
so it's not even working correctly with the tablet
this fix was really easy
the tablet was working flawlessly
know sort of delays or weird glitches on the screen
it worked exactly as intended
so here's a sculpting time-lapse
I did following grant Abbott's beginner sculpting tutorial
I'm sculpting and I want in deeper indents
I can just push the pen down harder
I have is with the pen
just feel cheap and flimsy now the buttons work
it's just a feeling that
I can't help but notice
I think that's a good price range for it
this thing is still awesome now
but with that being said
presenting a growing little ones video
it's very much like a tablet so
you will be saved yes you will save
welcome back to author video
this video is a tablet review
i will do so for today
this video is brought to you by gaomon again
i've reviewed two of your tablets before pd1161 the s620
i'm going to be reviewing i'll show you the screen
which is this baby right here
it says it is fragile
it was another box but more presentable
your girl actually ripped the plastic off
i guess this also came with a felt case
which kind of surprised me actually okay
i seriously should stop laughing at this
it has a 15.6 inches of work
area 8192 points of pen pressure
i just finished the setup
everything is all set up
so let's get drawing for the speedpaint
i decided to draw darkflower31
so it's something new for me to try out
i'll get into my thoughts about this tablet later
oh all right so my thoughts about this pen display
it's pretty good end of the review
i absolutely love the stand
that comes with this tablet
it's really easy to use
there is a little bit of parallax between the pen
would i recommend this tablet
this is also a fit for intermediate artists and hobbyists
i would go for this tablet immediately
here is the finished drawing of our flower video
i really did have fun drawing her oc
so and that's all for today's review
thank you so much for watching
bring it in today for more updates and my videos
thanks so much for watching
gaomoon for sending this wonderful tablet
i will see you guys in the next video peace
but let's see how it is
i'm probably gonna fail a lot here and it just
i have no idea what i'm doing
uh oh i screwed that up
can somebody help me here
i didn't mean to do that but okay you
hello and welcome back to another video review
fire tablet the 7-inch 50 dollar model
I even pick up at your various locations
Best Buy Amazon and so new style
set me over some cases
obviously easy power out and power off volume
the nice thing about this is that you know
I guess maybe of sorts
and that's the big point about it and very portable
I guess easy to take around with you now
I said there are the cutouts for you
check us over on Facebook
we'll get you next time guys
model number is ma and it's a 8.4
inch tablet so let me go through some good features
I just feel like you got that quality
it has a touch home button here
it has a front camera on the right side
okay so that's why it comes with no case
they meant to take a look
so let's just wait for it
when he loads up he goes
I'm going to placed on
its own and you know say up so
I don't it does have Android 7.1 billion
it has a billion eighty a 63 64 bit processor
so that's another good thing and that screen looks amazing
inch screen you can see here
we've it also has a smart color
3.0 sharpness and hunt enhancement booing
it does have a screen protector
it also has a ridges blue light
in so at nighttime you can look
I has a feel free gig
SD memory card and you know
I mean that's - ok
which is well known everybody
7.1 that's the version and
the camera is really bad
let's try it a uniform
but it's you know the quality isn't the best okay
there was the video camera
that's the best thing about it
okay now in my opinion you know this tablet
it's a 50-50 tablet okay
it has the build quality it has
is that you know it is quite slow the camera
it's not that it's not the best
so thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
I will be talking to you about this
now many of you are more used to seeing
we're talking about woodworking subjects
I write for the UK magazine the woodworker
what is a national magazine like this one of mine
there were a couple of things in the background that
the whole process would have been much easier now
there's a small and a large as well
I'm now going to connect the USB cable I know
let's start with one way
I press very gently and now we'll next up
you turn the pen around
I've just deleted what I've done now
this is the pen one
it says display toggle for multiple displays
I programmed it to be for Photoshop
and you can set these up
I've got Adobe Premiere Elements running in the background
I'm going to say ok now
I want to know the left
it's moving it there right unclick at a time
that's perfect because that means now
let's see if we can get rid of that
now here's an example of something
we try and find myself having to do quite often
I've got a picture of a tool
but the background is rather scruffy
Photoshop is doing a lot of this for me
because it's a clever bit of software
it's coming into effect here and that's wrong nice
that layer whatever it is
you can use the active area of the panel
just like the the trackpad on a notebook computer
Photoshop it might be Premiere Elements it might be AutoCAD
I've really enjoyed having a play with this in choice
5 medium tablet for me
it's a smaller thing altogether and only has 6
thank you very much for watching
Hey guys, I'm the Deal Guy, Matt Granite.
Welcome back to the channel.
It lets me know what type of content to make
So let's go to the unboxing and the test.
All right, let's begin with the unboxing.
You get the charge cable.
You do get an adapter.
And your welcome catalog. All right.
This is a nice wide-screen tablet.
Let's turn this on and set this up.
You can see the screen size.
With that being said, let's do a page load test.
Let's see which one loads faster.
Silk should not be faster.
All right, here we go.
One, two, three. Silk again. All right.
Matts, you can see it's cached.
All right, so the iPad should have an advantage.
Let's try, one, two, three.
Okay, the iPad had an advantage on a cached page.
That's what it's telling you to do.
About a second on the iPad Pro.
For whatever reason, the Fire tablet was faster.
Pro is a little bit
Everything will move unbelievably quickly.
Page scrolls. It's a fluid operating system.
I'm really impressed by this.
And I apologize, it's a little bit windy
Let's actually, let's come over here.
Let's do a really good photo.
All right, here's the photo from the iPad. (camera clicks)
And let's do a photo on the Fire tablet.
You have a, there's like a pullout menu that...
There we go, camera and video.
Let's go to video and we're gonna shoot video now.
I'll do a panning shot, so I'm gonna.
There you go this way.
So this is the Fire tablet panning video.
My daughter calls these toy cars whenever she looks down.
She doesn't realize that they're just cars from a distance.
But again, you're spending over $900 for this.
And now for the drop test.
I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen.
So here we go, one, two, three.
No markings on the case.
Let's go again, I'm trying to get it face down.
And it is cracked. Completely cracked.
And you'll look, the back is almost completely unscathed.
I'll do one, one more slam test.
So what have we learned from this video?
This was a quick break.
My point being, other than that
You're not out all the cash you would spend.
Even to get the screen repair on an iPad
Fire tablet is working beautifully.
Beautiful. Now what is the big takeaway message?
That means Prime Video, Netflix, all of your favorite apps.
Alexa, turn on the studio.
Yes, you can do that with Siri.
But I'm trying to explain that
the functionality tied into this tablet is unbelievable.
that's going to get it all done.
editing, that is 100% not your tablet.
So I hope you did find this interesting.
I really appreciate you watching.
I know your time is valuable.
I know your money is valuable.
here from chicks tech reviews so today

CPU clocked at 1.5 gigahertz

they give it a fail unique
don't expect any great pictures from that camera
either on the top we have the power button
we also have the micro USB charging port
we have a slot for an SD card
gigs that comes with this device
I think the scores are more than appropriate
the maximum resolution is 720p at 60 frames per second
that's basically the maximum resolution of the tablet
run tablet has the version five point
Amazon tablets are mostly aimed at Amazon users
we also don't have a GPS unit inside this tablet
don't forget subscribe and I'll see in the next time
Brad Linder with little beauty
and this is the asus memo pad 7 inch tablet
one advantage is that there's actually a micro
I mean in terms of benchmarks
but you know most uh
it's it's really not bad
I don't have any real complaints for $150 device
we'll take a look from the top
the colors get washed out in difficult to see
and what that means is
it's really not a bad tablet so for $149
you might not really be that disappointed
it looks pretty good from others
it really looks a lot less good
you can find more details at lil defeating calm
hello everyone in this video
he has a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack we've a volume up and down button
it also takes a micro
this has a lot of educational apps
they have to have a password
it has kids say browser as well
so yeah as all has that feature
he has anti blu-ray mhm
but you can also extend that with a micro
SD memory card so the battery life is okay
it's not the best you can see
I automatically goes to the kids zone
hold on let me go back
so that's a kids browser
it helps out the kids a lot as well
alright so these are all the features
he has build quality wise another person
thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
setup was very easy since it is a screenless
which you can see on the screen right now
i'm still not perfect at it
i definitely lack um control with it
i just move closer to the painting
that's my version of zooming in
i just moved closer to the computer screen
for a digital watercolor effect
i think that makes my workflow a lot faster
and then i brush lightly on the highlighted section
there's a wider variety of brushes
there's a smudge tool that also comes in the brush
pack and if it's a watercolor brush pack then
four is very simple and the last one
another thing that i found slightly inconvenient
so i guess you can't have everything
it is an affordable graphic tablet
it's not perfect but it gets the job done
i hope that you liked this video
hopefully it wasn't too confusing or all over the place
i will leave their links in the description box
um yeah if you enjoyed this video
hello there YouTube land this is Tom IAM
and this is review the x58 tablet computer
this is a pretty old tablet
that's been sitting around the office for absolutely forever
and we've only just got a charger for it
you can tuck the buckle underneath
but we ain't gonna do that
we are going to switch it on
we're done eat green early
we like that mini HDMI port
we like that as well
this is a very well specs
our tablet for its age
you don't tend to find many
i think something like that come
yes we can this android market
tends to be a bit weird
it doesn't think anything's compatible with it
and i don't know if the app store you know
I haven't been on any naughty websites
google seems travel just dressing
they're quite remember that does think it's for shortcuts
yes yes as you can see this
resistive touchscreen tablet has multitouch
Cupid responsiveness isn't the best
that hasn't got a about site version
I don't actually have the full specs for this
just a reference i think
it's around the 600 megahertz processor
that's none of these sorts of things
so that's that now let's try
pre-loaded it's it's been a while since
sound all of sound but look
some reason my hand is bright white as well
they look lots and lots of white
there's the catapult thing there it's launched a bird
isn't it only white right
YouTube works great for work
i believe about 80 pounds
its ears is quite heavy
the belt is absolutely lovely
you can't press on the screen and make it dip
this device do not support watch proof function bad times
I was hoping for some waterproof function
there you go if you want to buy this
because that's what they do
I've install me I'm having a bit
I've got a package here it says I belong it
though it's addressed to me
this is kind of a product review of sorts
you all right there we go whoo
Yan Liu Yan that Chinese symbol
they actually advertised the damn thing as a
I can already tell you as I always
oh my Jesus you can press this
yes this pen is like the best tablet pen
I have ever held in my in my hands
they are definitely made because
I always when I hold my pen
is this tip of the pen
they are all the same kind
yep this is like half the size of what
you're not going to play with this whole thing
way better than with any other tablet
I have I have heft
I have had sorry and I've had like four different
this is my fifth fifth temple
that was very nice of them again
I'm not being paid to do this
definitely in just that it says also on it
you mean you know you know
it's going to be geared to wash it towards it
I assume you're going to draw your
I mean you could switch it
you want the right size
but that's just a personal thing
I have lots of cords and wires
I actually forgot to mention something about the pin
so yeah just a heads up
yeah you after playing with this for about a week
also the size of the tablet
the size is actually pretty nice
the amount of time that
I've been playing with this
so it's not really a problem
then by all means go buy this tablet
I guess but twenty dollars
it's like it's it's good
it's a very good tablet for beginners
centric tablet launched by meters and
this is a very different product from any other
Android tablet you see in the market
there is a special software
we hope you liked this video
hey guys today i just got me a new tablet
what i have here is a juno canvas
20 drawing display tablet pen which is 19 inches
and i'm going to show you guys
the tablet did come with a pin holder
well basically picture because once you get it
this tablet really feels a lot different
before the live you start
I'm sorry to unload this video late
thank you the tablet that
I'm going to leave you is Pablo a 640
it's a small tablet only 6 inches
insured it's cheap and like tablet
I was hoping this tablet doesn't do that anyway
let's move on to what this tablet contains first
the pen design is created
because never seen a table pen like this
I don't know why they made like this
maybe to reduce weight of the pan
the name of the table is long and thick
while you're aiming really hard otherwise it's okay now
let's see how it works
first of all to use this tablet
you need a tablet driver
hi guys this is raju rahman from techtonic dragon
touch a company to be honest
i've not really heard of before
one of their aims is to produce affordable electronics
i tested it out for a few weeks
it's well designed nothing over the top nice and simple
it's a little worrying when you have to point out
there's plastic on top of the screen with some instructions
have a read of that if you want
i know how to turn the tablet on so off
tempted me to rip it off completely
let's see what else is in the box
you've got a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the volume rocker
power button and reset here
you have the cover for the micro sd card slot
what seems like both sim card slots
you can see the dragon touch branding
and what seems like dual speakers around the bottom
the back of the tablet is actually made of metal
it's called to the touch
i thought the whole thing would be plastic
so that's a pleasant surprise
i'm glad i didn't remove the factory
installed screen protector as you can see the screen
it doesn't feel too heavy
when you're holding this tablet you can tell
it's still better than what i expected
b g n and ac no wi-fi 6 here
but what did you expect
also one thing that dragon touch likes to point out
that's certainly a good thing
it's good enough for consuming content on netflix and youtube
it may not be super crisp or sharp
but it's hard to complain for too long
that's a little odd is the display refresh rate
the tablet is running on android 9.0
so that's a good thing
all that means is the software
doesn't slow down the tablet
but you'll definitely notice some choppiness
it plays smoothly without any issues
multitasking isn't something you'd expect to work
and the chrome browser side by side here
it does a pretty good job
even from a tablet perspective
low light shots are bad
they're very dark and lack detail
pictures taken outside during the day are kind of okay
they're not too bad compared to the pictures
i took with the galaxy tab s5v
certain things are overexposed but to be honest
i'm being a bit too hard with the k10
look it costs 100 quid
no one really cares about the cameras on a tablet
let's not be around the bush
it's pretty bad the max volume isn't loud at all
you get a max db of 19.8
and i could have tolerated that
have the quality of the sound being better
the k10 had six percent of battery life left
do i recommend this tablet
why even watching this video
basically you can do all the things
most people do on a tablet yes
you know during my initial use of the k10
everything you need it to do
then yes i do highly recommend this tablet
this has been raju rahman from techtonic
and don't forget to check out these other videos too
welcome to my review of the view
max s7000 one tablet price-wise
there is also no instruction manual
it has an amazing airplane graphic
it smells like it came from China
holy said that a car
just drive through the background
1.2 gigahertz you've got to be bullshitting me
you cheap live look dumb 1.5 goddamn gigahertz
that blob core video processor
they did a phenomenally shitty job of answering emails
so well how's it going
i'm going to be talking about graphics tablets
do you really need them as a photographer
let's break into this massive debate
answer this it's just personal preference
what works for you may not work for someone else
my tree backgrounds studied music
self-taught and graphic design self-taught photography
uh what i can tell
you is from an audio standpoint
so i've been using a trackball mouse since 2004.
when i was studying music in college
i use trackball modes even into graphic design
i was the only one in my team
ever to use a trackball mouse
i've a lump on my wrist here
it's a collagen buildup in my tendons
that's that's my main hand for drummond and everton
the trackball makes quite easy
let's get into what we're actually here to talk about
it looks basically like a wacom pen
uh even down to the fact that it's battery free
it does not need any batteries
you don't need to charge
you have to worry about any of that
which is the pressure sensitivity
i use none of that
i don't care for the pressure sensitivity
i forgot to use the customizer buttons
went back to using the keyboard
and um yeah i just
i buy a graphics tablet literally for the accuracy
you want to be accurate
it's just such an easy way to work
it's accurate and that's why i bought a graphics habit
yet we settle for substandard mouse
almost i don't i don't decide that
oh no i've got the i've got the pen
i'm only going to use the pen like i know
i didn't like it at all
how i edit my photos
you can do this kind of editing in lightroom
um i don't really over like doing it
i will do all my dodging and burning in photoshop
it's as intense as an artist
you shouldn't be settling for just a mouse
it's not an entry-level graphics tablet
i think it's up there on par with wacom
it's just an affordable option
this is my second one
i've owned this literally is my own personal one
these are my personal thoughts on this
i'm extremely impressed and happy with the company
i hope you enjoyed this
i would highly recommend the xp pen deco pro small
its time to get used to it
hola good morning and welcome
yeah little off camera secret
their daddy just did a slight burn before game
there's only one barb though
oh you think it was two perps well there
and it's still dark isn't it
is it for the lights
who puts the lights on in your room
you're gonna shading now aren't you
yeah because you were saying to
you're very good eating gypsies
you buy an app and and the
Bob's took one for Christmas
sure can pupster do your worst
Marshall can you press chases Chuck
Rocky's recycling thing on it
I was rocking on it
oh he is there oh nice
oh oh she knows bill snug bill
yes my favorite part is sloppy ruble
yeah chase is my lowest
he's having a midlife crisis and decided to start jogging
I was gonna go to London
which means it's time to say goodbye
thank you good bye open
fatherhood he's been there bye-bye
as far as the other two 7-inch tablets
one has a resistive screen
it has a capacitive screen
that's multi-touch it's got 5-point capacitive touch
Kobe tablets so as far as Hardware
actually we've got mini HDMI port
there's a microphone right there headphone jack
so we've got this little button right here this
I thought it was a home button
but it's actually a back button and like
I said that got a little camera up here
the quality is not very good
it's a point three megapixel
it's supposed to be for video chatting whatnot the camera
it doesn't take very good pictures
they're pretty much black and white
almost you can adjust it but the camera
they smooth even with a live wallpaper on here
the app drawer loads pretty smoothly
it is a pretty good processor
I've tested it's pretty decent
it's one of his strengths
I went ahead and download a couple other app stores
because the amazon app store
they have a lot of apps
you can get like netflix through here
you can also get like your daily free paid app
I got it like I got YouTube through there
I did here with Google Maps
I said Netflix does work so Netflix runs
well one thing with the mini
so that's kind of annoying
it's not going to show up on here at all
it's got the 800 by 480 resolution screen
which is pretty typical for budget tablets
I really don't care for it that much
the biggest problem with this tablet is the battery life
life had probably gone down 15% since
I've been doing this review
that is the failing with this tablet
it's not a bad budget tablet
check out the e-book reader com
so thank you for watching
we're kind enough to send me another tablet this time
it's the deco mini seven
look it's like a really nice box
i think is to celebrate their 15th anniversary
but yeah like so first impressions
i don't that means nothing to me
which is that's quite a lot
i like that i think
this pen is really nice
yeah i like this pen
i have no complaints cable
that's good this little thing
somebody on the other unboxing video
i did commented saying it's to help remove nibs
so that's i guess that's all that is awesome
i don't see like the quick start guide
let's i'll read it later but okay
i used to use like a while ago
so that's quite like yeah
i think that's a workable size and for me
i prefer smaller tablets anyway
don't want your tablet sliding around
yeah i mean first impressions
i'm happy with all little things
that's how easy it is and it'll do it
it literally takes a few minutes to do
um the default settings were fine
the sensitivity is so easy to adjust
it's you know it's not a problem so please
oh my god it fits perfectly i was yeah
i think it'd be quite good for that as well
um the pen is very responsive pressure wise
i'd use the larger tablets
there's nothing to put it in like
which if you're a beginner artist that would be great
you don't know how you're going to get along with
low-cost tablet that didn't take up too much space
just in case something happened to my ipad
i think it's worth that price genuinely
any feedback is always appreciated
and thank you so much for watching
i hope this video is useful for anyone
i hope you have an amazing day
so yes thank you bye
this tablet was ready to go plug it in
download the drivers from the website
delete the old tablet drivers then restart the PC
I pulled up paint tool
wait and while at first this is annoyance
that's just how much more potential for line control
the drivers would have issues with paint tool
no more uninstalling paint tool
the tablet came with a paper disc
telling you how to get the drivers from the website
I find myself rubbing my arm against the buttons
the only difference between the two would be that the
making good for use on your regular-sized desks
the tablet works with all the artwork programs
I do have the give him some good pointers
the pen itself feels light
I really don't like that
this helps a lot with wire management and
I recommend the vaycay 30 drawing tablet
some people have apprehensions about battery less pens which being
I've only ever had these two specific models of tablet
this is the 10.1 inch version
you also get three months of
Vudu free but I'm interested in the tablet itself
it's definitely got some heft to it
CPU on the front here
it's got all your instructions you need
we also get our user manual
it looks like they have their proprietary keyboard dock connector
I'm not sure if they're selling this yet
it's looking a lot better than the 2019
non pro versions for the cpu
so it is built into this version of Android 10
they're usually shipping with two gigs
I think it's a pretty decent screen
both of them are really bad
so we do have a significantly more powerful
1080p 60fps video is no issue whatsoever
well let's go ahead and test out
Disney Plus now keep in mind
you're not gonna get any 4k content on this
Disney Plus loads right up
you can download this directly from the Google Play Store
just to give you a look
so first up we have Minecraft Pocket Edition
I'm set to 8 chunks
have a bunch of stutters
but this one here seems pretty smooth here
King of Fighters all-star and performance here isn't great
Pub G is really well optimized
we're at the lowest settings with the lowest frame rate
let's move up to a harder one like
Dead or Alive - and see how it performs
let's take a look at some
this is a really easy one to run
2019 has more power than this
Amazon fire OS which is something
Plus and Netflix ready to go
but that's it for this one
I was hoping for some better emulation performance
I still remember when Isaac eat
let's try this one thin and lighted this graphics
they will not provide you any driver
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I'll see you guys next time till then good bye
so that's what we're going to do today
i'll show you how that works
it supports tilt on the stylus
the tablet is less than a centimeter tall height
this is not a standalone tablet
let's start with an unboxing
bring it along with your laptop and draw from anywhere
the stylus is battery free
is the familiar cylinder which contains the stylus
you also get this pretty cool pen
that actually feels really nice to ride with
you'll find eight additional pin laps unscrew the other cap
and you'll find this stylus
it has only one level as i mentioned earlier
that you should remove first
the cables are designed as a 3 in 1 solution
that's the only cable going into the tablet
i recommend you restart your computer before doing anything else
i like to have a shortcut for flipping my canvas
a color picker brush eraser
react to me using the dial
this was one of the tests
i've had and that's free now
let's check out how much parallaxing we can detect for
it wasn't really necessary at all
it might be a bit different
that this video is in
my general impression of the screens quality was really good
i didn't really think about it anymore
they continue to use these diaries
the innovator 16 is by the time
i know a lot of other tablets out there
i think i have concluded what i wanted to conclude
this is my new main tablet for the time being
i'm really happy about it
i hope you enjoyed it
dad doesn't today we are looking at the nah
here's the cool thing about it
$79 they pack a whole lot into this
it's a 7 inch tablet it's running Android 6.0
we're going to jump in look at some of that
they'll do that so you know key thing
you've earned stars and this keeps growing so
love this that you know
lessons grows with you quizzes
also we want to show you some other things
this dream pro studio so they can draw anime
publish all this stuff in there
apps educational experiences loaded onto it so again
I'm we're gonna show you in a bit you can
you can go to the normal
you've got the camera the gallery you know
English math social studies have all of that there
we're going to call up
let's do the chore list
but what you can do
what they're doing is actually can then earn
Noby points and you can do different things
get some toy or something like that
so that's a neat aspect of it
so that's a cool idea
have all been curated specifically for kids and you can
they want here again with those knobby coins
that's good - let's say kind of in a pinch
SC you can just unlock it
um overall do also want to say this
well the things which we really like about
is that right out of the box
I can have this set
so rather than kids constantly asking you can
I use the tablet can I use it
it'll just be locked out
unlock it and earn extra time
I think parents going to like that
they've been doing a lot of this
it's nice to be able to hand them
do you know this animator drawing all of that
all right this video won't be like the others
well that's because i have um well wait
i have this xp pen
it has the specifications on the back
i tried to take it off to keep it
the startup guide extra nibs
it's really cool to have the pen
i think it looks good
i'm not sure about um the little bump thing
it just feels kind of weird
uh you're gonna use that with your phone
i don't really need that
uh what i needed to do
um the pressure levels work great
i'm not used to that
i have been drawing for years on a screen tablet
um it works on abyss paint sketchbook and medibang
i tried doing a little bit of speed paint
okay while this speed paint is going on
you can do that or just
use it as a mouse personally
it's not expensive at all
you can use this as an artist or a photographer
i even tried to use it on osu
i tried it on multiple drawing abs
i tried it on photoshop
adobe animate i tried it on rafael paga and medibang
i'm just gonna keep it simple so one
it is a great tablet for a beginner artist
two great price and great quality
yeah and i think that is about it
that's my whole review on this deco mini 7 tablet
hey guys how's it going daniel here today
i'm actually really excited for this thing
this has a 1024 by 600 resolution
this guy also has two cameras
let's talk hardware of course for 50
so we have the lock button
we have the micro usb we have the mic
a good thing about that is
that amazon has definitely improved the software
now you can download things like netflix
it opens up as it should and at no point
and i think that's very important
i left this on my desk
this is a really good starter tablet
fire with that said this is also great for kids
this is a great tablet
this has a ton of things
they kind of look cool from time to time
that's pretty much it for this video
it was just kind of to show you
thank you guys for watching this video
and i'll catch you guys in the next one goodbye
we're gonna be taking a look at the all-new 2019
Amazon's ninth generation 7-inch tablet
Amazon fire tablets inside of the box
we have our basic black plum sage which
I have here an Twilight blue
that's it for this one
did bump the specs up a little bit
unfortunately they didn't add any more
this is the same CPU that's in the Amazon fire
eight and so mediatek mt6752 one gigabyte of ddr4
8 version this is a 1024 by 600
IPS display and the viewing angles are amazing
I don't think it's taking full advantage of it
4.1 in the operating system is fire
I personally haven't had enough time to test this out
let's go ahead and see how this thing performs
same thing with 3d mark here
I was only able to run ice storm
now it's time to move over to some native
Android gaming unfortunately pub G would not run on here
this is actually the first time
I also tried the lite version
but it wouldn't even start up so the first game
I'm gonna test here is minecraft
crap is definitely playable on the new 2019
we'll move over to YouTube now
now if you want to install
mario 64 as you see here
we're getting a constant 30
we'll try one more here this is
Tekken 3 again really great performance pretty much
Atari 2600 up to ps1 including some n64 games
expect this to go down on
I will leave a link in the description
I created on the fire 8
I would just stay away from this
if you have any questions
let me know in the comments below
if you could hit that like button
maybe subscribe to the channel but like always
we are trying to buy this new tablet from wailmer
it's a $28 starter tablet
which is a really good price
ok it's a blue navy
see okay but this one has a common one
they use the one day
it's about 16 different languages
you can set two seconds ten seconds and picture size
this is a video relatives
I like that there you go
that's the video and selfie
camera is the same with rear-facing camera 0.3
so we can expect the same as well
same quality picture quality as well
these are the contents of the box
we have this pen which is good for your grip
and it's not that firm nor is it too bouncy
so that's cool over here
we have spare pen nibs for this
is the main boy over here
thank you card along with the instruction manuals
this is what it looks like
and that's all i have to say
this is Lisa for mobile tech review
let's take a look at the device
it's an attractive looking product
here is actually speaker on each side for stereo
you have a front-facing video camera here for her video
that's all gone here for
Froyo but you do get the big widgets here
the launcher is it's fairly handy over here
this is your most recently used applications
and you've got the weather embedded over here
you can either plug in a location you use your
you got the music player over here
here in case you might have both
and when you're on this screen you can also switch
what's not so good about this
is the 800 by 480 pixel display
that's the same resolution as a high-end smartphone
the text is really not sharp
you can see some pixelation and photos
it's something like a tablet
GT which runs pretty nicely
actually this is pretty good for gaming
so that's the live TV app
I get to hear the speakers do performance again
the game is pretty good also web browsing with
the web browser here again is 800 by 480 resolution
they're serving from their front page
it doesn't bog down the device to a flash 10.1
can on some slower CPU to Android devices
this is Lisa from mobile tech review

so that's all the features
thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
ladies and gentlemen welcome back
this is a full-on 10-inch tablet that runs android
has a little bit of weight to it
what's powering the split display
which is the battery itself
the standby time is up to 15 days
but not least it does have a camera
you have a five megapixel front-facing camera you know
um i don't know about selfies
those aren't as big right now
but zoom calls and all that absolutely massive
thank you guys for watching
this is going to be me logging off
this is a $99 tablet from
it's a thousand twenty four by six hundred capacitive
multi-touch display a quad-core processor it runs Android 4.4.2 kitkat
a second as a rechargeable
lithium-ion polymer battery of around 8 hours battery life
you have a micro SD card slot
now let's look at the screen
this has an edge lit screen unfortunately with edgelet screens
it's a lot lighter in this tablet
you can go down to smart colors
make sure the smart color is on in this mode
it does greatly improve the screen on this thing
they don't have any way of updating
unless you go through their site
it's just the basic tablet
it's pretty much filled with everything
I didn't have it set up
we're connected to that now
I have a little bit of lag
there let's go back into it
I really like it there
we go not quite used to this
the speakers on the back so it sounds tinny
this tablet has bluetooth and it's Bluetooth 4.0
it was more or less a mirror
it's it's much heavier and it does have a good
you know rubber rubberized filling on the back
but it's still you know it's still very heavy
the screen really takes away from that
that's my review of the polaroid p10 10.1 internet tablet
please subscribe rate and check back
ETA prime back here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at the all-new
Venky oh matrix pad s30
this is a new tablet to hit the market
the price point on this is 150
they're trying to hide something or two
it's just not a well known
the packaging is pretty plain
I know it's a 10.1
we have a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
we have our volume rocker
it actually looks really good
IPS display but I get
now it will depend on what you're doing
it's got a 13 megapixel rear camera
8 megapixel front and it's running
Android 9.0 with the 2019 October patch
it's not the newest we could get
so if we just start up the app
right hand corner you can see
Hulu and these and Plex
we do have those dual stereo speakers
I just posted the scores
remember this is a 50
if you're just looking to play call of duty mobile
but that's pretty much it for this video guys
I really appreciate you watching
this video is being sponsored by pulse
comm they are a great service
that can fix your mobile device anywhere you are
you can go on their website to book an appointment
there's no windows or anything here
you get a set appointment
in many instances they can come out the same day
and if you use my coupon code
this one really feels cheap to me
the backing here is a very lightweight
plastic not very high quality
you're kind of buying at your own risk
and it's already picking up dirt and grease again
Lenovo so buy at your own risk here
it isn't bad for the price point
this one is very cold and that it's very blue
it does have an mtk
so it's relatively up to date on that front
so not all that heavy here
you can see what it looks like from the side
you have a headphone jack
the speaker is in the back here
not so ok with the build quality
we did see a little better performance out of that
it's running pretty nicely on this one as well so
there's a 5 megapixel camera here on the back
I think you can do better for the money
why 88x tablet for kids
so here's the tablet itself
they also while they sell this in multiple color
so here's the silicon case which
the second is actually a very nice case
that doesn't come with a case so first impressions
I thought the tablet was I
I think it feels pretty good in the hand
it's got a nice form factor
USB port also a separate power
you can't charge it through their on/off button headphone jack
volume and also a micro
the screen on the front
well sorry for the end
I think they did a nice job
overall it's got a good feel to it
the corners are a little flexible though
I mean it looks cute for kids
that's the microphone right there
and you have the micro
I think they did a nice job
I think is a cute case again
it's still a pretty reflective screen
once you get it turned on
it turns off fairly quickly
this is really not very good to be honest
it's taken me to make this video
so let me pull it up
it says it seems for
it has some flash games
it has a art program
it's a very simplistic art program
but that's pretty much the gist of what this does
I mentioned they have favorites
Berthier and yes I I was not born in 2000
I tried rebooting doesn't work
your own games as a regular tablet
it's it's not bad like
I already showed the screen to you
it looks pretty good so there are views
it's just it's off access
I think it's a good one for kids
but it's going to cost you a lot less
you probably gonna want to load your own and yeah
I have thank you very much for watching
what is going on guys
we'll be doing just that so personally
they come packaged in this
so let's talk about some specs
the tablet will not function on
if not you can always get an adapter
you know it certainly feels like it's gonna last
plate is made of brushed aluminium
I was also really impressed with the stand
click and the other one as the ctrl
it's just generally more pleasant to work with
you would find on your phone
these will not respond to touch
they will only respond to the pen
let's take a look at these pen nibs
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
today we're going to look at the latest
we're going to look at it now so here
you want a sharp picture too
don't you this is the 7 inch model
a lot of improvements under the hood
they have improved it you know
UI it's also a lot faster
they've done a lot of changes to both
you're showing me stuff on the cloud as ever
Amazon has plenty of cloud services
none that doesn't just mean like you
Amazon has done a wonderful job here
it's not going to be flat against the table
I don't have to do that
we take a look at the back some more here
soft touch finish not immune to fingerprints does get greasy
Amazon's usual a unique unique sense of style
here it's kind of interesting
we have our volume controls right there
so when you're holding it there's a little
Ridge you can feel it now
I have to say these
you can really feel them however
it's a little weird because this has an up
Evan you plug in the cable
it's going to stick at an angle
we have our three point five millimeter combo audio jack
you can see if I move it around
sound keyboards you can choose from different languages here
we'll take a look at that
we do have parental controls here
reading books are using certain applications
Amazon goes for kind of wider
there is a whole lot
that's different to this runs obviously full
Android over here very vanilla
that battery is sealed inside here
no removable door to access that battery
Amazon Prime videos reading magazines reading books
it's pretty cool this time usually
Amazon goes with something like I you know
means you can play some nice games on this
Wi-Fi only is going to cost
there is no expansion slot on this device
that's the with offers price
I was pushing a movie right now
Play applications that you've paid for it
but you can see that
I've side loaded all of those
and how do you do that
it's not not too hard at all
just turn that on so you can sign load programs
I use andro file explorer use a USB cable
Gmail did not come on here either
it does actually work so fun to have alternatives
you can go ahead and read
downloading magazines are actually a lot bigger than ebooks
so that's going to take a little
I also have a Kindle paperwhite
sharp text the super-high resolution IPS
nice speeds beautiful looking screen
there lit up right now because
you'll get the same experience that you do on
take a little nitro drive a little dirty
yeah they know about a shortcut
it's playing absolutely beautifully visual effects on the screen
the whole nine yards looking great
some reading magazines doing some web browsing probably
you're going to enjoy the 8.9 inch more probably
and who is this device for
you ready to go the next episode
you know that they've never made an application for that
obviously this wouldn't be the product for you again
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
good people of the earth
Shaun's Nelson here from fantastic anatomy and in today's video
this pen is exactly the same
I'm not trying to draw lightly or anything like that
I don't know I assume that's from more poor construction
there used to be two buttons here
this is the one thing that has quote-unquote broken air
these things is a little plastic piece that broke off
I never really used it that much
this thing is made of some like futuristic super material
you know like put this here
this is a really solid piece of equipment
I don't really use them too much
look how long this cable is
it's good casing it never
it's fine you could have it on your lap
the computer in front of you aways it's fine
I've never had a problem with that
looks like a very sturdy construction
I'm showing you this is how I use it
I didn't clean it up or anything
this is just how it is
my friends bamboo first off
the construction felt super flimsy
bamboo has these big buttons
I can't imagine that could never really happen with this
I don't know I went
it's kind of ridiculously strong
I don't know if I already mentioned this
but the pen of the bamboo did not feel
is this in 203 and this size
if you like it you might like it bigger
you might like it smaller
some people like it smaller
I hope that was helpful
let me know in the comments down below and peace
god bless and stay fantastic everyone
it has a ten inch 1080p
it has a 1.6 gigahertz octa-core CPU
5.0 it has a 5 gigahertz
did you review you guys
storage here is the tablet
so here is the tablet itself
I can tell you it has some really good weight
it doesn't feel like it's cheap
so here is the tablet itself
it's got a nice metal backing on it like
there are our dual stereo speakers
one over here one over here
I said before it does have some weight to it
it's got a nice cool
it's really not bad at all
the sound quality is pretty good too
you know right in front of you
see the tablet in brighter environments
It Yourself depending on your situation
the tablet also isn't super thick
it's really not that much thicker
I want to buy the tablet
it's not super thick and it's not super thin
we make out what that says
the pixels are super small
we are on a web page
I haven't had any problems
viewing what's on the screen
and it's definitely quick enough for pretty much
everything's running pretty smoothly as you can see
there is just a little bit of lag
the video is definitely pretty sharp
it's got some good colors
it never once got warm
it was always cool to the touch
the battery lasts quite some time
it's got a good picture
I put out into videos
thank you guys for watching
Bowman from Bowman GT channel
they back up a little bit unfortunately
nobody wants to see that anyhow
this particular one is made by Phoenix
I think Phoenix automotive and so far
I got so you're pretty much on your own
you have to go to their site
watch what those guys do
HVAC unit here and your switches
of course up here okay and it works out fine
everything works just like it's supposed to that way
you know an interesting thing is it
uses a lot of the old parts
I don't know what's gone with this thing
I don't know what that is
let's go through the features here
Play Store which is pretty cool for this particular unit
I'm not one thing I haven't figured out yet is
okay that's one gripe responsive pretty good
it has lots of abilities as far as cameras
go you can add in your cameras
I have the automatic HVAC
video is the same story as the music pretty much
it looks for local files and it'll play them
it doesn't activate that unless it's in
the screen actually looks better than the stock screen
those can bus information is static
I can't figure out how to change it yet
fault ones which is not many of et cetera etc
but again not all out there like another double feature
you have if you have factory now
that didn't make any sense
I think I have to go see
scroll through the things i koruba now
this doesn't work but I don't know if I won
wait for it by the way
there's a lot of over screens that happen in this
sometimes it'll tell you the doors open
I haven't figured that one out yet
don't consult any gun to console
that's from the internet from the tablet
doesn't seem to come through
so what do you do you know
cool but most tutoring satellite was it
anyway guys you're getting the idea
I don't know I really divided on it
what do you guys think you know
tell me your comments below
what do you think this thing is worth
I mean would you use it
would you like one for your truck
I got to hear from you guys cuz really
it looks neat but functionality-wise
hey guys are you doing top here here
like you're also tablet not also tablet but tablets
were also your impression of it
I thought was going to be very promising
is this big huge dent
here you might be wondering like whoa
that's how the product that came
but they could have maybe
um so that's that uh the tablet product itself
the significance signature like tablet area
whatever that is we call it the indication
Xbox and logo nothing really like sasquatch
it's like the tablet itself
you have no idea how much I love these
I'm going to get to that later
I'm not sure if you can see it here
I'm going to show you later
the co is kind of blue but
I'm actually holding on to a pen
not some kind of like weird ass dick that
that's what that was like the difference
that has like a bunch of thank-you messages to you
the graphic ten tablet manual
which really just you know
we probably won't need if you know what
I read what you're doing quick guide
I tried many different settings on Windows
it won't make much difference
probably how did you get to start with the work
I went to their website
I don't exactly know what I'm supposed to call it
it has the sticker sight
so you peel it all because of sticker
okay so that's basically all
oh one more thing he also gave you
it's probably ambidextrous although the logo is on BIA
on the top at the pump the other side
that's called via dorsal side for economical terms
thanks anatomy captain or med school
so wears like this and the reason
I was looking forward to this
the reason being is that
you have your hand kind of like you
I just couldn't like control my aim
precise like momentum heavy stuff like also gameplay
that was the overall breakdown of the tablet and before
like review of this entire product as to what
I don't understand what they did here is
I know I do understand what I did here
they put for a fee
my desk is kind of very slippery
I've complained multiple times to many different companies
it feels like the pen not like a stick
the holder is a touch in the receivers
there it's very low profile which you know
I don't think I'd be reusing this
the charging cables are in all here
extension cables a nice addition glove

you just pop your speed part into there so
my daughter dropped it quite a few times
it'll need to be like this but it's you know
there are a couple of areas where
I'm a couple of other things
um the only other thing really would be that
the camera on the device is not amazing but again
it's not really a huge drawback
I really hope you found this short video helpful

that you know helps to protect them kids
okay but it's very slow to operate this

Wi-Fi so we can actually connect to the internet
I wouldn't say is excellent okay
I wouldn't really recommend this tablet
there's not much to say about this
okay is slow you know
it's a slow tablet charge
don't even that stands out of the whole
you know tablet everything is the casing okay
it's a very useless tablet

inch ips screen 8192 pressure levels and a 1080p resolution
this year was to try race shadow
legends raid's a tough game

he's absolutely awesome in clan boss
only and it's that easy
just click the link in the description

it's not that big of a deal
and that's always good to have
the process was the same
it's the easiest way to get in touch with us
presented to cj joy before fasting 100.
sorry guys let me fix that real quick
well let's get into the video
thank god i don't have a pimple anymore
not like in the other vlog
you can see that i have a temple
yeah this is pretty different from my usual content
i'm filming this because something just came
i'm still in shock right now
this actually came two days ago
which is why i'm vlogging right now
in the last vlog we went to the restaurant
yes say hi brother okay
this is our living room by the way
this house is actually older than my dad
we live in a simple life
we stopped by at the restaurant
because we are actually gonna get something
i'm gonna go down in a while
i actually stopped by the restaurant
oh the waiters here are really fun
okay so my cousins are actually outside
they are actually looking for me
okay um let's see how this goes

ask that to mr beast not me man
let's go thank you ebay and amazon
good thing you make animations not unboxing videos exactly
i'm rick there's rick hey should i read this aloud
i don't know how to read
susan was watching youtube watch
oh my god okay 100.
you all see you in the next video right you
hey what's going on guys
welcome back to the channel
hold the screen right here
so let's say you're getting a youtube notification
maybe you want to silence that
just swipe to the right right here
then you're going to see a little gear icon
it's going to silence the notification
another thing i did notice
that's how you would actually create your folders now
another thing you can do on
that looks blue with a person's head in it
just go ahead hit that
clean this way to be completely honest with you
so what i did was downloaded
now another thing i like going here
is these the this gestures option
it says checking for update
stability it's in about 204 megabytes for the download
another thing that's cool is multitasking
hold the youtube with your finger
you're going to get split screen
it's going to access the split screen window
let's go ahead and hit chrome so you you can
let's say you have two windows open
just pay the extra for 50
it is apps down below
what you're going to do is locate wallpapers app
then once you do that you have enabled daily wallpapers
another thing that this device does have is dolby
it has this option that says music
you can lock the device and things of that nature
you could just hit it right here
it's going to be password protected
so if it's light outside it will get brighter
is the indicator light for notifications
so let's see right here
it's saying right here but you get to you
get this toggle where you can move it around
this device also does have screen cast right here
um screen assistant is pretty cool right here
blue light filter for your eyes or change
usually in the middle of the night is best fit
you could do it around you know like three
you could always power it back up
is this option inside of the battery settings
location always turned on so that way
my name is alex and welcome back in today's video
we have an octa-core cpu
friendly tablet for a super quick unboxing
you're obviously gonna find the tablet itself
we have a little user manual
we have the usbc charging cable and the power adapter
so that's about it for the box
well that's not the case with this one
you almost get that ipad
unfortunately they're both at the bottom
we have a 3.5 mil audio jack
that has a 1080p resolution
the screen does look really good
it charging the tablet to the charger
the tablet does great for social media apps
the maximum resolution of course is 1080p for any videos
i mean you're recording in 480p
so should you buy a tablet like this
well i mean for the price
you're getting one of the best screens on any tablets
hopefully you enjoyed this video if you did like it
don't forget to press that like button
that's new in the box and then
Christmas is coming one of these
I'm giving away in two contests and the other one
it ended up being used around our house so anyway
so hopefully you can read this
these are the basic specs of the unit
TFT capacitive touch and sorry capacitive touchscreen
this is this will get pulled out
it doesn't have a lot of power
I'm playing there what can I tell you
I mean it's a it's an Android tablet
there's nothing wrong with them
is that for the price
I think they're great so I'm gonna give the proscan
- A few months ago, I reviewed my first color
eReader called the PocketBook Color.
Unfortunately for me, you folks are a vocal audience.
eReader from a company called Onyx International.
Obligatory shout out to the old YotaPhone, rip.
That E-Paper screen has a name, Kaleido Plus.
Seeing it after sunset depends on an integrated front light
that gets the job done
Watching Lisa from Mobile Tech review cover the company's Note
that model's thin metallic construction and stylish orange piping.
anchoring the display, there's nothing remarkable about it.
At its slowest it's your typically E reader
the screen is a hot rod.
It's almost fast enough to watch a quick video.
I do on my phone
but on this high contrast, highly power efficient display.
But let's be real, right?
And here the Nova 3 Color delivers.
when used with the stylist that comes in the box.
And the software overall is responsive and very customizable.
You can navigate using Samsung style
In other oversights, there's no accelerometer onboard.
you have to use this needlessly complex ribbon of hieroglyphics.
It all adds up to a device
But you know that's not the only competition.

Until next time, thanks for watching
android tablets are in this really weird place right now
amazon continues to push out their fire
it's a 7 inch tablet
that only costs 50 dollars
yes fifty dollars but is it worth it
tablet comes with a mediatek 8163 processor
gigahertz cpu with one gig of ram to say
this tablet is slow is an understatement
it is beyond slow apps
take forever to open up
so what can you expect
it's an all plastic tablet with a really basic design
uh and at least it has a headphone jack
they cut back to save money
it's just not very bright
it's a horrible sounding speaker
i guess um but it just sounds really muffled
well it has a camera
the cameras are also horrible
you won't even find google play services on this tablet
you won't get the official youtube application
but that might be more work than it's actually worth
applications are here like netflix
hulu disney plus is also on the amazon app store
the issue is uh storage
so that's actually really good
and because it's running fire os
it's kind of a cluttered and complicated mess
there's really no satisfying way of navigating
they kind of throw all of that at you
and you're kind of stuck with it
so that's actually a really useful feature
this tablet comes with most android tablets
so that's something that this tablet has over the ipad
you're not paying much for this tablet
so this tablet is perfect for children
that's why it's perfect for them
if you have children that tend to break things
this tablet is perfect for them
not only is it durable
because it's all plastic but it's only 50 dollars
i don't know if i could say that more
i probably said that about 10 times already
i mean it's perfect for that
this tablet is perfect for that
so is it worth it
it's so cheap that of course it's worth it
so you don't miss any of our new videos
are you ready students parents and teachers here we go
I offer to you take last
P 10 HD 10.1 Android tablet review
Kanna tablet this chip very reliable
let's find out about the tick last p10
it comes with the massive 10.1
iPad you can shop also in www.h
you make up your mind
the good thing is 10.1 inch IPS
yes very check the could be better fragile screen
no poor cameras no no fingerprint reader
searching no way can you get the
Tecla speeds or pittin HD
of course all year at lazada
that was down to around 225
PPI less than apples on iPad 2019
hopefully the class will release a fix for this soon
overall though it's a great display with good colors
viewing angles and good thoughts responsiveness
this makes it extremely fragile
it was the first tablet to come out
so what does this mean in laymen terms
quality is not amazing as you would expect
turn out onion soup unusable
here camera is only 5mp
front camera is only 2
so how good is the battery life
well as we mentioned the p10 eats the racks
you will need to keep the device
sims are not common with tablets
apart from this you get access to dual band
bloated 5.0 is also included to help you
connect with your wireless headsets or other accessories
it's a no-brainer tablet for watching Netflix
and videos there are better options
do you want disappoint you
where can you get the
Tecla speed on its d
I am the affiliate marketing of eBay and also lazada
does it look like a kindle fire
uh yeah but daddy's gonna open it with me
that's it so you have inside charger
oh my um it's so big
it's almost as big as you should
really be able to edit videos
we gotta get this case on it fast
there we go there we let's go
which one do you want
try asking alexa to play music or movies
make calls check the news or your favorite
it's good just say alexa
to get your tablet's attention alexa
what's the weather currently in olympia
and find what you want to watch alexa
here's what i found with show mode
i don't know if you figure it's mostly kids
i've put this on all my devices
you can even scratch it
i saw some where they had keys
hi in skyyy and welcome to hardware heaven today
it's very very interesting so first off
you won't have to worry about that
it pretty much works exactly the same way
Google Chrome you can go to the Google Play Store
it all works perfectly fine your calendar etc etc
my particular favorite is a game called a Reaper
it's completely free up to a level 10
you basically players this repr
who has a really big sword
it's like the pale swordsman
it's always the ice storm test that you'll run
I can slide on the tablet with complete ease
there's no sort of lag
occasionally there is a little bit of graphics lag
I absolutely love the design
but that's just a little picky thing on my behalf
the analog sticks work perfectly
I feel that it's a good width
you can hold it comfortably
I really like the way they have designed it
and you simply plug in
I much prefer this on a tablet
you've got a bigger screen
it's really really nicely into the controller
doesn't feel like anything's gonna fall out
I think is a complete bargain
is this kind of thing
gets more and more popular
I don't really like that
make sure to check out
leave a like and subscribe to this channel
which we're not gonna actually talk through
it's more of an exhibition style
inch is the nova 3 color
what's going on i'm ryan from technically
well i'm checking out the dragon touch
10 tablet the dragon touch
meaning that does not look washed out from the side
video playback works well allowing you to stream
YouTube videos in HD with minimal stutter
you'll find a headphone jack
the charging port a full sized
the building cameras don't take stellar pictures
10x is ideal for school and business
alike the detachable keyboard case
is it very easy to transport and the familiar
I've just received my tech lusty
this is a flagship tablet brand-new
what's in your box first
it's arrived with the battery
so just ready to go now
this is literally just as I love unboxed
so that's no great issue first impression it comes across
it's the clarity of the screen
that is it really is remarkable
this is by far the best screen
any budget tablet phenomenal phenomenal sharp
this is straight out of the box
it's nearly completed downloading of great
now take we are so now
we're updated to the latest version
it's nice to actually see that with
we've got some current updates to fix any inevitable
so one of the new features of the tech
I just touch it briefly
it's back on works exceptionally well
if we go to settings here somewhere fingerprint right
confirm your password at fingerprint
I've already put two but I'll do it again
then touch the sensor again you'll fingerprint detected
my hands of it sweat is exceptionally hot here today
we've gotten there we go
I just try that again
the package is this which appears to be a standard
we are on the edge with the with the speaker
you've got a a micro
I just want to talk about the charger
it is a fast charger
Express charger with five seven nine and 12 volt amperes
I've no complaints at all with it
I'm very impressed with that
the speaker or your speakers on it dual stereo speakers
I think for the first time certainly first tablet
you know cheap budget tablets
you all know what they're like
the front-facing camera is just amazing
what else have we got
there's GPS installed as well and the battery life
well it's that that's another big surprise
I suspect it will probably run for about ten hours
we've got the fast charger as well
so when you need to charge it
being a large 10 inch tablet
so so that for me just using it on the
Wi-Fi is absolutely fine so overall impressions with it
I can't really fault it in any way
so yeah there you are
that's the tech last master t10 tablet
I've got a bit of a different thing
that aren't well annoying so not too long ago
I've been using the same
I do digital art and animation
I wanted to quickly go over the boxing now
I know but I really appreciate a pretty box
no amount of crazy shipping shenanigans
let's dive right into it
the drawing surface of this tablet is silky smooth
I don't know how else to really describe it
drawing on it is such a pleasant tactile experience
it's nearly eight times more sensitive which is crazy considering
I was worried about you
I have to worry about
is cat hair in the bottom of the pen
I'm not going to forget this
vital piece of equipment anywhere
Wacom I worked with before
I'm no stranger to charging my digital devices
the pen does not have an eraser side
it's not too big of an issue for me
those pin buttons are just really easy to accidentally press
I started to get this weird glitch
I am overall very pleased with my experience
Colin Smith here and today
I've got something really exciting for you
this was my very first
Wacom tablet just to show you
this was a ox-head - and you can see here
tear everything out of the box here
I've got all the goodies right here
it's got some decent weight to it
we've got the pan of course we've got the
Wacom pen too and yes
is these little accessories which we're going to jump into
this baby here works by default on
there's no lag or anything
don't forget to update the firmware and
I'll show you exactly how to do that right now
what you want to do is just tap on here
one of these is touch
we want the touch ring to do
this is where it feels really nice
the other thing we've got is these nice little rings
I can just pull the red off
it's going to paint now one of the things
that's one of the big changes
eight thousand one hundred and ninety-six
we could do the back button
have the front button sits or right
click the back button said to the brush tools
well what are those brush tools going to do now
we can go to those easily enough
Photoshop we hit that back button
of course we can hit that
little cog at that little wrench there
it's a hard to put in full
so what else we got here
well we've got the touch
we've got many things we can do with the touch
we can do the touch options here
let me just using my finger right now
they will do different things
and you can see you know
we've got photoshop shortcuts panel shortcuts
okay so here we are in our
why don't we under photoshop
let's change this to a keyboard shortcut
what if you want to cool it okay
zoom cycle layers brush size rotate
I really want to do
I like the way it works
I like the way it feels
so there's the before image
I recommend it put that about
you need to get a tablet because without a tablet
it's great you can draw
this is the tool you want to get and so
I would recommend this one without any reservation
there's no delay and weres fantastic
of course you can plug it in if you want
I'm probably not going to plug it in
Pro is the touchpad so I'm probably gonna
I hope you enjoyed it
what do you think are you using a
are you impressed by this
is this something you want so anyway guys
thanks for watching until next time
I'll see you at the cafe
I would like to mention that
this is not a sponsored review
this was a replacement for my old
it seems to be their new entry-level beginner tablet
they don't sell the artists anymore
so not only is the cheapest emotional sports well tablet
it's also the replacement for my old tablet so
I was not contacted to do this
I don't believe in a dishonest review
that are watching it so once again
this was exactly the case
they've gone for here is absolutely stunning
it looks so much smarter on the desk underneath this
Ferentz this is your warranty policy
next up is my favorite feature of this entire box
it's got an interesting invention
turn the plug socket on and your tablet
it's ready to go drive
a set up for the tablet was also incredibly easy
you simply go to their website and download
this like the unique tabla
it has six sort cookies and one touch bar
these days and that is by no means an issue
the pen is battery free
I don't have too many
I already finished the image
this image one is a companion piece to the artwork
it feels so much more actually stood drawing experience
this tablet retails for 199
unfortunately but it did get me about it
got me about thirty pounds off
this is definitely a fantastic option to go with
I still fully recommend the Veeck range
NS lasted me for years before eventually
I really have to say on the table overall
10's new actually cost more than this tablet
did it was 300 pounds for the artist 10s
meanwhile this was only a hundred ninety-nine at full price
how long do this function just five
that's all I really have for now
I hope you enjoyed the video don't forget to
Like and subscribe and let's art by nature out
hi Dave Taylor here again and this time
I'm looking at the Samsung Galaxy Tab E
they call them the 10 inch tablets
and you have to actually subscribe through your cellular service
a lot with soccer matches
but that's a whole nother
that's plenty for a day
that's even plenty for a transatlantic flight
you might want to put on here
this thing's really quite a little powerhouse
and you think immediately as I do
Samsung actually has something called kids mode and kids mode
it does have an audio jack somewhere
7s not having an audio jack
how much would you pay for this tablet
this is a 10 inch tablet
I don't know $5.99 $7.99
Windows fully within 10 seconds so
eleven point six seconds booted to desktop
actually it's smooth in operation
let's open to something is urging the browser
okay let's go up register
what's unique about this device is the solid-state drive
it didn't boot to ten seconds but 11.6
that's pretty fast full up faster than my PC
it handles everything very well
it's called browsing the web watching movies
play the games play very well on this
I hope you enjoyed the video
today we're taking a peek at the dragon
hey folks welcome back to techgooch and today
we're taking a peek at a tablet
this is not going to be something
that's going to compare to my ipad pro right
pro is a 700 bees
this is a octa-core tablet
in that regard it does have an ips
actually the screen's not too bad
i really wanted to see how it did
compared to like the iphone 10 iphone 10s
that was the the big ones
here's how to do the power
here's how to do that
here's how you do how you do this
how you unlock make sure you activate your warranty
obviously we do have a front-facing camera
it is usbc for its power charge
so that's that's where that goes
we're this is running android pie
you could do certain things with it
i'm not going to go through the apps
this is more on the on the tablet performance itself
that's from what i can tell
now i used geekbench 5 for its results
uh and so we can go with that right now
if you can you know the 5th gen ipad ran
does you know it's similar to those older devices
i would give it that
i i never go to debt
it's it is what it is
slated so dragon touch for 140 bucks
yeah it's it's 140 tablet
it's not gonna replace the ipads
i mean yeah we could watch a movie together
i guess but um more than anything
um but it's not crazy amazing and the screen itself
um it's not a bad display
i can't say bad things about it
it is nowhere near the cost of that thing
hey this is rick waldron with taylor
data systems uh we have jeff teague from honeywell today
you brought one with you
you know we've talked about it
it's an android and a windows tablet
it's got the mobility edge strategy
that honeywell has a couple things that are unique about
we've uh we've developed this
it also has a user replaceable battery
that will help you do that
jeff thank you very much for coming today
yeah thanks for having me
hi everyone this is to welcome to yet
this is actually a wireless tablet
so let's check it out
this is the packaging box for the star
0 6 wireless tablet as you can see
my box did not arrive in a very good condition
let's take a look at the things included
this is the pen stand
is that a manual and the resist glove here
the build quality is quite solid
there are six physical shortcut buttons
Photoshop brush sizes or zoom in and zoom out
overall the design is very clean and simple
this is the working area ten by six inches
there there's loop here that can hold a pen
I feel that this is a bit fragile
so be careful not to callus anyway
I seldom ever use this on the back
this is the power toggle switch for the tablet
I like the fact that this is removable
let's take out the USB receiver
the pen areas rather lightweight feels sturdy enough
holds quite well quite comfortable
let's take a look at the back
you can remove the tip very easily
the replacement tips are inside
I have already installed the driver
if you are left-handed you can change it here
your second temperature is monitor
this light will light up
this is photoshop cs5 on the Mac
so let's try to see the pressure sensitivity works
it does work quite well
maybe about 90 to 95% it's smooth
it seems that drawing at 100%
I get a slight jito now
this is now much smoother
let me zoom into 400 again so all those jitter
they are gone usually when drawing details
I like to use zoom in
so it's not really a problem
I seldom draw at 100% zoom
this is 200% zoom and
it's quite smooth as well
this is good mr. illustrator cs5 on the Mac
pressure does not work by default
at 100% the strokes are very smooth
this is mischeif pressure works very well
Krita pressure works very well
there are some features for example with illustrator
I think this is a pretty decent tablet
the build quality is quite good
I will put a link in the video description below
so that's all for today's review
I hope this is helpful
see you in the next video bye you
Oh today is a special day
I know what you might be thinking
look two videos in one week
it's time for a new one
I'm not used to the single
this is a weird angle
it's a screen that you can draw on
Brenna's opening it let's go
I just wanted to take a little peek okay
I just wanted to take a peek
okay wonder what it could be
I already smell it I already smell the newness
I cannot wait to open this
what and a bunch of cables hell
let me just tell you
what is it so hard hello once
I feel like tape or something
that's like keeping this together that
you know intermedia expert artists like myself
oh no it's got a smelter
Oh looks like we've got a tablet
there's a tiny globe all right
oh but it's spandex it stretches
I am a professional artist now
I have I have a glove
they even pack candy in here
oh yeah I love candy
I like look at this beautiful display
I'll do that when I install it
this is what comes in the box
ASMR this is for you
it looks like there's a lot of buttons here
I'm guessing to zoom in
Wow feels a little bit
flimsy feels a little bit light
but maybe that's what you want as an artist
it's pretty light but this is like cool
let's start drawing voiceover time awesome
okay first off a little background
this is someone who won the 10k raffle that
Rennick for letting me draw your fur soda
this is probably going super fast
where if you're just like barely touching the screen
that's one of the biggest critiques however
that actually turned out to be really nice
it would not erase it anymore for this pen
that took some getting used to but once
it made it make things a lot easier
I'm just agree to kind of like it
is it like touch sensitive
I don't see the use of the touch capabilities
because you're not able to pan with this pen
I've been using my my trackpad to do that
okay so after the sketch
I moved on to the liner usually
I thought it would draw if that makes any sense
I didn't know where my pen was landing on
this is my first display that
I'm drawing on so I don't
but it wasn't really that major of a problem
it was just kind of a something that bugged me
I'm traditional so I wore the glove and it
it was a little bit of a step down
it was very easy to do
I'd have to say that
I've been doing all these years
I've been trying to do this whole time
the foreign dollar tablet 15 inch display right
so it's already quite a bit
so is this article tablet worth the money
I have to say yes
experience was not really all that frustrating
I had a lot of fun drawing with this tablet
this is the drawing this is a the handsome caribou
Rennick and I had a lot of fun drawing him
all for sending me your tablet to review
BAM look at that beautiful
I'm gonna get back in first
so that was my review
swipe down from the top right and tap
it's great for playing games and watching
USB charging port and micro SD card slot
we got this tube a flat screwdriver
it was wedged between my computer chair
i can explain also if you open up the back
it has a full 21 inch drying display
and it's very easy to install
watch yes i know a lot of you are asking
where is the thumbnail though
well here is the process
just watch how i do you
is it worth the money
does it really live up to the hype
I was sent this by Vaughn
so here's the headlines first of all
I'm going to take a deep breath
I do like that it has that older gen iPad
No sabore but that's nothing unusual at this price bottom
let's talk about the screen
I want to see too often
edits of all the stuff
I review here on the channel
I do actually read the comments
Call of Duty mobile and pub G mobile
Netflix and YouTube has been totally fine performance
I'd say that for your average consumer
it is more than equipped for browsing the internet reading
so here's the pros and cons
the cons are slightly underpowered
well not quite with the fire 10
that isn't held to ransom by Amazon
and that's something that the fire 10
HD will never be straight out of the box
this tablet is very thin which
starting on the top of the tablet
you have four macro keys
lastly you have settings for your radial menu
this tablet costs around 100
i love this tablet for my kids
what's really nice about it is
it's a perfect size for their hands
they can hold it and grip it really well
is this app called kiddos
because it has age-appropriate things on it
my kids are better at this than me
and so that's some of the things you can do
you have duo you have family group
it is connect it to wi-fi and it's ready
everybody dan here from text
affordable tablet comes with an 8 inch
IPS screen front and rear facing cameras
it's very lightweight and for me that means
I have a lot more room in my tech bag
a big shout out to van
next is the s8 tablet
you will find the power button
USB port the SD card slot and the headphone jack
and for those of you who don't know
alright the tablet also has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor
2 gigs of ram 32
gigs of storage expandable up to 128 gigs
also the tablet has 2 cameras
it has a front facing camera
ok so I know I gave you some specs
but let's go ahead and actually unlock the tablet
i have a 32 gig
SD card gear right now
so it's given me the extra storage space
I come over to CPU
they'll let you know that this is a quad-core 1.3
it can only connect to 2.4 gigahertz
the 5 gigahertz band is not supported on this device
battery life is really good
let's go ahead and turn that down there
very nice and then have some other information down here
I'm locking it in place
let's check out some gameplay now
give this a shot for the sake of this video
I've been playing a little bit
I'm doing betting a thought
well any race that you can finish
guess it's a good thing okay so
this tablet has two cameras
even though the black guy can go first
okay now as you can see the videos in pictures
I know a lot of us
this video is sponsored by galman
they sent me the m1220 drawing tablet
if you can say that
but i don't know this
precious box contains the tablet itself with a few
it also has the back for the tablet
this bag that contains the extra pen nibs inside
that doesn't mean because my phone is small
i would like to clearly mention that
the tablet only works for android devices
it doesn't work for ios so sorry apple users
let's talk about the tablet
i could just do that
i do love the rubber part of the pen
coat died two years ago
uh so here's a story on how
this all started back on sixth grade
i was also that kid that watches vines
i didn't know what i was going to
it also came across that uh sans anonymous comics
where sans would just flirt with a person
uh so that happened but everything's all normal
i noticed that this particular student was drawing a character
i went back to my suit with a panic
there's someone that knows undertale
that's also in my class
their drawing is so cool
they went uh yeah glitchtale betty
we became good friends by them
they also have good sense of humor
i was 11 to 12 like 11 turning 12.
she was inspired by undertale
they're so cute together they said and i reply
i didn't want to do that
i kept doing that for months
i even made alt accounts saying that
oh i know what so
that's the whole story of young me being all done
thank you for staying till the end of the video
by the way spooky s1 has edited edited
this is the drawing i made with using the tablet
thank you to galman for sponsoring this video
excuse me i am begging you for a screen tablet
Mark Warren from mark Warren photography and
I'm back with another video today
3 which was a great tablet for me
I would lose connection so it had to go
this tablet is nothing short of amazing
I can basically use my finger to control the mouse
I can use two fingers to right-click I can use
three fingers left to actually change to a different window
three fingers right goes the other way
that are pretty cool about this tablet again
it'll pop up on the screen
what those buttons are configured for so right now in
Photoshop I have it set up for duplicate layers
circle clockwise makes it hard
it's touch sensitive as well so
I can use it as a mouse
I have a quick radial menu
I have an action setup
you know different brush capacities that
I might like use frequently
so it's really cool the customization and it's insane
I can toggle between the different colors or right-click there
touch is on and again
and then it can double click to tap and click
two fingers will bring up right clicks
and then you've got zoom and rotate options by pinching
especially if you're trying to zoom in or zoom out
three fingers left or right will navigate to different windows
it's pretty cool like that
all the customizations that you can do with this
I am loving the things you probably
I haven't experienced any problems like that at all
it's still a great value
this comes with some pre bundled software
so you can get Photoshop Elements 10
there's some plugins and some trial versions of Corel Painter
this is an awesome tablet like said
it's few bucks more than the bamboo
I hope you enjoyed this video
we'll have more videos coming at you soon
Oh what is up my peepholes
Android tablet a short time ago
oh but they are not sponsoring this video everything
what you're actually here for is the tablet itself
this is a 7 inch
Android tablet running Android 9 pi
it has a 1024 by 600
IPS display 32 gigabytes of onboard memory
RAM a Mallee T 820 GPU
you're going to find a reset
you're going to find the headphone jack
the microUSB port and underneath this protective flap
SD card finally on the back
I've set up a little demonstration now
Netflix Hulu and Amazon Prime video
thanks to all of the ads
they shoved in there another reason
I'm using to be for this
they can get a little toasty though
I tend to hate those things and if I can
this game is a grid-based first-person dungeon crawling RPG
you're good to go one of the other main things
it does have a feature that
Wi-Fi nor does it record 1080p video
it's stunningly sleek and its touchscreen capabilities
glass this allows for bright and full colors again
I love with this device
that's included in the package
that really gives you that
should you prefer it a helpful
Windows 10 Pro 64 options with Windows
it was the option for
we found seven to eight hours to be more accurate
well that's all for now
don't just build a tablet
they build a complete ecosystem of products around their tablets
I use their motion computing f5
there's a desktop docking station
spare car chargers car battery chargers
it's the fourth generation has well chip
pull the battery out now
you can do that while the unit is running
we've also got our docking connector here
here this area here you can see is modular
doesn't replace the need for a password
it's a really nice and generously sized
but of course you can if you need to run
you've both got the ability to run
that's probably more than enough in terms of screen resolution
it works really really good
I pull the pen away
it's not necessarily in a rough environment
you can see my hands here
the old are the old f5
this is my first ever tablet that
so that's kind of how that came about
this is a more budget oriented tablet
the MSRP is about $150 to that end
I also have gotten a budget oriented tablet case
I just said I wanted to get a case
I got this one from the new egg market place
it's a bit cheaper than the official
so let's start off with the why question
I buy this product well basically doing what I do
it's not really a PC replacement for me
I was like oh well that seems pretty reasonable
it's a 7-inch 1280 by 800 IPS
you have a 286 mega its power
VR SGX 5-4 for mt1 and GPU
and this is a pretty decent
BG and the Wi-Fi only has a single 2.4
Asus is providing the center 480 of colors
this is the blue one which has a matte finish
and then you also have volume and power buttons
I'm not ecstatic about the placement of these
that's not really what I bought it for
this is primarily web browsing while sitting on the couch
this is a budget tablet
I would even really complain about if I wasn't doing
life is something I should mention
I know Kyle has one of those
spend maybe 70 80 bucks more
but yeah leave me many comments
we'll see you all next time
this model has a backlit keyboard not all models do
it works great on your lap
this model is a $800
usually the keyboard comes with all models
six hours definitely is achievable
CPU intensive could take a toll overall
the design is kind of nice
you can play games on it
I like the keyboard which is pretty responsive
as soon as it's connected you can start typing now
I don't love about it is down here
there's six keys over here and that's something that
and it looks pretty great
strong magnets are detached the screen
and while we're doing that
let's go ahead and file open image that
recently err and you can see
it's the picture looks pretty small
my handwriting is not great
I'm not very good at this game
I just happen to have this
quality set to very high
the game is very playable
probably should've brighten my screen
it almost is a velvety surface
so that's a look at the
let's go ahead and type in my password
this way is kind of hard there we go
video since we've got this high resolution screen
I'm going to go ahead and mute
that's actually not what I wanted to do
that's 1440 video and that
I can get that tab to come out
let's do a 1080p video at the same time
I guess she's cooking and doing calligraphy
hello everyone in this video
i'll be reviewing this android tablet
and this is the m6 model
i'm going to go through all the features
just swiping through the tablet
this is the first tablet that i've reviewed that
they provide all these accessories
so you've got that nice protective case there
i'm sure it requires batteries
i don't can't even open this
and that's the micro usb charging cable for the keyboard
you can actually take this off
i've managed to open it now
it takes two sims so you take sim
this is the reason why i really like it
because of those reasons plus i love the build quality
okay let me just switch on now
the touchscreen is very smooth easy to use as well
few apps built already built into it
around 12 gig is already used up without downloading anything
but it's just a just how smooth it is
the touchscreen is very smooth
playing games is very smooth
it has a very large speaker as well
the sound quality is amazing
build quality is very good
and i think i've taken a picture as well
where's the gallery gallery gallery
it should be somewhere here
decent mega pixels to do video calls and stuff
please do give a like and subscribe
iPad you can get this at Amazon
but it's lightweight it's pretty cool
what their kids are doing in this
iPad isn't that pretty cool it also has
Google assisted the Play Store and YouTube
you can download lots of cool apps
hey look this baby shark
let's download baby shark app
see if you want to change the wallpaper

so what do you guys think about this
I recommend this for like like little kids first
we thought it was pretty cool
if you haven't already okay
bye guys thanks for watching
see you in the next video
good bye and now for our giveaway question
the question is what is my favorite color
yes that's it and good luck
this is going on youtube um anyways yeah
let's just do it okay so here
we are at the tablet review part
let's start with the tablet specifications
the resolution is 1920 by 1080 which is perfectly acceptable
your os is not supported
i was a bit skeptical about but ended up
the pen also has a rubber grip
that is very nice to hold so much
that was a joke but it is a great pen
alright now let's jump into the cons first of all
i used this with the program
what i mainly encountered with
all of a sudden this'll move
i got it to move before it literally
just doesn't want to huh
maybe it's because my cursor was on the screen
oh my god is that it
oh that's totally a huion problem bro
but it was a small hiccup i encountered
i'll give a list style summary
we have it works very well overall
it's easy to set up has a nice big 21.5
inch and good looking screen
would i use this tablet personally
i posted the animation that i made on twitter
chuwi ipad lte tablet review
they're no more cheap looking and plasticky
that has a micro sd card choice too
the keyboard pins the keyboard case
plays the double job of shielding the 10.1
inch tablet together with raising its productivity
this chewy tablet computer is promoted as an amusement device
should you enhance the brightness to max
there's a workaround for this issue
charger didn't really accelerate this procedure
the chuwi ipad lte has its own set of issues
the touchscreen encounter isn't ideal
the ui experiences occasional lags
kindly see the description for this amazon product link
I won't actually be fixing stuff
there is no ball two of these is
I actually have two daughters
I mean if there's actually anything in the box
point for OS a one together
five hours might be five hours on standby home
i think i'll have to actually test for this video
I 10 to 11 BG in a Wi-Fi capability 0.3
3 15 min out their application marketing
I remember things like telephoned with wires
I have just one down there
then here you go fill your boots young man
hmm brillion party genius perrier award in making anyway
it's actually quite a robust box for the price
so what do we have here
guide is probably very very useful
we know what these things do
it's impossible to transfer files to and from the tablet
oh my good stuff so yeah really rubbish
what we have here okay well
there's some kind of foam bag which is always good
and let's looky here no hang on we won't
let's have a look at the accessories first
alright so what do we have here
there's actually something in here
so it's actually very very standard
please a kit but nice
it is supplied or pop down there
USB cable this must be the on-the-go cable it sure
Joby let's have a look nice
good for a forty seven quid
let's have a look at the back a spade
he's got a lovely green sticker on it
okay so see if its powers on
so here's the tablets off
you might get a reflection me and trust me
nobody wants that so busby sevens and busy busy bees
droid clockwork thing working away
oh now that was quicker than expected to be honest
let's see what we've got here
no internet connection obviously and yeah android 40
then what do we actually have camera
settings browser email play music and must be apps
does this actually have the
choose some apps to add nap
see on screen touch and hold it
sounds a bit rude if you ask me
come on come back into focus
come back when I have charged the device back
I didn't actually move the camera
all the kitten kaboodle cuz
i'm going to pain in the backside
what i did do was go
because that's in the way of the wireless router
that was three monitors in the way my editing machine
oh well hush my mouth but like
uh let's go and look at apps
see what we've got abs wise games
like you have a choice
no idea that you're shopping download
we not going too fast here
I think it's cashing it to the SD card
so maybe that's it alright
you also got the back home apps list there
I don't even know who these people are
and welcome to google play music
it's quite a nice little interface pink
the camera is as you can imagine pretty poor ok
the quality is probably as you'd expect
so was it stopped out for now
good try to think what else we can show
that's interesting but i will say
I've put a little screen protector on here
you can do just like em
Thank You Birds is actually loaded now
i'll hit the wrong icon
those over this is a game called
and she likes this one allegedly
crash noodle cake games yellow monkey
who's going to try and sell me something immediately
let's actually go to the anchor birds
that are you sure you want to exit
we want to sell you something else
so well we'll just put that back pound
just get that in the center there
okay so cramped up beside your bed from there anyway
skip that and the instructions
ok so now everybody knows that
you can't be bothered to work it out
consider yourself one of us
go see yourself one of the family
Oliver yes Beauty has up straight into the action there
I won't take up any more of your time
subscribe to get your fix lemon
this is lisa from mobile tech review
10 tablet with intel 11th gen cpus
u-series cpus the lower power
ones like they use in
i mean given how small this screen is
i don't have anything against the surface type cover
it doesn't make kind of hollow funky sounds
the thinkpad is meant to be abused a bit
that's how thing pads are
so i mean it's a tablet
so that's wonderful to have docking stations
think shutter privacy shutters so nobody can spy on you
yeah that so the display on this again
it's full hd plus resolution
i think that's fine for the display size
nits we actually measured significantly over
you can see those metrics on screen right now
it's probably not going to be your first pick
you could do art on it
it didn't get burning hot to the touch
it didn't ever get noisy
something like that you know
42 watt hour battery which is good
not bad the kickstand on this man
no problems no wobbling no shaking
so that's definitely a go on this
and there's an eight megapixel world-facing camera not bad quality
it gets the job done
i'm lisa from mobile tech review
well you're right well done
you can successfully predict the future good for you
would you like to see the
I've no idea what that says
but you know be a bit impolite right
PC would you believe it
let's put that to one side for the second
see what else is in
not a lot is the answer
CDR containing drivers could prove very useful
it's far better built than the Android tablets
I've been looking at much much nicer
in fact it's got these sort of hard metal
Android tablets have looked tattooed
this is what we call a screen
it is a capacitive touchscreen
we shall get back to that
look camera has built-in microphone
there is a power light
there is the microphone which begs the question
let's try that again there
that's not actually active there
nothing on the other side except some screws
nothing on the back except some
7 to take ages to start on a tablet
ah well that's fairly easy
need your daily dose of cute now of course
I don't don't be ridiculous as a web browser right
it's like an awkward child brother
go on as I say it's kind of obscuring
the view however as with windows and all such things
yeah my previous experiences of the handwriting
you is stuffed kind of a king harp actually
if you're old enough right it's say
good writing from this angle
will it get it yay there
I'm going to search for something
Oh given half the chance I always do BAM there
okay that's a bit touchscreen e so now
I suppose we can have to look at specifications
well the screen itself is capacitive
obviously and is very very nice
it's a very precise feels solid
it doesn't ever miss your taps or anything
it's got an atom in 4 five process
why don't we check manage please
Inc there we are yes indeed
it is an atom in four five five
transfer speeds like on the expensive desktop
SSDs you can buy and plug into your main PC
that's about all there is to say
Intel graphics media accelerator 3150
one word to that boo
well pretty well is the answer to that it's well
I happen to have here
it's an intra actually that
oh sorry shouldn't sing along as you can see
it plays nicely but can it play it
just don't show you the end bit
look it looks like an old
that's a bit of a problem
where's that sort of 720
576 and it seems to play
what comes after specifications battery life
it still seems to last about three hours
that seems a bit odd
shall we have a look through it
isn't that round in real life
almost that's a little bit weird isn't it really
I'm giving away my setup
I want if I can go
I won't find out till playback
what a pointless experiment anyway here
I'm going to mention a program a specific program
there's this really cool tablet
this is what happens when you've got a keyboard
delete get rid of that
let's go through all programs
I'm gonna set that up
look it's like a special effect entron or something
I don't know if this is
it's fairly nippy as these things
get on with it nearly there
I'll know it all ran a bit art
there we go it does actually select everything
we are not something to do very often
that's a really fair comparison
but it's gotta be done
they keep for that express purpose
it's like smaller screen slightly smaller
I suppose and why are we talkin
technical things avoiding the obvious elephant in the room
it's all about how you use it
on the operating system windows
this is an absolute breeze
it doesn't destroy all the data already on your iPad
so yeah that's sort of good in that respect
what is not so good
is that a very little tablet specific software
is that going to improve massively
so what do you want
what do you want to do with it
oh wait we haven't gotten to price yet have we
mind you 3 hours battery life 10 hours battery life
what do you need it for
this comes down to that dreaded pathetic ending again
where if you've watched this video and thought man
I could really do one of those
I wouldn't recommend getting one really
I mean you know do important work on the train
so that's been very very good for me
the room was very nice
the shops out of stock coming up one of eBay
well mama but which really surprised me
I imagine this is his desk with his PC
stand just sitting there like that
somebody skypes him or down
I can't remember the name of it
this doesn't draw much juice
I'll ask him about that
a bit like a screwdriver with a spikey handle you
Karen Pocket all calm today
let's open this up and see what's inside
this is a very slim box
let's turn it over and see what we have
some general information these are specification
they're supposed to be an 8 gig memory somewhere
Drive I'm going to find it out later anyway
the working area is ten
Koosh in just behind a front cover to protect tablet
so this is the tablet
there's this a claw here
I think is to put the pen
I'm gonna try to out later
it has a very smooth surface
put this back here and this to you back here
okay this is a new design
this is quite good so actually
cap comes with two buttons as well
put this here like this it
the new design of the cable is much better
I'm going to demonstrate the performance on some selected software
then there's the screen setting let's see what is this
is the pen pressure test
ok if you are left-handed user
you can check this box here
I'm using ooh yawns version
I'm going to pick a brush
let me zoom in for you
they do not paper as well compared to
probably that is closer to a
Wacom tablets the way their strokes taper
this is the only issue that I face with Photoshop
other software they do not have
they have their brush to that
also can use pen pressure so
let me change the settings first so right here
this is a very nice software
this seems like mischief has no problems at all
let me try some quick hatching
Pro is a free drawing application
which has a lot of features dedicated to drawing manga
I really like this software
how do you recommend this this is mischeif
I mean sorry this is mini Bank paint crew again
this is a pasady brush
this transition is very nice
if you happen to be using sketchbook well
this tablet looks fine on sketchbook
too so with sketchbook again and pressure works very well
the transition is very smooth
I think they have a very good product here
it's a really good plugin with all the other software
there's no problem we just have that
that's all for my review today
see you in the next video bye
Sometimes it's a gamble when it comes to budget technology.
which is expandable and a 10.1 inch IPS
screen for great viewing at many angles.
or at least until everyone is updated.
The touch screen is pretty smooth and responsive.
At the top of the screen
there's also another camera with a flash next to it.
And in case you're curious, here are the highest resolutions
there are only power and volume buttons.
Next to those is the memory card slot.
it won't run on cellular networks.
To add more storage, the DragonTouch Max
For video recording, the headphone jack
also doubles as a microphone input!
But there are a few of things you'll need first.
This is because the official Max
10 camera app doesn't accept external microphones.
it looks like a standard
Y-splitter but It's wired differently internally.
I think that the DragonTouch Max
so hello ladies gentlemen and viewers
today i received a graphic double summer company
the package contained a lot of stuff
black put into my hands was standard
i didn't know how to set it then
i attach the tablet into the laptop
this may seem very very hard but believe me
the screen itself is 15.3
inches widescreen full hd screen and have 16.7 million colors
the screen is also suitable for artists
who have long term exposure to digital drawing
when i started to draw on the screen
it felt almost like a paper
the bed pressure has 8192 levels
which i think is pretty high for a low class
that cost usually more than 400
i personally don't use the standard this
i'm used to draw or paint on paper
the graphic tablet is very light
stay like two hours or they did shut it down
it depends from your left or how good it is
the only back the top will have that
and then it's fine other than that
identify any serious issue with this product
i've been using like a two weeks daily now
i would like to talk about the durability
and maybe that's what made it scratch
i don't exactly know so
it's been a little while
said i was going to review this reversible laptop tablet
we're gonna do it you ready
lightweight pc here comes look
they packaged it real well
it's nice and compact and secure in there
it's wrapped up real nice over here
it's got a nice little wrapping
look how shiny that is
wipe that off all right
there's the uh charger and hdmi
i believe you can put an hdmi in there
and then they got a couple
it's like i said it was reversible
i'm about to flip it
that thing's cool captain spectra nice and clean
it's got six core 9th gen intel
i7 um got the geforce gtx
that's right so i do all my editing
all my 3d modeling to draw it
it's a little harder than i thought it would be
whatever kind of program it is
i suggest you get that
because it's a it's a mean machine man
that fingerprint sensor camera microphone
you want to live stream some editing
i could probably do that
how's it going guys so
it's got four point two
so it's it's really not bad
I was almost kind of impressed
I wouldn't I can't say too much
emulators are like you can play
like gameboy games or intend
it's not bad to be honest with the
I feel like I'm forgetting something here
I mean not too much
I really can't say much more about this
I would recommend one of these alright
I hope you liked this video
a lot of people often ask me
I'll be covering these two first off
we have the gamma s 56k
it's marketed as a stylus pad for the rhythm game
you can fit 4000 digital lines
you probably won't notice anything over 2,000
here's the QuickStart guide and the driver CD though
we don't really need that
you can download it on their website here
stylus was also like this and personally
kind of like a normal retractable pen
I don't recommend trying to fold it all the way
I am actually drawing as you can see
the tablet feels definitely different from what
I can confirm that it actually works pretty well
I've tried in the past
it might start chittering randomly
you could adjust that this is selecting your monitor
I currently have three so obviously
you'll notice that it's kind of more rectangular in here
I'll draw another one probably a little bigger
this is in the full area
it'll actually look more like a square here
I'll draw another one little bigger again
so things aren't weird because it before doing that
I'd like to do to test tablets is I guess
that's many mistakes is basically how
which is why we have the convenient smooth tool
but if you are gonna do more detailed art
I've got to draw the rest of my hair
yeah there's something you don't see normally
increase increase my speed but right now
I'm a little bit rusty
um this kind of tablet but it works you know
it's cheap and it's great
all a brand new released
Android OS with eight inch IPS screen now
all the typical feature would let you decide that
s8 package include one leaflet from manufacturer
IPS technology screen with 1280 by 800 screen resolution
SIM card option as well as the earphone out
you can't really fault much around it everything every
Buzzle is fantastically done like a premium in quality
I have to admit that screen is fantastic
Android 9.0 with the RAM of 2 gigabytes
and on top of it
Giga bytes of system storage
actually that's quite a lot to be honest with you
obviously the new systems are taking little bit long
you know quite a lot of memory
now in terms of battery
life tablet is installed with the 2,400 million pair
our battery are using this all settings
fold all the typical products
YouTube application on the tablet is fantastic
just keep adding the tab in there so
it's not a edited version or anything like that
you just keep adding it
not mixing up with anything
perfect is pretty fast as well
I only notice by using this application called FM radio
go straight away work without any problem
we have all the typical applications which are pre-installed
starting with the calculator calendar
you can use them too now
here is your front camera on it now
click on to this menu button and press this here
well you can see me right in there
the response of a screen is pretty decent
actually while playing again him with the
it's basically a shifting between landscape and portrait
we are in a landscape mode
let's go into portrait now
another main purpose of me
great it updates everything very quickly
let's play this movie right in here
I liked the most about this tablet as well now
good enough for you or not
that is that tablet worth buying or not
Android operating system is using the latest one
can it play the games yes it can
can it play the videos on
yes it can can you use it on the
Plex for the external media player
this tablet is worth buying from my side
that would be all from my side guys
Brad Linder with little beauty and this is the cube
it's a pretty nice comfortable
now as you can see it's running
Google Android 4.4 KitKat software here
I've installed a number of different apps
it's a high resolution screen
looks pretty good for reading things
there's still plenty of glare
it it scores about what
have this wireless mouse that
and plug into the single micro
so let's go ahead and open up
but this is where we're shooting the video
it's going to open up the video here
probably shouldn't skip around but okay there
we go exhibit viewing angles are pretty good
I was good and see
so it should look good from different angles
it actually finishes it more quickly than any other
Intel Atom based system that I fried
now this is an image
that's 680 by 425 pixels
oh this is a really high-resolution screen windows tells me
is the picture smaller here
but these little file save you know delete etc
buttons are really really tiny
same thing happens with the image editing program
I had two applications running side by side
there is the option to do that in
but all of these little toolbar
don't really care what your
now there is a micro
there's a front-facing camera a rear camera
you can have to wait a minute
I'm mentioning them by name
that's a little bit quirky
it's about 6 to 7 hours of battery life
I'll show you is the inside
q qs' software here which there's a configuration utility in
I'm going to hit it
I'll just turn off the camera
chicks there from chicks tech reviews today
so this is the latest vo i8
Wow pretty impressed with the design so far
this is the latest model
I believe you can get the i8
I'll put the specs on the screen
so you guys can have a quick read
this has built-in dual band
Wi-Fi AC Bluetooth version for GPS and Android version 7.1
now the tablet weighs only 580 grams
and it's only 9 millimeters thin
the build quality feels very solid great design
I loved 180 degree kickstand
you have a very nice screen
so it's quite useful that this tablet has dual band
so here is my top performing
Android tablet chart for 2018
showing you all the latest
max has taken position 5 on this chart
I threw out with ease
games and movies looked absolutely amazing
I was not expecting much from this
that's all for this video don't forget to
see you the next one guys
hello guys welcome to a new video today
this tablet was very easy
I didn't have any hiccups
I didn't have any problems installing it
Sai the lines were much smoother and the pressure sensitivity
there were some initially wobbly lines
I have the smallest desk I could find in Ikea
so you're probably used to that anyway
so you can see how
the working area is 120 by 160 millimeters
I just used the shortcuts on my laptop
I have on my other tablets
the pen itself doesn't feel particularly expensive
it kind of feels a bit plasticky
this isn't a bad thing
it has a 10 millimeter reading height
I haven't played her yet
her name is Brandon L willow shield
she doesn't really know what she's got herself in for
so that's gonna be fun so yeah overall
I'm very impressed with this tablet
this one had no issues with the active area
there wasn't really any lag
but it's not a bad thing
and now it's 20 $6.99
I really hope you guys found this video useful
I hope to see you next time bye
everybody adhere with the digital digest and today
I want to point out this
this screen are slightly inferior to that of the 70
I think it's more a matter of that
they're simply maybe getting the panels from different sources
let's just leave it at that
moving away from the screen again
it's got the same front-facing camera same
I've gotten gadget up here
let me show you loading up another page again
so don't be shocked by that let's say
I guess for some loads up pretty quickly again
the 70 is meant to go mobile
pretty much will just bring up
so let's take a look at that again
we've got a little bit larger layout of ports here
you've got power down there at the bottom right
let's say on your bed or couch
it is a pretty tight
I'm overly impressed so far
there's your microphone by the way
don't let me forget that for your recordings at video
chat and overall really impressed guys

how is everyone doing today so today
this tablet wasn't sent to me
I do become the ug m7o
it comes with a ten by six active drawing area
it's a very nice and large active area
the largest active area means
usually the bigger is always better
Wacom tablets have over the Fuji tablet is their Wireless
this isn't a wireless one as you can see
you need to stick a used right here you speak
Abel goes right in there
the tablet features a nice
it gets very dirty but it's fine
it's fine there's no use to weigh
it's just just a nice design
it's very very delicate but I can
some of these do require batteries but the version
I don't like is the two bottoms right here
so you can pretty much
I prefer how I'll just prefer
how old just traditional pencils feel to be honest
it does come with a pen holder
uh there's not in there and here's the nib remover
I'm not pressing as you can see right now
I actually see a lot and a lot of people
I have here and I made a mistake
I don't really use this
don't know what it's for
I'm actually not sure what this is for side
I would definitely recommend you
this these are the buttons on pen
there's the barrel button one button one
there's different mouse commands right there
the only section left is supports digital ink
it works if you click supports digital ink
I'm not sure what you guys have so here
the lines are very nice and curvy
just like that something like that
but it's not that much of a butter
now we're gonna test the press since 50 so

I recently bought off at Amazon for $80
now the things that come with the
Wacom tablet are as follows
you have the stylus itself with two programmable buttons
you have a nice user
install help drivers software essentials that come with the
and scroll on the bottom
are this graphics tablet very useful in drawing like
click is pan and zoom if you're wondering where
I got this program I bought
if you're not hey guys
This is the Cintiq 16.
The Cintiq 16 is competitively
priced at 649 U.S. dollars.
All opinions in this video are my own.
The Cintiq Pros reach nearly 100% of Adobe RGB.
There is also an Advanced menu
that will let you control the
The legs have rubber feet that grip your desk.
So you could live without express keys.
Should your palm graze this area
they should expect from a budget display tablet.
everyone is going to appreciate the higher level of quality
the Cintiq differs from the imitations.
The feel of the screen is also very important.
2 is a premium pen.
Don't overlook pen quality when you buy a tablet
Pen tilt is only supported by a few Cintiq alternatives.
It's hard to show in a photo or a video.
The Cintiq 16 and its stand feel durable.
The drawing experience on the Cintiq 16 felt top-notch.
The pen didn't make any accidental marks or wobbly lines.
The Cintiq Pro 13 is also 1920x1080 HD.
that you'll find on the Cintiq Pros.
Honestly, the Cintiq 16 covers the essentials pretty well.
We'll start with the pros.
The Cintiq 16 is well-built with durable parts.
As I've said earlier, it doesn't feel cheap.
The anti-glare coating and parallax reduction worked really well.
The Pro Pen 2 is top-of-the-line and supports pen tilt.
The screen feel of the Cintiq
That way, you don't miss my new reviews.
The Cintiq Pro 16 is a fantastic budget
display tablet that provides the essential features an artist needs.
Sure, there are alternatives out
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
I'm really excited to show you this new product today
it's the Z 20 T from Toshiba
it houses a big battery that doubles effectively
Toshiba have built into the Z 20
now what that effectively means of course is when
so there's always been improvements in battery life
in addition to having the latest processor
there is a very small slot inside the tablet itself
just there for a small pen
something small skinny like that
i don't understand what the thing is with me doing
touhou art specifically of characters in suits and tablet reviews
yomu in a suit is just something that works
they didn't pay me for this review
aside from sending me the review copy of the tablet
we have a lot of screen
real estate to work with
wise and the artist 22 2g continues
i'm just used to xp pens
coming from an innovator 16 it's virtually no different
it comes with two cables to attach to the pc
adapter your hdmi cable and your usb connector
it also has a headset jack
this isn't specific to the artist 22
you have to unplug it and then plug it back
in the artist 22 fortunately fully shuts off the screen
it's a pretty simple work around beyond that
the drivers are as no frills as the tablet itself
xp pens routinely made great tablets and the artist
they're not paying me to say any of this
they just gave me the review copy
and this is my honest opinion of this tablet
everybody kind of goes through cycles with their art anyway
i still have yet to play any touhou game
also i love you bye you
ah that's a lot of buttons
the m106k pro pen tablet
we've got the tablet itself we have a
it's a bag feet like a glove
you know what else fits like a glove
this glove segway is going strong then
we have lots of paper
there are some manuals that has an untrained professional
i don't need to use driver
download a nice little note
then we have this and that
what's in these you'll never know
it's a bunch of pen
nibs and a pen holder mystery over some adapters
the cord and usb and the pen
we need to find the tablet to download the wait
what am i m106k pro
this tablet is much bigger than the pen tablet
i started out on and that was super duper
i used to struggle a lot
i use them avidly while making this speed paint
i didn't have one of these when i started out
it's it fits really nicely too
i have pretty small hands
i didn't find any glaring issues with this tablet
i'd recommend it to anybody starting out
it was really easy to use
this was a very great tablet to work with
it was an awesome opportunity
hold up real quick before you go
they're having a lightning sale on some of their tablets
so go ahead and check the description for those thanks
okay so first thing that
I loved about this week
it just looks like a chocolate bar
make sure you don't eat it
double that using two fingers to fit on the screen
the tablet is very helpful
this tablet is not compatible with mobile devices
of course it can be used with
you need to download the driver
it's very easy just single
well first of all it's battery free
the default one is for brush and eraser swap
and the other one for right-click action
helped me actually resolve that so
now remember this has a unique gesture pad again
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
here doesn't come with the card
you can put a card in here
we saw the same 7 inch
it was very easy to do
I'm sure this is gonna be rudabeh
l-- put your own apps on there
this guy zipped it right along nice improvement
though of the 16 gigs
it would be against the rules
so you're a more sandboxed here now
the fire is not bad you can see
that takes you back into your book
the newsstand movies music and apps
everything look at the books
I'm reading currently right here
they did a really good job with with periodicals
take a look at magazines
something that amazon can't offer but and then again
I would say for online support Amazon
still wins in terms of customer service
we'll take a look at that later
so here's the books that
we have a book open that
up with the quarters gonna set you up a bookmark
there's no eating professor a business
it's not an eating device it is an IPS
you can get your table of contents
turn that on and off
Kobo books Sony Reader Google Books
I side loaded this book
it's able to match up the book since
don't you want to look it up
it's nice it's a little compact wind out here
there's a shortcut a sea of Google
it does paginate that way as well
we take a look at applications
this is what I've got pre-installed right now
you've got an email application where Capri and IMAP email
it was so popular it does
Netflix works great on this by the way
there are some notable admissions like
I wanted to find a file manager
no kids is always a cool thing
there are some pretty cool
iPad books for kids too
but so you got read to me
read and record read greeting bucks
tomato car is read lolis
so is his sneaker fire
good for you there we go
well that's pretty readable for a heavily
so you're always going to have a real true
look at your photos as a bunch of sample photos
it comes with in video
that's what it plays works
it does remember where you were
hit stop and then come back to it alright
I know I'm you're probably excited by that
and by the way this does do Hulu
Netflix right now so we are playing Netflix
what this tablet does mean it access anywhere
Netflix is a bingo this is what your Netflix interface
it does also work in landscape mode
you can switch to a listing view
I like this better than Kindle
Fires a teeny little keyboard
I'll check out the New York Times
it's a very good experience there
and there was a embedded video on the front page
here was our website quickly enough
I'll pop it up to full screen
480p thanks fine place mafia
the controls are very usable as well
it's obviously an easy choice
this guy is epub based and it works with

it's just put back in its casing
it comes with a nice little foam pad in here
he's in like bleh download kind of cover
yeah it still has a hole for your camera
takes you to a nice lock screen
usually it's random probably like season
it has many apps already pre-installed like Microsoft solitaire
isn't that all that bad actually
I'll show you how good it is actually
I think I upgrade no
I thought this was windows
I'll show you like how it looks from cameras angle
the camera doesn't always work exactly
yeah ok back to the gallery

I think this was on my surface
the battery on here is pretty good
I mean I've charges for about 20 minutes already
it's already out like twenty percent
i recommend you get it
I hope you liked this review over here yay
I thought does a Saturday when I do this
you look like you're having fun all right
so today we're gonna talk about the fire
it's the new tablet for a 2 year old
and it's got a pretty nice foam case on it
you can get to all the buttons
it's lightweight she can hold it with her two hands
we ordered the super shield's screen protector
2-pack I only needed one
I have a link in the description
I found it on Amazon
it has cameras on both sides of the tablet
it's a very large and high-definition screen
this is the new version
leave comments if you have any questions thanks
hi everyone and welcome to this video
so that's what I'm going to do
so that's a really nice touch
it also comes with the installation
CD and the user manual along with two pens
I was really happy to see this
GT 191 tablets itself along with the stand
there's a screen protector that comes attached to the screen
love the stand with it
you're able to adjust the screen to any angle
you need which is extremely helpful
a lot of other tablets that
I've tried in the past
everything was fixed and it was working fine after that
it really helps to streamline the workflow
I've had so much fun making this video
I can't wait to attempt some large landscape paintings
I really appreciate this opportunity
unboxed just came in the mail today
can you know thumbnail on it
there are the battery to the end
the driver software it also comes with a software suite
I don't know if it says on the back yes
I'll be going over all those later
I had nice eyes though feel sky between the plastic
I've got the device up and running
maybe kind of an awkward
I don't know that you see one
in this case the front is middle
click for me now as you can notice
because you see this tablet down here okay
well and then you realize oh oh
I've crossed over to this other one by mistake
now some programs will override that for example now
goes back once you click on the desktop
okay so but the jump
cut there as you can see
pin notice probably does pin notice
I want to tell them
oh you want to click on that right there
but we don't want to so
why don't we exit that out
no well just delete that later and but like
sometimes they stroking the taskbar sometimes
it'll go back to letting you use two screens
it's supposed to let you sign your emails and your
that's but that is all that will run on
odds are they haven't updated it
hopefully they will in the future
those are pretty many programs but now let's try drawing
one it locks it to one screen
well that ordinarily is pretty good
I like but the problem is
let's see move that up file new
let's see if it'll do it again yeah
I don't know if you can tell
I chose cloned the screen show only on one there
any program like you know
unfortunately it was a serial it was in a USB
that has one of those
you'd have to build it yourself by buying a motherboard
that actually has a serial port still on it so
that's how much bigger this thing is
but it's all it enough
I have about this the and the pin base
I consider that part of it
this is an android version
so this tablet is very impressive indeed
and you can see a very wide screen
it's an ultra wide screen 10 inches 1080p display
it's a very very nice tablet
i've been really impressed with it
the processor inside is an octa-core processor
there's a little bit of lag as you saw there
also we do get a calculator calendar and of course
i think this is a really good offering
technology used the viewing angles are very good as well
that's it for this video
thank you very much for watching
but how does the tablet perform well
we're gonna go over that in a minute now
a pen tablet is a device
Apple itself while observing what
I'm John and what I'm not out saving the universe
I do tutorials and reviews on hardware and software
that's using a creative process
nowadays is a nice felt velcro pen case holder
there were two bag of nibs and a nib remover
and basically there you have it
there's your nice piece of kit right there
Pro is a pen tablet
one key is available to cycle through those modes
this is a battery free
this is one of the more unique pens
it's more like a clicky kind of gift
one is turning it off
I could see this being a hit
especially with a lot of the gamer guys
now right we all have these
RGB keyboards and you know
I'd see myself spending time
RGB profiles with my mouse and keyboard
man I really should get out more
okay going through the driver so real quick
this is the dashboard links to the website
this is where we set up our buttons test pressure
you're looking at this down here preference
unfortunately it doesn't map to the exe
maybe that's something we'll see later on
well there's no configuration needed
you just open up your art app of choice
I'm really trying to do here
is show that light medium to hard brush
strokes as far as pressure goes
I'm looking for moving on
I really want to make sure there's no pen lag
this is an EMR device after all
I'm seeing on screen is what's happening
I'm able to drop back to a nice light stroke
no tests are nice but you want to see
I tried out meeting the gradients
now one thing I do have to mention
I was experiencing but wasn't yet ready for primetime case
the tablet overall was fun to use
that's really the thing right you know
what's the experience with the tablet overall
I had a good experience
I liked the company and I like the slogan now
send me a beta one so
what's going on YouTube John here today
we're taking a look at the Sony
point2 and it runs it
I've tried with a skin on top
that comes close to pure
Android and being a Sony Tablet
you're going to find the 8.1 megapixel camera
do not take pictures with your tablet
I was very happy with the Sony
as well and runs everything
give me comments or questions about the
leave those down below in the comments section
hey guys the CTA Prime back here again
I'm just gonna be referring to it as the m16
the m16 does support a detachable keyboard
it'll only do 1080p out
so you can pick up that 5 gigahertz
8 megapixel rear camera 2.1 megapixel front and is running
Android 8.1 as for battery life
eight to nine hours mixed-use
I did check for updates
Amazon crime Hulu Netflix YouTube
it's telling me that it's running at 53
I have the new 2019
I actually wasn't expecting this
we get a bit of lag now personally
I've seen a lot worse on lower in tablets
I'm having here is the touch screen itself
I'm having with the screen here
transfers over to other games like pub
I also wanted to give a little emulation in here
I've tried OpenGL and Vulcan
it seems to run better with
Capcom 2 645 480 the lowest resolution
just to give you a look here
the internal resolution is set at 640 by 480
just isn't up to par for native
Android gaming or even emulation
but if you're buying a $200 Android tablet
I really appreciate you watching
hello everybody how you doing
here's your specs a processor
that on the tablet itself
check out sit right here
so here's your slots as you charge your port
and that's just a speaker on this side
got power there volumes plus and minus there
then you got a redo button there
that takes a rather long time to boot
is that if you wear glasses
it's done booting up now thank
your added donations now your unlock button there
this is running on 4.0
it's a pretty good picture
go ahead and clear up
I almost forgot me fix it
oh yeah okay as that runs on minecraft
I think it runs pretty good
looks good when you're chopping wood
damn so everything rolling here nice and smooth
I want to kill that chicken now
I leave it alone anyway
the jazz tablet runs real
is the back button right here
brings you to the recent apps
remember how long it took for me to load minecraft
free comes with along the flash player
it's pretty fast even though
I only have one bar of connectivity
and there's my review for the tablet
gasps you love from people you trust
I was doing the radio show this weekend
I think it was and somebody said
did you see that wind
let me tell you a little bit about it
it is an IPS screen
it's okay you can see my pin
it is a touch tablet
that's worth more than $59 in fact
I was thinking so he came with that
I'm set up all your stuff
was there all my stuff is there
Microsoft Office in a 7 inch tablet quad-core processor
don't be fooled by that
it isn't the super fastest process in the world
what's it like using the classic environment
it's I mean here's the issue with this
this is 1280 by 800
which on a seven-inch screen well you know
I almost would say ouch
the cool thing about this
USB port on the side right there is
HDMI full-size USB to not three
yeah and you could plug in a now
see how hard even at 1280 by 800
it's probably good enough for Skype
yeah that would be is my budget
I think that'd be the smart way to go
I'm trying can't see a little tiny
that's eight hundred by twelve
you don't feel like this is slow do you
I mean it feels like that is the first time
I've launched this cooking app so that's a little
I'm not I'm not feeling any
he's it's got 802 1011
B G and N it's an IPS screen
you know you're really you're not no
I feel like it's a king cake for Mardi Gras
I don't feel like it's that slow no
I'm using a lot of RAM here
I think this is pretty impressive
we're not clear on why it's so cheap
that would cost you more
you have to use your own existing version of
this is a good gift
yeah pros and cons the pros
if do we have a mini
it is a very surprisingly good for the price
very bright colors sound is not great
I would say that's a con
the cameras are super con
and it's certainly adequate for some you know lightweight computing
you probably want stick with the modern apps
I didn't mention battery life that's another Pro
this is just pretty impressive
yeah well you could fit $59
it's not a really expensive mean by five
I just - somebody says
can you show the keyboard
the keyboard is actually very usable
this is very much like an iPad keyboard
it's because it's seven inches
I like this win book
I'm gonna say that to the chat room
it's got predictive type and there goes boom
it's a win for the wind book
Wow Wow a full-size PC is seven-inch box
this tablet was affordable in
which will have that familiar interface all
it says the battery life is trash
I use poor man's ingenuity and just kept
use up too much memory for this tablet
most likely not worth it
thanks again for watching and as always until next time
hello everyone welcome to my channel
today we are going to unbox some
how do i open this thing
i i haven't unboxed anything in like years so well
i hope you guys have a good chinese new years
there we go all right
i'm just going to pull this thing up here
pretty nice this there we go here
here's tablet look like look
nice and neat smells good
we go nice all right
this looks pretty for me
i hope this one would be a good one
they've got like three buttons
okay next oh you have nice
oh nice let me show you
what's inside oh soft okay
oh these are the gloves and the usb 3.
this is like early in the morning
it's like 5 30 in that coffee
um this one doesn't have any battery on it surprising
wow it looks pretty solid amazing
i really loved it like it's pretty good idea
you have like the bag
let's try it out so that's the way you can
how does it hold up for and you know
i'll try to do something in photoshop
you just test out the topic
thank you very much since lab and um wow
it's surprisingly way better than i thought it would be
apparently not this one okay
it feels solid and the box
you can carry them everywhere
it's the pen got nice weight
just like the wacom tablet
uh like how the pen or the pencil
it is heavier than the wacom pen
i think you you are able to do it
they just send me the product so i can try
so that's just my honest opinion
i think this might be their first generation
i'm not sure but i haven't seen anything like it
everything works out just really awesome
it's it's like the first
i got kind of like taken away i was like
whoa um why is this
i think you will be surprised
i didn't have a lot of time
i mean honestly it is really good
it'll look like the cell phone in landscape version
which is why you're buying this in the first place
we do have still 18 hours remaining
all of this will change based on
you turn it for example if i tilt it down
you're starting to see more oranges and that is true
it's almost like you're looking at something
it's just kind of metal colored
if you're just joining us this is our lcd
it is liquid crystal display
you have absolutely no issues watching videos whatsoever
they will play at full frame rate
they will play at full quality
there will be no color
there is no color on this device
that is not why you're buying this device
this is for people that want
there is no refresh issues whatsoever
it's a 10.5 inch screen
that isn't e-ink it's lcd but it's not really lcd
meaning you get the best of all worlds
it has a 5 000 milliamp battery
this thing is going to last a long time
q5 rlcd 10.5 inch tablet
hello my cuties and welcome back
i hope you're all doing well so last video
i also have this gorgeous tablet
so i'll try to cover
so what i do instead
then i'll start the thumbnails now
thumbnails are messy and quick
i'll draw about six pages
then take a break come back to it later
it's time to sketch the actual pages
a good thing to do is sketch up
most of the chapter first so
but i'm aware it can get overwhelming and boring
depending on how many panels there are and the detail
because you're your own boss
they're extremely important to any comic
if you're using clip studio paint like i am
so don't do what i did
their speech bubbles for size ideas
nothing is more frustrating than reading
a comic and the speech bubbles are completely illegible
yes yes i got this
absolutely gorgeous tablet sent by artysm
it is the portability of it
i use a pretty big graphics
tablet or display tablet rather
it has 8192 levels of pen pressure
which honestly is just the cutest little thing
it also ready for this
i think it's i think it's really cute
and it's just it's just really pretty
that are like yo pax
where do i get a tablet
what do i do here you go
and you know yada yada so
i highly recommend this tablet
i don't believe it works on iphones
mac os systems as well as windows systems
so maybe they can work on that
just talk about tablets all the time
hey hey it's time to thank my patreons
thank you guys so much
you guys have been so patient with me
hello oh my gosh hi emma
we got our wonderful little blue moon
tees y'all are so cute
what is this a hundred dollar tier the galaxy
i i can't i yo yo what
you're so you're so kind to me
i can't i thank you so much
it was a wild month for me so again
hello Android users great news see
2 gigs of ram 16 gigs of ROM
and they're all sub $100 tablet
let's find out what's inside inside the box
we find a little foam
the tablet wrapped up in a lot of plastic
we'll peel that off a little later
underneath we find the various adapters
now this one came with
you can read it it's in English
my tablet actually arrived cracked in the bottom
right hand corner it was actually kind of cracked open
there's dual speakers which are okay not very loud
SD card all pretty generic
Play Store and your email on all that
e^x a custom launcher that
Doc's on the side make folders
it's quite handy to have now
then click on settings you'll note that
scroll all the way down
the tablet model number is actually called a V 11
that's the name of the tablet
it's a quad-core a 33 processor
another good feature of this tablet
is that it comes with the
I compared this directly to other devices
this tablet has a terrible painful to look at screen
you're gonna see the poor screen
quality is definitely the biggest downside to the tablet
and you'll feel like zombies
I mentioned only come with one gigs
so that's gonna run out eventually
I already ran into a problem
so basically you'll have to uninstall some apps
it can be a bit of a problem now
there's no way really to fix this
you'll see that these system storage in the internal storage
the deep sleep rating is around minus 30
ma which is half decent
scroll down and look for the security tab
the next step we're gonna go to the
Play Store and use the Dolphin Browser
I highly recommend getting this browser
it's one of the best
everything's in the video's description
of course just look down there
we swipe down from the left hand side
I've already downloaded it once
there doesn't take that long and I'll load it up
once the app starts for the first time
I've reached a hundred percent successfully
now we go to the main
King root app page and under root authorization
we are in root checker
or in this case we're gonna allow it
click allow and there we go
we verified our root status is functioning properly
the device is now rooted for any rooted apps
you want to try out enjoy it
you have any trouble with this particular
the user experience was ok that the screen was unacceptable
thanks for watching everybody you
you can put a sticker on your headphones for me
it's always gone because a kid always has my tablet
there's also things on my tablet that
I don't want my son to access my ten-year-old son
the first thing you're gonna see are these books
they loved these books especially in kindergarten grade
you can either have the tablet read to you
I don't let my ten-year-old watch standard YouTube
so that's on this tablet
there's lots of great choices
I've never really used Disney now
he can only download certain apps so
I can control what he's viewing
I have not broken the tablet
your tablet is smashed with this tablet
it has a very bouncy ball case
I mean I'm not even concerned about dropping it
I would drop in on the floor
the only thing I think I would change about
obviously it's not going to turn on
I find are a very useful feature
I had a child in kindergarten or a grade one
I would definitely bring home
this tablet the Disney pre-loaded content alone
I think is completely worth it
those are great books that they have in there
you're not going to break this
it's like a foam shell
it's always hard to do that
hello everybody gets past syllable and um
I'm a little upset usually when I'm drawing
it definitely works but it has a lot of problems
the tablet that I'm using is a helium 420
I don't know the actual pronunciation of it
it's very very very small
the thing about this is
the battery in is really flimsy
and so my pen is constantly falling apart
my third complaint is the wire
the wire itself is fine
it's an okay length but it's unresponsive
you're listening to actually comes through into your headphones
sometimes my fourth complaint is and
I used sigh and maybe I worded it wrong
I hope your days have been better than mine
I've got a quick opportunity to show you this
Windows 8 tablet from Fujitsu
Q 702 that I've shown you recently
it's got a 1366 by 768 display resolution
but you can see that
Q 572 actually has a removable battery
Q 572 only weighs 730 grams
I should say about the Q 572
this tablet is clear targeted at business users at corporate
on-site warranty which is quite unique for a tablet device
there's a couple of little lugs there that
HP that I've got here
the screens are actually glued together
and they're not really serviceable at all
there's actually a smart card reader here
here there is a standalone desktop
we've got a webcam and on the back
you'll see that this tablet here is
Windows 7 as well as Windows 8
but as you can see it does really well
Q 572 is really designed for corporate tablet deployment
kind of place that you might expect to see
but what do you know about them
bamboo cth 470 is a third-generation
they don't produce them anymore
there's a newer version of the
Wacom tablets you can pick these up on Amazon
usually used in rare cases there are new ones
alright let's talk about the hardware
the bamboo usually responds quickly
there's a chance you will lag
but that's because of Microsoft
the pen has two buttons on it
click whenever you press something
you can change how the pen tip feels
you can change tracking modes you can enable click
sounds or turn them off
you can change the double-click lengths
the smooth surface is where you use your pen
it has a 5.8 inch by three point
oh gee what do you need
larger pens and the pen is 6 inches
I did not have one with mine in total
alright everyone thanks for watching
I upload a video and sneak
peek it's going to be about this tripod thing
Bartholomew has for us today
okay we have the bamboo create pin and touch tablet
some fellow that let's check it out
here's the drawing pin along with some accessories
let's start with the pin
I just put those in there a second ago
I'm going to show you how that works right here
and yes you will go to pen tips
you don't need the tool for this part okay
that's the part that you actually draw in
also you can go to the
I waited for like five minutes
install it and it said oops
sure no pen goes perfect with that texture
so let's have a good texture to it
does it feel like paper
that's the actual drawing area now
I like what this tablet also
that's when you get action actual drawing on the screen
now you might be asking
you just click and drag
I'm doing right here by the way
I mean I will draw for you
this thing is just a trackpad to count like apples
trackpad is kind of like a touch pad
I mean that's pretty much it only only thing
thanks for watching starting at the top it says
Windows 10 look on tablets
Start screen all around now
you can also look at your application list
and that's of course the power button
now that's your back button that is of course
Cortana and that is the next button
there is your task view
if you will now the one thing you notice
is that at the bottom
there is really nothing all those icons
I had that were pin there
now you can also go in the action
Notification Center to actually switch between tablet mode
I can quickly access applications
I use all the time like you know
I can now decide how I want to multitask
it's a fluid process and it works
well one of the things
you can see using the task view
you can still pin all the applications
you were running on there now with this
I have a full desktop
look again so I can
hey guys welcome back to my channel in this video
with a 10 inch display
it's probably the best deal around at the moment
it's pretty impressive for a entry-level product
so here is the tablet itself
yeah for a entry level tablet
yeah and yeah it does feel pretty well built this
okay right here we have
here is the free belief
I don't know what it called
is this free free stand or something
I believe these are hit things earphones
so yeah so yeah a bunch of cheap earphones
the viewing angles are great
this tablet is pretty loud
they are and in fact
I feel especially the louder
you go the more distortion there is so now
so let's see what what scores is getting okay
you know surfing websites and checking their Facebook and yeah
it's basically made for a simple task
it's not as good as the mid-range smartphones that
the output is reasonably good
the leap pattern has a double
you just need to pry open this plastic cover here
that concludes my review of the illegally pad 10
I'll see you again good bye
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
nobody is paying for this review
nor is anyone reviewing or approving
what you're about to see before it was uploaded
they both have an 8-inch display
it's a 1280 by 800 display
that's a 64-bit processor to get a little techie
Amazon change their mind in the future
Qi like I do here
I'm finding it's hard sometimes to get the center
point exactly dialed in there
there is an accessory item that
industrial design leads you to believe
you'll hear it out of both audio quality isn't spectacular
which is how my phone is configured
it's going to be here
your power button is here
you've got a volume rocker here
and you've got a headphone jack and again
then you've got another camera here on the back
both cameras are 2 megapixels not spectacular image quality
they have it protected underneath this little door here
we might see a different ad popping up here
let's take a look now at performance
they're 10 inch tablet is still the best performing
Amazon tablet that they have in their lineup
that one costs a little bit
that's a pretty good deal
I think and for games and stuff
this will do just fine
let me show you where the added
RAM might make a difference
let's go to the main menu and load up maybe
we might see that load screen pop up briefly
it didn't bring us back to the main menu
RAM to keep both apps running in the background
it's pretty easy to again
read text on here and as you can see
I checked out one of Alex
Lindsay's office our webinars that he runs in zoom
every morning he's a big-time video production
just fine the audio was good
the video seemed to work
all work well on here as well
either because again it doesn't have those official
we're going to explore that in an upcoming video
even when they are in standby mode
this was a feature that was in the prior
I'm getting a visual representation of that response
that wasn't available at the time
I was shooting this video
this works though with our other charger here
down on that wireless charger
I was recording this video
this channel was brought to you by the lon
TV supporters including gold level supporters
the four guys with quarters podcasts
Tom Albrecht Rick vestido Chris Allegretto in Cali an Kumar
I ma'am I don't think I can do this
hmm how the do people do this seriously
oh man ah okay ah no
I have to take extra measures
I have to go and pray
they upload cookies e im a skrub
this mouse cannot the wall
I can only trust you
please give me the skill required for this game
please give me some baby so
I have to give it to you
I'm doing this for you cook easy
what do we have here
I need to open it somehow
ok this is going to take a while
ah this is harder than image material
oh boy what we have here
thank you guys for watching and see you next time
let's see we have old space
yeah this looks a little different though
some of us are drag players like myself
many people would be like oh man
I didn't need this new tablet
it acts almost the same as any other tablet
it has a solid surface
I think this tablet is made for you
I mean its budget its $40 links in the description
so it's pretty good until about a tablet
I haven't tested it out but I should
well let's look inside manual whoo
yeah we have all these information here
the idea is pretty unique
I think it's made for us
because because the resolution is is much like the playfield
yeah let's let's let's look inside this
let's see what we have here
your mother's piece of goddamnit piece of burn you burn
yes yes yes oh so good
oh yes we have a new
some kind of interesting shape
I mean it's it's like mutt anyway
what can you put oh
yes you can plug inside here
you can eat it as we have some pen nibs
a laptop isn't coming with it
nowadays you just download it from the internet from YouTube
yeah subscribe to go to
how to assemble and disassemble the pan
mmm what a good and let's try this out so
oh it's on its down
is the batter the end
oh what's what what's this what's this
is this a love message
that can be nobody there is no point
it's all thank you for the coat
I'll pay all these things with the table
I couldn't pick a mouse
carry the table only table
yeah it's not working this
this tablet is the key to being a pro
look at this rhythm skill
what you cannot have it with this tablet
yes hmm oh look at this
let's see maybe not 800 PP
I'm a sellout deal with it
hello guys and welcome back to my channel
today's video is something super super excited today
I'm going to be doing a review
I am so freaking excited to try this out
use them at the moment
I'm looking at my screen
this also wants for 300 so it's considerably considerably cheaper
let's go into this page shall we
please peel off mask before use
so this is how it's packaged
this is in download driver
then what's this interesting pin display
obviously we've got the tablet
I can't wait to try this out
Wacom pen as you can see
the style is very very similar
I like how sturdy that is so
here my lead is for your monitor
I ordered the wrong adapter
I needed the USB to see
I finally got it working
it's been a long time coin
let's see if it works shall we so
we are ready to go
I've kept it set up to the 27 inch display
it's a solid like pen
it's not as jittery so my
oh that this is very smooth
I can't draw straight lines anyway
so this seems oh very smooth
I say by going into this one
I'm just going to increase the pen size
I don't know what does I do
I'm kind of like leave it
that kind of works the best
I really like that so far the pressure sensitivity
it's very very nice like it
it's my screen display black nose
see how you get with it and obviously
yeah you works so now
I can just click this for my pen
I can click this button and it'll open my brush
let's see if this works so
I have set it off which is obviously undo
this should undo my stuff
I put the wrong come under my dad
this should work this time yay so
I can literally just work like this one day
I'll have set up as your Sharp keys for Photoshop
you can put them in to this
I've got my hotkeys sorted out
little doodle giving human tablet a little tryout and and
Photoshop has a lot of tools and accessories around
then it might be the tablet for you
so do your research on that
I'm not clued off of our stuff like that
why am i doing a review video then
Pro is that the pen is beautiful
I can't fault the pen at all
I really like the ship
and it's nice that the buttons are here
I also like the way
I really really liked that
I liked that I have no complaints about it
I haven't used it for very long
I can't say how hot it's gonna get Booker
is this little door not pen
hold the door not saying that
yeah it's very nice quality and it looks cute
put your pen in so
I like that as well
you can't run full version Photoshop
at least you couldn't until the new
there's another 100 on top of your already expensive purchase
so if you're not sure what to get
Photoshop but you have to plug it into your computer
obviously this human is not portable in terms of
it's a definite improvement from my old
I hope this was helpful to you all
thank you so so much for watching
thank you and for gifting me
I love you so so much guys
alright then love you bye
it has a um a windows
hello infrared camera as part of the webcam here
it has a little red flashing light
is that um all of the usbc points
the charger plugged in as well
the stock varies from time to time
unfortunately it's not what i want
but it doesn't just stop there
this one has seven gigabytes
there's hundreds of templates on there for you to use
take care and i'll see in the next one
we have a product to review a sim bans
I know you guys are out there
some of you just want in the bottom line
it'll jump you right to the conclusion otherwise stick around
let's take a look at this
I have literally not open
this box have not seen this
they sent me one would
I take a look at it and do a video
I said sure send it along
firstly it does come with a UK
and your plug in adapters
you will need to use batteries with the pun
it uses quadruple a batteries
you can see that size difference there
the resolution wasn't as high as you want
somebody's wedding or like your kids
birthday party just get a better camera
it's a little too much up up right
so it's not a big loss there anyway
I used the pencil tool here
like you know the oil paint brushes
somebody's driving you're just sitting there
are you gonna sketch away
I do like I believe
the cameras got a cutout for that as well
it's going to do that for you

can you hear foreign so yeah
also the working surface data
trust me foreign by the way
what do i think about this last time
i would give it like till then
gasps you love from people you trust
let's wrap things up with our very own producer
is the budget tablet owner
which is the budget awright
cuz we have more r a minute or exactly
yeah so it has some a few better interiors
you get a little bit faster prom
I of course has the volume ports on the side
I never did that myself
so didn't become a problem for me now
one interesting thing about the micro
I wouldn't say it's great
they have adobe audio and two different speakers on here
so you get dual audio
just a couple of short seconds on here
I have Radford's review of the 925
I'll turn this up for you
it's nice and clear it gets loud too
sounds good i mean you can
i can't tell it home but it sounds pretty good
i could do it for audiobooks
it would be fine for watching youtube videos
I gotta skip this out
I'll play some music that we won't get taken
there's no babe my friend
Dale chase there is no bass
and it's very clear and crisp
which was just released recently
so it's pretty brand-new well
you're thinking to have a lighter
version of jelly before 22 is pretty common
yeah yeah 4.2 is really nice but 4.1
so definitely a little old
I'll save the display for last
I did want to mention on the front facing camera
you get this little camera
I'll pull up some pictures that I took
they actually don't look that great
so here's a couple of pictures
it is 0 point three megapixel
that's the front facing front facing
I guess or definitely is yeah
it's all know so when it freezes now again okay
you go happens quite a bit
I don't think you need to go much further
the display is 1024 x 600
ooh the resolution is really really low
Morgan Ewing angles even turning 20
you can outdated software a really bad camera on that
take a look at that
yeah yeah so it was just
I really didn't like that
yeah which is so too bad no by trying so
don't buy i would say you know
Nexus haven't quite a bit
i think that there are good choices out there
Dolby puts his name on something

if you took away the touch id button
you have an expandable storage sd card reader
that can read up to 128 gigs of expandable storage
on the bottom you have dual speakers
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and then a usb type
is this heavy at all
it gets nice and bright
the colors seem very accurate
text is easy to read
they have this anti-blue light screen that they call it
the back camera can shoot in 720p
the front-facing camera can only shoot in 480p
you can expand that with an sd card
this one just feels so much more snappier
they also seem to open up faster as well
life has also been really impressive they quote 12 hours
consumption has been really impressive as well
i'm pretty impressed with this fast

this 8 inch tablet is premium

Let’s look at what’s inside
Inside the box we find the tablet Itself
A pen with a same felt pouch
A micro-usb cable to connect tablet to computer
This is how a full set looks like
and now let’s test this tablet
It's easy to shift modes in driver
Working area is 24 by 16 centimeters
With 8192 high levels pressure sensitivity
you can make more smooth and natural line
The back of the tablet has four rubber feet
so the tablet doesn't slip when you use it
There is also a jacket for holding a pen
you can easily replace it
The user manual contains information
A good thing that it takes only about a minute
I like that the lines are smooth
It also depends on the settings you apply
I really enjoy to use it in drawing
I hope that you enjoyed this video
hi guys welcome to the start of another studio vlog
it's been it's been a been a couple of weeks
because that's better but i like sitting here

i feel ready to go
um but yeah that's why there was
today is like any typical monday
i think i did four orders
um i've got my zoom calls
um i have a whole website page to build
um so i've got that to do
i don't get these often
i have been sent some new earphones now
um because i hadn't seen anybody else share them
um and i do love them
they're wonderful like on an airplane
i have been looking into them
some of them are so expensive though
i thought this is wonderful
adaptive dual microphone technology filters out unwanted background noise
how do i get there
how do i get into it
okay so it has this little
oh this is so nice so you put them out
oh right i'll tell you what
owner's manual so activate bluetooth on your device
this is a right one

i don't think that is bad at all
aren't they like crazy expensive 69 pounds
very nothing gonna stop me now
um so the headphones are 69 pounds
i'm gonna be using them today
um but first impressions are i think
um i've got nothing valuable to say
um just the usual doubt in myself really
um but what's great about these zoom calls is
should i say on charge
um the wire is very short on the charging cable
i'm just gonna try to not die of shame
so yeah i will go and do this
okay first zoom call of the day is done
so um i'm thrilled with them
right let me put them back in their case
i need to get into the habit of doing that
let's see what my table is

i'm gonna eat some food
it's a day off for me tomorrow
thank you so much for watching
i will see you very soon
hey yo what's up and happy 2021.
it's shortcake and i've been getting a lot of questions
i won't have too much of a struggle
this here is shortcake and she has a new redesign
basically what quarantine does to our hair from staying
i made a whole storyboard for an entire animation
you think i got time for that
i lower the opacity of it
1 poop 2 poop 3 and so forth
i'm not the best at it
it's a pretty easy process
because now it's time to review the gaomon m10k 2018
but it's very tiny and in a square shape
this one has 10 customizable keys
iv present buttons here and there
it's really convenient honestly physically
this tablet is light but also very sturdy
i just put my stylus in the tag
i made pretty cool right
you'll see that the promo is applied
i just recently launched my patreon page
okay see ya beautiful you
it's a package from chiana time
hey guys welcome back to the channel
because it's the third tablet i bought
it's basic explanation about tablet
how you need to set it up okay
so we're having the power
another thing is and there can be construction area
how bad the quality of the camera is so
i did some quick recording outside
of course you can also use the bluetooth capabilities
okay so i'm giving quick demonstration
let's boot up cpu zed
i could install it this time with the 2020 model
finally i could do this
having the androids x20 is the board
and let's see mediatek mt 6000 version
and let's see with the display
here you can see the first difference
the same goes for the ram
it's a lie so that is fake
this is just a fact but the question remains
that does not really have a very bad playback
so let's try a youtube
yeah i know for people familiar to my channel
let's try and racing game
but don't get me wrong
that is running on the backhand
so let's take a close look
how good is the response
we're going to have a look at the me berry
m6 dual sim quad core
nothing else much on the box
i've put in there to test out with it later
so you get a bluetooth keyboard
i'll have a look at that shortly
i'll try that on the tablet a little bit later
you get the screen protector
it's got a little flash on there
the front camera is 5 megapixels
the display quite fingerprint heavy norm
you can see on the bottom there
nothing else on the top
just put that to one side
there user manual cleaning cloth
i believe clean the cloth there get rid of them
fingerprints got your usbc charge
nice little added feature there a little stylus
i move the box out though
see a nice bright display my app drawer underneath there
so it is compatible with the google play store
that comes pre-loaded on there
so this will connect to your wi-fi by via 2.4
g got some apps there
it's performance wise pretty good
so we'll work with simple games like roblox
all we'll have a quick look at the settings
i have downloaded a few apps
which is really good system
it picks up the the local area
so go ahead and try the case on there
say that fits in really nice
there folds down got the bluetooth keyboard
let's have a look quick
dual sim 10 inch tablet
i'll see you next time you
hi Abby here something a little different this video
I'm going to do a review for a tablet
I'm reviewing today is the Galman 10 display pd-1 161
so how'd it perform after playing with it
I'm not the best drawer
Amanda I love the comic so much
to the tablet review it retails at around 180 pounds
usually a display tablet is over 250 pounds
it came well packaged and the setup was very simple
basically plug in and play
you have more buttons to adjust the screen settings
it is a bit thin and small display wise
I didn't have any issues with the pen
and it has extra knobs in the holder
I'd give this tablet a good 7 out of 10
the waist is good it builds light
and it's easier setup and a big chunky slide tablet
the quality of the screen is good
the screen dimensions seem a little weird
I'd say it's just as good I'm much cheaper
I'm sorry I didn't do a better drawer for this
I hope you're all staying safe in his blue attire
and you're looking forward to my animations
I'm finally doing a tablet review
okay so as you may have noticed
this isn't exactly the normal type of video
I needed a new tablet
like bad man my old
it all off you know like one where
I'm grateful that they supplied me with a new tablet
but that of course doesn't mean that
I'm gonna give them preferential treatment either
I haven't been paid for this review
what are you getting out of the box
oh god both of them hurt so much
just plug the wires into their appropriate ports and bam
but even that's pretty easy
thankfully the pen itself doesn't run on separate power
I run into this with other tablets
so that's pretty nice the only thing
I'm not a huge fan
it's pretty damn nice to use
this package goes for about 184 dollars on Amazon
I'd like to say so
who wants to get into tablets
I think that makes sense okay
well that about wraps things up
I didn't write an outro for this video
this is not a tutorial
and then we're gonna have another video
I use these together so first of all
I want to talk about the stylus
we usually last me about three weeks
insert it in the end
I wanted to demonstrate that to you
this is a pretty cool feature
this is pretty cool alright
version 2.0 is an upgrade over version
1.8 as to how the home screen is laid out
the folders are all laid out across the top
so here's my Matterhorn folder
all you do is just touch on the folder
it pulls up that folder
now you can see here across the top
you can add a new folder within that folder
a notebook and quick sheets
and let me just show you how
and what makes it so spiffy
scroll back with client information
I do the same thing
I really like the highlighter function
so if there's something in on this page that
I want to easily be able to find
I can take the highlighter and I can write here
I can see at a glance this date
and there's something highlighted here
I forget to do something
I'm supposed to call Joe so for me
the highlighter function is very important
it gives me my folders across the top
what was a conversation about so this helps me
keep all of my activities and thoughts organized
okay here's another feature that
I can take this file
I'm ready to send her my edits
I think this is pretty amazing
this really really makes my life so much easier
i hit send by email
this is pretty priceless where
let's say last year it was six hundred thousand
their materials and subs were two hundred thousand
and there's an erase feature
I think this is pretty amazing
it gives me a blank piece of paper
I can jot down all of my notes
but it's in the wrong place
it's like a sticky note
here's what's really cool is
I can send this to the proper folder
I can make a duplicate of that
I want to move it out to all right
it's a huge upgrade from 1.8
it keeps all my different activities organized
I hope this has been helpful
so uh uh is together together come on another
i guess i could take the subway
get real high and fun days
real laid back like sunday
i guess i can't complain
everybody needs some cause everybody needs some love
I'm Nathan with the e-book reader comm for this video
it's among the latest lineup of new tablets from Amazon
there's just the size difference with the screen
so let's go ahead and talk about the hardware first
it's a 8 inch tablet
and this one's actually quite nice
it's got a really nice rigid
feel to it feels very solid
we've got the camera up here in the top corner
it's got like more of a premium
feel to a lot thinner
I'm impressed with the screen
it does have really nice
it only has the 1280 by 800 screen
the screen actually looks quite nice
it kind of minds me of
it kind of reminds me of those so
I do like it a lot
have this bar up here
these ones are installed from the Amazon store
we get the different font choices
book early is the new default
we've got these on the list here options
we've got different color options
I see things going as I think look tablet
I forgot to mention it earlier
it has two speakers on the top edge right here
and that's all so they project out quite well
they don't get muffled easily tone
Island as far as the volume is concerned
well gentlemen continue the captain
I don't know who has this map
it's all your books downloaded
it's also got the wikipedia entry down here
you can get translations where that works
is you just type in select a different language
which is kind of interesting
everything's nice and bright and clear
it's got good strong viewing angles
it does look quite good so comics illustrate the what
I'm saying about the screen very well
it actually looks quite good when you have it
just not quite as nice
some of the other tablets out there
it actually seems to work good
I don't have any issues with touch screen
I don't have any issues with it
YouTube video plays so yeah
check out the e-book reader comm for some additional information
I post how-to guides and like free
they may seem quite good there
it's kind of an older one so
it's about 100 pounds on Amazon
it's got a battery feel free pen now
well that's a bit awkward
that's oh yeah the model is an inspiration
Kay version 2 version 2 is important
plan the nearest doctor parking
you're welcome what was he
we'll see if you're welcome if we like the tablet
the tablet itself comes in a nice nice packet
it's kind of a nice feel to it
it's got some buttons down the side
then what the ones in the
I'm just too used to the the shortcuts in Photoshop
the things to point out are the on the end
I tend to do sure you keep the wiring
it's a little lock on it
I guess we'll find out what that's not
it's yeah it's about the size of the into us
Wacom which is a tiny little bamboo thing
I assume that these containing yes the nibs
that's good you can show you that
I have never broken the nitwit touch wood touch wood
I know a lot of you wear them down
it's not too light not too heavy
this one looks a lot more like the
maybe that people who are used to using a paintbrush
yeah it feels quite nice
so that's a good thing it's got two buttons
I didn't use them very much
I don't as far as I can tell okay
let's see how well it sits in here
I guess how much space you've got on your desk
just pop those back in other things we've got
there's a download driver manual
it seems like a good idea so
it's good it's reasonable quality
it's er it's nice eh
I've been using Photoshop Elements with it
you can configure that in
Supra have the same thing
absolutely no problems with that
it wasn't able to do that and concentrate
but yes there's no no no lag while
do you think it's ever so slightly lighter than the
this tablet and pen don't have that
so that's that's probably one one down tick verses
I'm really happy with it
I'm really happy that it
it's it's a really nice feeling size
I had where it would know
I needed to get a specific version of the driver
who knows if future drivers will have problems
I've got absolutely no complaints
it was a joy to use so
very many places can attend to how
the the presentation is really nice
the you know it comes in a really nice box
it feels well packaged and like
it's it'll have been safe in transit
you know really good like
I say I would have
it could have been it could have felt bit sturdier
but it's that's a you know quite a minor thing
usability of the tablet again with the with the connectivity
I get they seem to be getting you know
the drivers feel more professional
the products are definitely improving over time
Wacom stop and range I personally
Wacom one I'll go for the three to four hundred
yeah this brand is actually
they're not bad at all
I'd probably give her an eight out of ten
I think it was an Amazon
so yeah thanks for listening
I'm watching hope you enjoyed my terrible creatures
but yeah thanks for watching guys see you later

Android tablet that has a HD IPS screen
it also has a quad-core processor
we highly recommend the matric kanji
Android tablet here is the chromo 7-inch Android tablet

which has a poor camera
but it's the cheapest tablet on our list
but you get an expandable microSD card slot

nothing too fancy on the latching mechanism here either
computer actually feels pretty good
free for software installation on here
there is a card slot
it are pretty good actually
it's not too bad on the viewing angle side
the display quality is okay
it's not going to be as good as more expensive
I do like the keyboard quite a bit
I've seen on department-store tablets for sure
there is a passable trackpad on here
is that if you click right in the middle
the little power standby switches right here
I got that HDMI port that we talked about
it might be a little bit slower than the storage
erase the tablet but it does actually reset the tablet
there is a camera on the back in the front
let's take a look at my youtube channel
our screen is loading up right now
this feels about the same as other
we're not having any lag at all
but you get the idea
things like stream games from other devices in the home
I was pleased to see
is that the warranty on
this is a year versus 90 days that
I have looked at recently
so that is a good thing
this is LAN size and thanks for watching
I did get this tablet for free
I requested that I be able to be honest
that's really cheap but yeah let's get started
see see what we're getting ourselves into
looks like it's packaged pretty nicely
it doesn't weigh hardly anything
nice it's in clear plastic film
there's still a lot more box to go through
I did not expect that
Wacom tablet did not come with a stand
that's an extra charge so good on you
XP pen that's that's awesome and it feels alright
it feels like decent enough plastic
I'll have to mess with that in a bit
I'm not sure how it pops out
I assume it just covers manufacturer defects
thank you for choosing to support XP tablets
I get asked about my smudge guard a lot
these gloves can be super useful
it doesn't feel super cheap
you can see that which is cool
it's nice that it comes with extra pen
nibs unscrew that here see
there's your pen nibs right there
it's a very light plastic
it's definitely a comfortable shape pen
you know they don't feel mushy or anything
I'd have to say pretty cool
so let's put that back in
this thing is super light
but let's take off this plastic there
we go peel all that off
uh everybody's favorite part about new electronics the P Alize
oh okay so now that we've done our unboxing
let's install the thing so
I don't know how I feel about that stand
I might suggest getting a different stand for you
um let's see okay so on my laptop
it says it has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity
that's a function that usually only
I'll be excited to try that out
see how that feels and like
the pen doesn't use a battery
you don't have to charge it
which again is something that
I thought only Wacom would have which that's really cool
usually these shortcut keys um
I almost never use even on my tablet
but we'll play around with them
we'll see how they go
and yeah overall the look of the tablet itself
it looks like a good piece of construction
that's on my computer laptop computer laptop
so there's a power button right here
it just does it automatically all right moment of truth
how's the um how's the pen respond
it seems like it's following pretty accurately
the screen itself feels nice
it's not slippery like glass or anything
it's got a little bit of a matte
that would be useful to talk about
this pen doesn't have an eraser typically with
I would use a hot key or something so yeah
I'm starting up a clip studio paint
which is my favorite drawing program
I have to say like first impressions using this thing
it looks awesome like the display
it's not too bright and it's not too dim
I'm not a huge color expert
so here's the big test
would you look at that
it works right off the bat
I probably spent two to three hours
getting that thing to work just uninstalling drivers reinstalling it
this was really easy to install
I'm super stoked about that
so yeah let's uh open up the driver
Oh you can also have it
do open tablet settings find detail mode
I'm not sure what that does
it's it's not smooth and I actually like that
oh that's kind of cool if I press it again
I'm very impressed with the driver on this tablet
so let's set that to middle click is what
I usually set my second mouse
button - this one's on right click
I right-click in the corner here
yeah wow it's already calibrated
it looks so good display settings
please set your monitors to extend mode
okay so what this means is right
so that's pretty cool now
the pen doesn't seem to be working anymore
what's going on with that
but that's cool that you can customize that
sometimes that can make a difference express key settings
the second one is alt
the third one is space so space
it's um now it's my brush size
is that what that means
I see so the klk our function
advance one frame turn it left
that's everything in the driver overall
I'm very happy with that
it's got everything that the
it's not super smooth to draw on but nothing
it's a bit sticky parallax wise
it feels pretty on the nose
I'm having no problem whatsoever
it's not liking at all
yeah dang XP pen I love this thing
I pay 250 dollars for this absolutely yeah
I wish this was a self-contained unit but it's not
your computer doesn't have to be super close
what happens if I shut the screen on my laptop
I want to test the tilt function
okay check that out the
it's not drawing at all oh
it seems to work from a certain angle
most of these off-brand tablets don't have a tilt function
I think that's gonna do it
you know time would tell so far
I have no issues with it
but yeah the rotation thing is nice
it doesn't really have any heft to it
I don't think it's that fragile
and you know when you're drawing on the screen
it's not the best feeling
I immediately know I'm not gonna like this
it's getting a lot of bubbles and stuff
I wasn't very careful about putting it on
it looks bad honestly drawing on it
that actually feels worse yeah
I probably wouldn't put the screen protector on
I really like this tablet a lot
it was super easy to draw on
the drawing surface is a bit gummy
it doesn't feel like paper or glass
it's a bit kind of sticky
the stand that comes with is very unstable
I would recommend getting a different stand for it
thank you for listening to my tablet review and
I'll catch you guys next time
- Thanks for joining me.
(funky music) (scribbling) (paper ripping) (paper crumpling)
The Parblo Mast 22 is a display tablet
you can draw on with a pressure-sensitive pen.
The pen supports over 8,000 pressure levels.
That makes this a great tablet for large-gesture drawing.
don't go near the edge of the screen.
It's actually already peeling off.
My Spider5 colorimeter measured Adobe RGB at 79%.
Other display tablets have a control panel
that can be repositioned on-screen.
Now let's discuss the pen.
Pen pressure on the Mast
It's easy to get light pressure.
The transitions and the line within opacity are even.
So that just about sums up the pen.
Let's move to the exterior of the device.
The cable connections are a little bit weak.
and the driver does not offer on-screen keys.
UI doesn't take up too much of the screen.
The control panel has very limited options.
I don't see a way to disable that.
Now let's talk about the stand.
(funky music) All right. So now for my conclusion.
some more of my drawing tablet reviews.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
i just watched a video
i was inspired by brett from oz tablet review
so i'm going to show you his youtube page here
i have an iphone 11 pro iphone
let's go ahead and open this up right here
the install is very very simple and it's very small
you're going to click start
a tablet stand or whatever
i'm looking at the back side of my camera
the back side of my phone
droid cam is recording me
it's easy to feel alone
sometimes we're going to mute okay
so let's pretend i'm talking to brett
hi i like your computer
whisper shirt actually is pretty cool
i like seeing brett's legs
i can watch the screen if i want again
that's most comfortable for my camera
setup all right you guys that's it
if you have a windows
10 tablet and a stylus subscribe to this channel
it is made for you until next time
stay creative and have a wonderful day
this is the new Cintiq 16
it's a new budget price display from
it is a pen display basically
it's an external monitor that connects to your computer
notice here the lack of the word
Wacom is doing here is
sometimes taking something away can be a bad thing
well let's take a look at the
the biggest difference here is the screen itself
and so you're gonna get a crisper image
the pro also has a laminated display
this screen is a film on the pros
that's available now at the time that
I'm doing this review currently pretty much
has these same exact specifications
Wacom is my personal gold standard
it really feels natural slow angled lines
it's it's exactly the way
the pressure curve feels very natural in the illustration
I'm doing in the background when I'm coloring in
I'm using a really wide brush
I increase the size of that brush
I use a lot but this stylus has tilt support
you can tilt the pen this way
you could tilt the pen that way
that's fairly rare in many other third-party devices in fact
I've set it in other videos
the color spectrum listed here is 72%
accuracy have one monitor calibrated to be super accurate
and then they're using something else to draw on anyway
this is all to say
I'm really bad at judging color
II I think the colors look fine
there is a stand that
Wacom has on its website available for about $80
it attaches to the back of the display
this comes with a combo cable
there's nothing in the in the box
there is other stuff in the box
I'm looking in the Box now
oh look there are extra nibs
there tucked away behind this little
how did I miss that now one thing
I do want to talk about a little bit
that folks were having problems with drivers
it was super easy to setup
so let's talk a little bit about pros and cons
the pros definitely go with the pen
Cintiq price ever the cons
I think it's a pretty good step
I'm a big fan of it
I think it works well
hello everyone in this week's video
this video is going to be different than my usual
i draw your oc videos
think of it as in
i draw your oc mini
let's take a look at the tablet
so this is the week vk 1200.
it does have a screen
nibs and there are more pen
nibs hiding with the pen stand
the screen is fully laminated
we have six customizable express keys and on the right
we have the spots for the cords to plug in
i do think it'd be nice
i got from a previous tablet
so next was setting up the tablet which went smoothly
i do want to mention that
they say you can use a standard phone charger
my laptop plugged in while using the tablet
i hope i'm saying it right
it's just a simple three-quarter bust drawing like i mentioned
this is kind of a i
there were a ton of gotcha character
and that's how i got this character
the monitor did help a lot with the mouse cursor
this is a common thing for tablets to do
i use does the same thing
i made these really strong at first
and then i toned it down
i feel like this gave the hair a really neat
look so this tablet is nice to work on
sensitivity works very well and responds nicely
they didn't give me any issues
thankfully i also like how
the tablet doesn't take up very much space
it doesn't take up my entire desk
it just takes up a little portion of it
the film applied to the screen is also really nice
vk 1200 is 249.99 on amazon
i think this is a really reasonable price
so that makes it so
the tablet is much more portable
4.5 out of 5 stars the reason
i'm not giving it a full
he was a lot of fun to draw
so let's check it out
Windows or on a Mac
these drawing tablets come in two sizes small and medium
I use the small version
the small felt a little cramped at times
Hey look at this there shortcut keys along the top
you can map these to any keyboard shortcut
your heart desires having the keys along
no problem because it's been in light
it's super easy to take with you
but it's got these little rubber grippy
I use it for a few hours at a time
a lot of tablets say hey it feels like paper
this feels nothing like paper
Intuos line when we're talking about digital drawing
it's the perfect amount of texture
not too much not too little
let's take a look at this pen
it's got four thousand levels of pressure sensitivity
well it has a good initial activation rate apply
the pen fits snugly into the little loop
that's at the top of the tablet
I got used to it but I still think
I didn't run into any problems at all
I also liked the settings in their software
I have a dual monitor setup
I use the tablet on both screens as a mouse
replacement if your pen is mapped to both screens
flash animate whatever that program is called now huge time-saver
it's probably one of those things
so what are the drawbacks of the new intros
I haven't really run into that problem
so nothing huge and it also looks like
feel when you draw on the tablet
you're paying for those better drivers as far as price
this gets a little confusing so
I'll try to sort it out here
you can choose two of these three programs
the medium version comes with all three
if you're drawing comics or manga or a line art
let me know down below in the comment section
we'll see kind of on the edge of that one
I'll see you guys in a couple of days
guys it is 10.18 and it is big
welcome to the little brothers channel
today i have some prize for you guys
do you know what the surprise is i
can you guess it what the surprise is
if you can't guess it let me show you
what the surprise is well
where did i put this
aha the surprise is the g tab
look it is pretty 2000
gta p p 2 000 wi-fi table guys
now i will tell you the g tab
2000 p 2000 wi-fi tablet
wow cool flash memory 16 gb camera 2.0
mp guys now i will tell you
this battery is 5000 megahertz
look and power input 5v
let's open it and see what's inside
wow let me open it
there's a tablet and a pen
and also the quick start guide of g tag
that's the wall it is opening
wow let's see it is also you guys look
this is my best friend muslim and this is me
this is the play games play store
calendar sound recorder chrome clock camera
restaurant game fundraiser 3d race car flying gummy bear guys
five two guys look shadow
i have defeated him so much
with good value put into the product
Fire HD 10 and has a rubber bumper
that's pretty important with children
you can get a replacement
so it's recommended for slightly older children
it comes with a 10.1
that provides amazing viewing angles and bright colors
it's a pretty good display for watching
it has front and back camera
VGA and 2 megapixel respectively
being a solid camera for children to interact with battery
this is a pretty safe choice
not not not great not iPad quality or Samsung quality
this is the same as the
Augen 10 Touch 78 these are the same exact body
what's on the outside of the device
this is a host and on the go
I did try keyboard and mouse with and they
so that's kind of nice
that was something that was promised on the
they both had both have
SD card mini SD card up to 16 gigabyte
but this has a one gigahertz processor
let's go over kind of the
it does come with kind of a little overlay here
button shows your Wi-Fi your battery your time
there is a little camera
what you think would mean
I don't really find a need for that
it's kind of a weird feature to have
what you have to actually do
YouTube file manager settings and Wi-Fi settings
that's how you'll use this browser
it's relatively speedy you know it's the typical 2.1
you know two point two
obviously it would be faster with the improvements
they made there possibly could be an update
the question for most people is
I don't think it's horrible
there and the reboot is not saving
you can obviously sideload apps if you know anything about
you can try sideloading some of your apps on here
I'm just some video here this is Buck Bunny
this is 720p actually runs
pretty good looks pretty nice
so that's not really a big issue
the speaker doesn't have the greatest of sound headphones
have probably sound a lot better
I could see maybe for you know a younger child
you know for 139 this is a great little
Android device to give them that
you're not spending too much money
know $5.99 so you can go back
this is the media center
there's a you know to listen to music
hopefully that will be fine but with a firmware that
things are not going well so hopefully
before we get into the video man
I hope this video helped you
y'all make up your mind about buying it
I'll write with it if you write with it
let's do it if you don't that's cool
I don't say I'm big
so let's get onto the review
they do it gonna get
looks a little small little four-inch screen
it was sitting out right here

I see you for wallpaper
I just put this right here
yeah yeah custom to this with the
Google quit tab right here to iTunes
I use show box from time to time
I love the tablet like I said
I think I need to update it
if you want to see the unboxing
this entire speed painting was created with this
Huyen tablet while doing these sketches
I made a list of pros and cons
so we're gonna start out with the pros
this tablet has a ton of customizable buttons
there are so many buttons that
tool undo redo and flip canvas
those are the things that I use the most
a drawing surface on this tablet is huge
I was super surprised to see that
this tablet is 8100 - which is great
it felt very natural with that level of pin pressure
almost like you are using a pencil you can use
this tablet wired or wirelessly is really nice
did they not include it
where it shows you if your
the price is insanely good
I was surprised to look up
the retail value of this tablet and it is 159
US dollars which is crazy
tablets are expensive compared to other tablets
like that's a wonderful price
I tried to find a comparable
is this one but the closest one
this isn't too big of an inconvenience since you can
it's really not a super big deal
I do not have to charge the pin
I guess the technology is different
but it's just one thing
you know go back to the old way that
it's almost like playing an instrument the way
I put my left hand on the tablet
time's that being said had
this would be an amazing option for me
the pros absolutely outweigh the cons
I highly recommend this option and for the price
you really cannot beat it
Huyen tablet if you found this review helpful
please leave a like and subscribe to the channel
let's get right to it so today
it's comes in this foam piece right here
that has this type of connection on the front
we got a badly pre-installed screen protector
so let's go ahead and take it off
ouch but not only that it's a screen protector
that is pretty easy to scratch up so once again
now yes the tablet does have some pretty thick bezels
it faces you very well no overall
I think it works pretty well
and on the right side you'll find a full-size
USB port a micro HDMI port and the charging port
on to the left side we got the volume rockers
and that's all you get for this tablet
oh they're having to do some finger
the spacing on their hand is a bit too tight
here's what it sounds like
and here are these speeds
three speeds are pretty okay for an EMC storage
it does boot up things to launch pretty quickly
it's actually a single band
2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi networks so to put it simply
we don't have five gigahertz
of course it's 2.4 gigahertz
it's gonna be a huge bottleneck
we can say that it is running
and we are finally online now
it may disconnect at any point
I'm not too sure so
Rhyno burning at 720p lowest settings
if you're doing competitive gaming
it's gonna run terribly like 12 of PS
I've tried it just some old games
half-life game source games and retro games
and what do you know the
nothing is going through so so
yep depending on what you connect to these
so now we're are running at 4k and anything below
maybe you can get an
Ethernet cable and we'll talk about
what is the best alternative to this thing right here
now taking a quick look back at the display here
that's some very severe back
land bleed now speaking of the display here
we can actually use a stylus pen
and should you get it
it does look pretty nice
which is a good thing
it's not a whole lot
and it's actually very minimal
we only have 2.4 gigahertz
lastly performance forward the CPU is
I haven't talked about yet
is actually a better life so a better life here
I recommend this tablet definitely not
you've probably already guessed it
that is left only puny and 3450
it has the old band
I probably don't recommend getting it
Hi this is Travis with POSGuys.com.
T3, this is the third generation of the Dash tablet.
The previous Dash tablet was a 7
I have it paired with a couple matching peripherals.
So tablet and all-in-one computer, all in one.
hi everyone welcome back to the channel
cintiq 22 inch hd touch and
i have an xp pen
i gave one of these away last year
and they've made some really cool improvements to this version
so we're going to take a look at the outside
meaning we're going to look at the connections
what you need to connect this to the computer
i know that they have some
one of the things i like about this
xp pen is the build quality
they did a really good job putting this thing together
there's not a lot of fanciness
i love the fact that it's super clean right now
it's all very well put together and again
the second one is a usbc connection
which is the next connection here
we had the cover plate
we had all the cables
they actually went battery free which is incredibly cool
that stuff doesn't happen anymore
if you look at the cintiq stylus
it's got this rubber grip here
you got the rocker button here
and then it's got this flare towards the tip right
that is really good ergonomics
not quite as much if you take a look
almost like it feels almost like a cloth
when you're drawing the xp pen nib is pretty comfortable
this stylus definitely does feel a lot better
this is the stylus holder
so if i were to open this up
there's the stylus nice and safe
you can pull it out
and what's cool about this end here
so what you could do
this pen is the pa
i'm not sure which one it is
but it's either the pa5 or the pa6
it's happened to me a whole bunch of times
i thought maybe i broke something or maybe
the xp pen driver wasn't acting correctly
now we've taken a look at the back
we have it connected to the computer now
let's go ahead and see
which is pen tablet right
click go over to options open at login
you want to have this going so you
by the time you go to be creative and now
i automatically the way i have my cintiq set up
i will say this is really responsive
they have done a much better job
let's go to my other favorite drawing program
i like the combination of sketchbook and xp pen together
it's just a little bit but to be honest
their quality of product is incredible for example
i wish wacom had something like this
so you're looking at used
that's it for me you guys
hey it's Josh of Gotham and or authority
what's going on everybody and this is a Sony
you'll see this notion permeate throughout the review but first
let's take a look at design in this 10-inch tablet
you'll find the dual speaker setup
so you might find yourself throwing this tablet around like
you get the same advantages on this much
I found no reason to fault
I did see from time to time
they do get pretty loud
that's maybe sitting on the table in front of you
it doesn't really try too hard and like
Sony's very stylized take on Android
you can get the quick settings that are editable
that go over your workspace for quick multitasking
iterations out there so you can get the Sony
Samsung does put into its tablets
you really do have something special
and that is definitely what the z2 tablet feels like
I never talked about that I should.
The tablet I paid for.
The one I reinstalled after every single product review.
That’s what I paid for.
Wacom sent me a Cintiq
Did they tell me to make a review?
No. Am I doing one anyway?
Yes. First of all, the old 27QHD, too big.
24 is the perfect size.
What a dumb fool I was.
The monitor arm changed my life.
I can treat it like a second monitor.
I can literally dance while I draw.
I never could get the hang of onscreen keyboards.
They’re too slow, not tactile.
I type like a shark going after a bloody steak.
Gotta feel the keys, put my teeth in that meat.
Digital keyboards, blech. Touch function, blech.
I always keep touch off.
I accidentally touch stuff with my palm when it’s on.
It’s just a C clamp.
You need a decent desk.
Uuuuuuuughhhhh Funny thing about the old 27 QHD.
I got a screen protector after that.
It does in fact matter.
Back in with the Mac users I guess.
The 24 Pro doesn’t do that.
I turn it on. It works.
And when it fell asleep, it woke up blue.
Had to turn it off and on again.
Magic. The magical tech support trick.
Oh boy, does it have a fan.
Gosh I’m so sensitive to noise I just ugh.
It cycles every few seconds.
speeds in display settings > advanced.
Once I changed that the fan behaved.
Is it a driver issue?
But not today. Not yet.
Maybe the driver will update.
I’m always hoping for a driver
update that fixes one problem and causes another.
So yep, must’ve been a driver issue.
Both tablets do the thing where it says
low battery warning for no reason.
The 24 chugs along despite the fake battery warning.
I always suspect the driver issues.
Fresh installs, rekeying shortcuts by hand
programs, or niche programs like
Moho, or heck, even a simple internet browser.
All I’m saying is do your research.
I tried one of the pens
I thought that would be cool.
The 27QHD is a quiet T-rex.
I have another tablet review for you
sorry for having to tablet reviews back to back
hopefully you know how it goes by now
I think it's a fennec fox
I've tried but you do feel uncomfortable
actually really like the design
I found the pen for this tablet
quite unusual is very thin
here's the usual comparison with my
there is a loop on the end
I don't know what that's for
nib kind of felt unsteady
but this one felt pretty solid
the starti 9:6 are also comes with four shortcut keys
there's an option for it
they were very easy to use though
the surface has a subtle green which feels fairly paper
the tablet worked thoughtlessly with both of them
I was really pleasantly surprised with this tablet
I reviewed I've given them away afterwards
my laptop has issues with the trackpad
so it'll help me navigate better and in case
it's simple straightforward and genuinely nice to use
I was really pleasantly surprised
but in the meantime this is my huffing fighter
I stole a long way to go
please let me know if you have any questions
you can find links in the description below non-affiliated
I don't earn any money from them
but if you want to check them out please do
my channel isn't for kids
thank you so much for the support
I hope you enjoyed the video
I was a messaged by someone from gaomon
I'm probably butchering that name
and so they said to hate
could you review a tablet and this is odd since
I don't really have that much experience with tablets
I mean I researched this as much as I could
they'll take up a lot of room next
it comes with this stand of sorts
and you got like it's pretty smooth
you got a lot of notches and such
you just pull this thing
it seems to work pretty well
it's sturdy you also come with the pen
I think that's what's called
we have some power on buttons some menu buttons
you also see these uh buttons on the side
there might be other functions
we have all the things like the work area the
I don't know so right now
it's it's pretty pretty nice
it's there's very little lag
I also forgot to mention that
so what this tablet does is essentially
I don't know why that is is kind of odd
I asked you guys on Twitter
why would I draw it again
this this is a anti-lgbt
Sid the Science Kid I guess I
so that's what we're gonna do
I know it's eyes are kinda like Squidward ish
Steven universe has an afro right
for what do you expect wowee okay
of course we have to have the inside stomach view
let's see what should we put in the middle
let's just let's just make stick figures cuz
I must I must say you look mighty scrumptious today
how are we gonna do the legs
I don't know I'm assuming he's like wearing pants
yes that that would be a good move
I'm so proud of myself
how are we gonna color the Sun
we have the fill tool
mmm that's some good stomach thing
let's just use basic colors for pearl
Steven universe he has like a red
do you need any more convincing
do you need any more convincing
I mean look at this
I don't really have any major problems with it
I'm not sure about price range
I loved it so much
it really reminds me of vexes art
Pablo here on the front
I mean back in 2005
I'm really excited to try this out
which is a little different for me
I want to turn it over
it's just making my fingers feel weird but who knows
maybe you'll like it if you're accustomed to it
I take my brush pen
I lighten my second sketch layer
this tablet has been really good
trying to figure out you know
I assumed you always needed
I'm really impressed by that
drawing these stone edges pretty easy so
my lines were kind of constricted
I'm one of those artists that like to do
this is her skin and this is her skin
this is your skin skin skin
this is her skin and it
but sometimes like right here sometimes
I just got tired of that and I was like
she doesn't look too serious and so right now
I'm using the Dodge tool
which if any of you guys have seen
I guess you could say particularly with her glowing tattoo
I can't really explain them
I don't like that one
I'm working on the hair
yeah that works and then
I'm not sure if I'm just accessing it wrong
I'm so excited to have shown you
I think it did pretty fantastic
obviously some issues with the pen no eraser
sorry no boring unboxing videos for you
it's super cheap and it's like 60 bucks
it's a really good entry option
this is a really nice tablet
it's very large compared to the other ones
it doesn't work particularly well for that
I don't know if you can see that
I notice no lag at all
maybe a newer one would work
it turned off because usually my hand ends up
the one model is only available in
they didn't have the wireless time at the time that
so if you're gonna be traveling with these
I travel a full time in an RV
so portability is really important for me
so how about sometimes really portable is nice
so it's kind of a toss-up between those two again
they just a slightly different size
just nice to have so again
because it's just a really beefy
it does have a eraser on the other end
but really this one just feels amazing
it has kind of a rubbery surface to it
the pro mods actually kind of squishy
so you can see it
there's a good feel to it
there's barely a flange on it
it's very skinny very light and just has no
clicky feeling it's it feels cheap
it doesn't feel comfortable in your hand
it feels smooth as butter
it's a little bit noisier
it's just a different feeling so
I don't know if we'll be able to hear this
but here's the pro and here is the into us
I've never had any problem with it
Wireless so I'm really impressed with that
I don't know if the Intuos works the same
so the battery life seems to be really good so
I did with the top button
turns it into the zoom tool so now
you should know about in photoshop up here
just turn these two settings off so
I'm sure what they do
it feels more like using a mouse
so that's useful but where
based upon how hard address we keep the same opacity
sensitivity is controlling the size
then you have a different pressure
sensitive is become a lot more important but for photographers
it's really easy to do
not exactly what I want
I like to leave both of them on
let me make this a lot bigger so now
I kind of paint that in
let me make that smaller
I don't have very good control with this
I think I programmed one of these
it's like this bottom button here
there's lots you can do with this and like
I said you can zoom with this
scroll wheel on the pro version but you can see
it just does this jerky zooming by a large amount
and it doesn't zoom where you want it to
I would say most people just need the small size
so wherever you put your pen
Photoshop is only going to be this
the entire tablet to one screen when
I'm using Photoshop so what I've done here is
I've set up a custom application for Photoshop
and then under mapping what
I can use my entire thing for both screens
I don't think it really matters
I would probably recommend getting the medium size
then you might consider getting a medium-size tablet
I really wouldn't recommend that unless you absolutely have to
I found the small to be just fine
I had lot of fun making it
I got in the gallon
one as 620 graphics tablet pad
you can purchase it in various regions
it does seem to be like right off the bat
alright everything's kind of laid out in here pretty accordingly
it's a fairly small very lightweight tablet
coming in here for a bit of a closer look
now in the nice little soft case but yeah
I thought this was pretty cool
I haven't got one of these tablets
this is a battery for you
pen it's slightly thinner than my usual into s1
Express keys up here at the top again
there's a few other features
is you put it on a desk draw it
I can't exactly test the duration of that
the workspace gives a bit of information
we can set the fan
it has a lot of these basic features
it's letting me do numbered keys or our letter keys
so that's interesting now for the work area
I was also getting interesting results with this as well
there's a little bit of finicky nough sand
I hit the right click option
let's try getting a brush
what kind of options so yeah
you know in that instance but yeah
you know who is this for it
it's probably gonna be for you as well as you
can you get a lot more functionality
on the go of it so see
this is just a great little drawing
I like a screen a drawing like a Cintiq
they seem to really like it
yeah on a sketch like this
and and of course the beauty of this is
it's probably gonna be something
I hope this was informative for you and take care
I'll see you next time
who merely wants to use it
but is it any better
i clearly understand the decision to make this product
feel a little premium with the metal build but statically
well here's the new no joy 11.
i'll let you be the judge to comment
which one looks better okay
so let's get to the hardware specifications
the new joy 11 isn't significantly faster than its predecessor
despite using a faster processor with more
active pen is sold separately
i highly recommend the latter keyboard
cover that is priced at 199
because they capitalized the e at the end you know
I gave myself about a six out of ten
it's got white in a shiny gold
look at that it's beautiful
presentation makes me feel special
I haven't really seen on other tablets before
but we're gonna get more into that later
you're going in the sack everybody next
it's uh that's it next
I got this nice little pouch
I do like the little pouch though
it's like a secret secret knife pouch
yeah tell us that okay
let's look at the pen for this again
little pouch for slimmer knives
I assume look at that
that's a nice looking pen
it's got the buttons on it
let's just put this on uh-huh yeah now
you can look edgy and cool disclaimer
I don't use a lot of pen pressure
you know when it comes to lines
unique is the little circle button on the side
the tablet itself is pretty light yet sturdy
there are probably ways to fix this
would you like to save it
it's a very decent tablet and pretty standard
I don't know what that means but neither do you
probably not gonna do it again
this is kind of painful
Bharti gets by thank you
this is full-on 10-inch octa-core tablet and it runs
so what exactly makes this so cool
there is almost no lag on top of that
so you're pretty much set to go
it also supports basic things that a lot of
which makes things really really cool now my day-to-day
maybe I got like three hours
it looks really really premium
it just feels nice in your hand
you guys enjoyed this video
this is going to be me logging on
Sebastian here from noble fugu studio
this is the artist 12
let's see what the artist 12
Pro has brought to the market specs wise
we've a fully laminated 1080p
let's see how my week went with this tablet
the pressure sensing is responsive
had no issues with it really one thing
it works nicely one thing
they're responsive they feel nice
because you can set up your own macros
but my back and my neck hurt when
I'm trying to use this device at this angle
the stand is not great
moving on to the setup of this tablet
that go into your computer and finally you power
I'm going to be completely transparent here
I seriously enjoy drawing on the artist
the performance of this device
impressed me so much that
I will admit that I am disappointed
thank you guys for watching
you're going to invest in either
it be this one or another one my hope that
I could help you out by just sharing my experience
all opinions are 100% authors
don't catch any of that that's okay
it is while it's turning on it is none okay
just turn it on before you need to do that
um overall using it it was it's great to use
it's a good size its handheld
it's this this comes on and off
also you can see all of thee
Ablett's but this one does keep up and it holds
I'll go over the apps in one second let me
if you're reading just reading
some of these are mine
sorry you can see my decorations help over there
so you can split it up
geometry - it came with which is a fun kids
I just hold it like this
it's not it doesn't slide very easily and like
I said I really like that
I like that big fan of that
cute adorable little kids tablet
I'm saying so basically it works
it's a good good option and good safety
so that's pretty much it link to it below
we're doing something a little different
which in this case is an unboxing
hey do you want to review one of our products
so you know what sure
why not they were kind enough
the tablet itself the stylus pen the cord for it
that's actually the first time i've ever seen that
now here's something about tablets with buttons
so this tablet does it draw
don't worry if it looks like i'm struggling
that's just my drawing process
i will say that something i like about
this tablet is just how wide it is
so here's the big question
it's not the cheapest tablet but here's the thing
i mean it is a tablet
i've been pronouncing their company name right
i'll be seeing you later
gamers thank you very much to galamond you
these are the brightness buttons
this is louder and softer
this is the help screen
this is the camera button
gasps oh my purchased a few already the unit
AB comes with a stylus
you can used to put the oil co gram
is it two of them it
actually um that goes here
doctor um little standards that you can
hello hello how would you like to play
I don't do that right now
um ereader games art studio the camera like left
alright look at the video recorder it notes
he loves the camera and the camera left
I'll take pictures of himself
um and it's really fun
I think that's his favorite thing to do
I'm going to show you
we'll go like princess hat
I'll make a book like that pirate
I'm not even in the picture
I mean he thought this was fun
yeah as you can see
this is what his last project was
I'm keeping the stylus away from him
we have the books on the cartridges
and he's just learning so much and the mp3 player
I'm going to be downloading some music from him
you can not close this up
you'll move to it now which one
I can do it with one
that's it we love it
I really really love and it just
this comes in pink so
I mean that's really cute so this is for home
we love this for at home
and the mobi go-to that's in the diaper bag
central perfect gift can't say it for the birthday
thank you mom central bye
and this could be the perfect gift for your child
i have this with me
it's the pebble gear frozen to a tablet
2. the tablet features a seven inch touchscreen display
it's got a standard quad core processor
they drop things all the time
very reason it's not indestructible
perhaps then there could be damage behind the bumper
it's okay and it's priced to reflect that
she found it easy to navigate
the buttons on screen are big
and i have to say
they're pretty good upon initial setup
i like the idea of my eldest
pebble is calling it game store junior
the first year is completely free
an eight-year-old spends 500 pounds on gold or gems
well that won't happen here
the other feature being an e-reader works well too
it does what it's meant to do
hey guys what's going on it's on here from
well it's called pika going
it could do both solid
they actually have a campaign going on right now which
now it's not a super impressive
CPU BAU elaborate more on that
that's the only differences there
I'm at 150 which gives me a little bit more
desktop real estate back another thing you might have noticed
why they say it might be a tablet
you could press it all day long
this guy is about a cup of coffee
megapixel which is 640 by 480
you can't hear a thing
this guy was very very easy
because the mouse left/right click is right there
I was able to type at normal
it just works even though you might think
I said as far as typing wise
this is typing whoops test
brightness is actually not a problem actually
Reddit or stuff like that
it doesn't have a problem
I would do to type in IP addresses or typing
come in and stuff like that
it is very very useful a couple of features that
I do like about this
is that when you flip it backwards
I could read this like a tablet
I could actually scroll we go through
read it go through whatever
it was very very hard like
I thought this guy will replace it
what what can you know the
so it's a give or take on those situations
yes absolutely because of the screen
this screen is gorgeous compared to all the other ones
probably not if you're more towards traveling yours
you need to check emails all the time
check this out is the new
I'm not gonna like it
I really wasn't taking it all that seriously
hey don't feel bad little guy
the artist 12 is a pen display
this is the smallest screen display of this kind
I've personally ever drawn on
the screen is 11.6 inches
it's not a laminated display
everything else is just like this one
those are really slick to draw on
there are preset settings for this
it's nice to have not every display
it has a little slide bar like this
I've used swiping a lot
I wish it was a little more sensitive also
what's that you want me to tell them
it's all combined into one
which makes it a little easier to move around
you're also gonna find your power adapter
I think that about covers it
expeed pen also sent me a stand
it's light easy to move around
hold your display in place really well
it also doesn't come with the tablet itself
you have to buy it extra
the pen feels incredibly smooth
I'm drawing this inktober illustration that
you've seen me drawing in the background
I just didn't need it
this is a battery free pen
it has 8,192 levels of pressure
that's just not something you see much on non
thanks to the flat sided
yes I googled the word hexagonal for this review
let's go to the drawing test
straight angled lines look good when drawn by hand
they look better when you draw them with the ruler
it's got a very good initial activation rate holding pressure
really well around curves so
I did nothing here as soon as I installed it
this 12 inch form factor
I can pull it off my desk
set it on my lap
I said before there is some parallax
that's the difference between where your pen tip is
is this some folks looking for hotspots on their displays
it's not really a hot spot
good it's all I've got for today
i'm glad y'all could join us today
first of all i want to apologize my last video
let me go back on that
let's clean that up right now
not right now right now
okay now check this out
they got magazines out there
man uh uh um what
here's the killer part you want to know
the spectacular part about this particular magazine is free
just you'll see them when you get up there
if you guys out there remember what i said
pick one up for yourself
let's get into this now
let me make this statement
i will only be showing you
monday is our art preview
but let's get into this review
okay check it out all right
oh my god look at this thing man
let's see what we gonna get in this
let me do it this way
oh there we go you see that okay
ah okay dog here we go damn okay man
i can already tell you right now
i can already tell you this is good
this is great in fact this is great
now how am i going to okay
let me do it this way
we'll get it out of here
oh this is a separate box okay
damn i'm to put this right here for now
i told you it was greatly packed
hold on okay here we go
there's nothing wrong with that okay
so let's put this down and let's move this
i think this is the pin
let's move this out the way it's over here somewhere
we definitely don't want to drop this
okay let's set this up here
i guess this was in here like this
okay bam very nice check it out
are you ready for this
this is a art canvas electronic art canvas
i think i got it off
uh amazon for 700 and something dollars
um everything comes with instructions everything okay
how else will we know how to operate
okay here we go thank you for choosing here
okay and look i think let me see
this thing does a lot
you can hook this up
oh my god laptop anything man
oh my god of course but yeah
i'm going to get this from your body
let's see what's up with this here
oh man just for another little
you understand what this is okay
let's check out the euron
you need man 20 inch canvas
they got this look at this plastic
they got this in what
are y'all seeing that it's got buttons on both sides
you know so i'll get set and adjust your colors
pause erase all that color palette buttons and look
let's do this one together
let's put this one together
let's see how that sounds
let's see oh my god look at that screen anyway
this is what i was talking about
somebody should left that on there
the glove is so that was yeah
let me bring this in a little closer
so you guys can check this out
you got some buttons on it up here
i think you got power
we got hdm hdmi out
so i'll know the next time
let me come back over here
i'm thinking this stand okay
it'll stand by itself so you can draw on it
okay just these let out these legs
we got that part out of the way
this is the one that was 9.99
when it first came out i think 9.99
let's get back to the pen and check this pin
this is not a regular pen
it's a special pen you know
the pin is everything okay
oh look at that look at the pants
oh man oh it's got two buttons on it
so i'm thinking yeah it's a great deal
there's nothing up here okay
but a sensor probably for the heron itself
yeah this is a good device
i don't know i know quality
come on maybe i should lay that on the screen
okay and we're gonna have this thing put all together
let's see what comes in this box
here let me open this up
let's see what we got here
okay now we got the screws
we got the screws to screw that device
hey okay let's see what else is in the box
it comes in the box standard hdmi
i said your computer or anything
i don't know this is a mystery
what would this be for
don't tell nobody if i'm not mistaken
oh my god we got another chord in here too
okay this is a standard vga display
that's crazy yeah we don't you got to go
don't go find a screwdriver
you don't even have to go do that
you got to go around the house
i was running with the cruiser
we're going to do a bonus video out here
they got a tactical laser
they also have a retro arcade in the building
the falling alley's cool man
who knows what they got out there
yes yes in your in your community
don't perform that great they're acceptable
I don't see many people using them
so it's enough talk about the cameras
we're not going to talk about that anymore
wow this is a really good screen
so let's just take a look in the app drawer
so that's a little bit of a disappointment
I've been testing works absolutely fine
it's a very very good performance
this size is really enjoyable
it's really good fun so
something also noticed is why holding the tablet
let's put it that way
this is a fantastic choice
it does also click dust a little bit more
let's just take one more look at the screen
now obviously we have got a 13.3
inch screen here with that full
just how much of a bargain this is
this is well worth checking out
thank you very much for watching
Hello again and welcome to yet
This is the Vankyo MatrixPad S20, and the MatrixPad S21.
and which tablet may be right for you.
So stay tuned that’s up next.
So I’m back and inside both boxes
the contents are the same.
You get the tablet itself.
A 5V 2A amps DC power adapter.
And your user’s manuals and gift card.
Both models come with a front facing 5MP camera.
which means it can run a 64 bit applications.
So that’s it for system and hardware information.
Let’s now compare the Antutu benchmark scores of both models.
So the S20 outperforming the S 21 x 1200 points.
I will now test the responsiveness of both models.
To test their entertainment features
I installed Netflix directly from the Google
play store on both models.
I have the same video open on both tablets.
S20 is the better of the two.
So have come to the end of my review.
Give this video the thumbs up
it's my first time doing one
so um if i sound a little bit awkward
it's because i don't know what i'm doing today
i know that's not my usual content
it's because i'm currently in the process of unexpectedly moving
okay sorry for all that exposition
let's get into the actual unboxing and review
i'll also put a screenshot of them as well
this tablet is a lot smaller than i'm used to
there's actually a matte screen protector
uh so it's up to you
the tablet has eight express keys for shortcuts
they make a pretty satisfying clicking
sound when you press them
i really didn't have any issues with setup
it's a little bit confusing
unfortunately the contrast on this tablet isn't the best
and it's one of my biggest critiques
about the tablet overall who is blasting their base outside
this would bring the tablet down to about 173 usd
i'll include links to the amazon listing in the description
i didn't experience much lag
there is some parallax as you can see here
the cursor doesn't quite line up with a pen nib
the tablet doesn't seem to support tilt either
it can be used both as a flat pen
there's a power cord in hdmi
use the pen itself is lightweight and very cylindrical
cylindrical god i did have an issue
initially whoa basically you just press the button
oh my god my dogs are fighting
okay come on hello okay my okay yet
foreign foreign blue foreign pink tablet bye
also including in the box
at the tablet it has got four customizable
the driver was actually pretty easy
you can actually open this tab
which will show you different features of your pen
and your tablet you can customize the four
Express keys on your tablet
I did not do much
moving on to the speed pane part
I have to cut everything
and it's such a hassle but it's fine
I actually did another sketch of this drawing
just didn't have a lot of like flow and movement
it just didn't look how
she turned out the whole concept about her hair
I don't know and another thing that I struggled
which was the biggest struggle was the background
I had no idea what to do with the background
I just kept it as how it was originally
I still don't like the background
that's the only thing that bothers me about this drawing
I feel like it clashes a lot
let me know what you guys think about
the background should have done a different or should
more about the tablet another thing that
I forgot to mention before
it's gonna be still white
oh just the light is gonna light
we'll never use the pen now
I really really like how this tablet works
it's really as big as my laptop keyboard
that's how big it was so
I really like the small size of this one
I don't have to charge it
oh no my pen is gonna die then
I really like the fact about this pen
I don't know why I'm struggling with this one
but it's kind of thin
click on the pen so
I mean the tablet works but the cable is broken
it makes like it has a little problem connection
I don't know and my pen is also broken
I recommend this tablet totally for anyone
I really hope that it was fine
and if you have any suggestions on how
I could make reviews more interesting
let me know in the comments down below
I would love to know that but yeah
I really hope you all enjoyed watching this video
I upload a new video
thank you all so much for watching once again
a lot of people have questions about
let's look at the device itself
that is sort of a drawing of a seashell
stylus is definitely a huge plus
let me know in the comments
what you think about the books nova 3
hello and thanks for joining me today
Tech's new top-of-the-line CF 20
it is the number one choice for EMS professionals
it's also lightweight and portable weighing only 3.9 pounds
book arts hard drive heaters so protected keyboard and protected
it also comes standard with glove multi-touch capability this means
the primary battery can be found in the tablet
Ethernet port headphone jack and a 1080p
the keyboard has two more
20 comes standard with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
CPU GPU and ram but with the 10 inch
and right here we have an Amazon 10
these come in at 150 dollars
the fire 10 is much more powerful
plus the dual speakers built into the fire
and then we're gonna move into some benchmarks some native
now this is a low-end cpu
CPU that Amazon uses in their fire
HD 8 the GPU is a Mallee t7 20 MP
2 this is a dual core
both cameras are absolute garbage like on most tablets
I said in my last video
this is probably reading ebooks
Walmart icon if we click on this
beat them all out once again
tablets are on the lower end of the android spectrum
there are cheaper phones out there
GPU benchmark was ice storm again
fire ten destroyed all three of these
let's take a look at some native
it's not as bad as I thought it would be
the tablet fits right in here
I will leave a link in the description to Amazon
I'm streaming project cars too from my main gaming PC
it performs well especially with that
it brings me back into the steam interface
but it was still very laggy
there's a few other systems
that just aren't gonna work well on this hardware
like dreamcast n64 sega saturn
SNES pc engine Game Boy Game Boy
Advance even d/s using drastic from the Google
some other systems that work
your app of choice is here's
video from the internal storage so overall
if you could hit that like button
maybe subscribe to the channel but like always
hey everybody annex here today
I'm gonna be doing a review of the huion
campus pro 12 drawing tablet now
this drawing tablet is really good
if you want to improve your art so basically
you also get a little wipe you get this
I use for this tablet personally
it's called fire alpaca 60
it looks like this little like alpaca
which makes it super smooth like
let's see how far behind the pen
ooh this one is marked at 60 799
LPI and 10 millimeter reading height
this one comes with a protective caps
little nice pouch is where
this little nice pouch contains the extra nibs
QuickStart guide and the website for the drivers download
this also has two programmable buttons
m106 k and as you can see
that's how I like it no
I don't think I'll be changing that
and you could program the two buttons here right button
it's on whatever default it is
I'm not really gonna change that right now
you have your keys and hotkeys
I mentioned that there were twelve additional buttons there
let's say okay this one's also B
I can go ahead and do that
going back to the tablet settings
I recommend going into screen ratios
in my animations is draw those really like detailed faces
I guess kind of reminds me of those
those really crude close-ups in spongebob
I'm still not used to well
what is happening slowly drew my face
I think these are what people call the panda eyes
this is the face of
make these lips stick out a bit more perfectionist
okay oh god it's beautiful
I don't even draw the eyebrows
it's that's how tired I am
just be like hey when you want
I'm tired yeah perfect awesome
alright that's yes okay turned out really good
I should use his face in the future animation
you know rough drawings and whatnot
this one is definitely fits
the name of the more professional drawing tablet
I still considered this one also portable
it's it's a little bit smaller than the syntek
I'd say that's still pretty portable
you're good to go so whoa
what's my verdict on this tablet
I've only drawn with this for about a week
and this type of tablet
thank you guys for watching
what's the difference between the different tablets
I mean to be honest
they're all pretty much kind of in the same boat
maybe it's the texture of the tablet but definitely
it has a core i5
Haswell CPU like I mentioned
Haswell chip available but it's reasonably fast
there are no physical keys
you're not actually pushing down on anything
has this touch sensitive unusual keyboard
that's good for typing out short items
I really like this device the keyboard
I'm not such a big fan of you can see
it's a backlit keyboard below it
it's just a keyboard that
I don't particularly love other interesting features
include a 2560 by 1440 pixels display and right now
I've got handbrake open here
these actually look really tiny here though
now that's not really Dells fault
they might not look great now desktop apps
do look pretty good so you can see here
we've got the Netflix app
we're able to run two videos side by side
I've written a bunch of articles for lilliputian
it gets around six to seven hours of battery life
make sure to carry the charger with you
it's not quite cell phone charged or compact
well the keyboards not so much of an issue
this configuration sells for $1,300
you can sometimes find it on sale for under 1200
I'd say especially when you consider that tablets
I mean it's nice to have these tablet functions
I'm sort of holding it on the table
you can find more details that little appearing calm
let's find out the max
10 is made of smooth black plastic with rounded corners
the screen bezel is nicely
the max 10 is slightly heavier than most expensive tablets
but you don't really notice the 926 grams of weight
the display is difficult to read
at the bottom is where the speakers are positioned wireless
them sound is average and muted
this is where the tablet shows its budget
lack clarity and color accuracy
video recording is no better
i took from the two cameras
like word or excel with covid lockdown
10 tablet decent display for budget tablet
most people will find the battery life on the max
10 to be more than acceptable during testing with general
10 lasted a day on average shame
it didn't come with fast charging stock android
a pleasant surprise is the clean stock android 9
that comes with the max
the images come out washed down and color
accuracy is poor to add to this
the camera app is not intuitive
i wouldn't touch the camera except to call your friends
10 is a worthy android tablet
what do you guys think
leave your comments and discuss below
hope you guys enjoyed the review of the dragon
so let's dig in a little bit first off
there's no need for an unboxing you get the tablet
you have a jack for headphones
get used to it play with it a bit
we already seen on the box
I can't stress this enough
there's no blow where that means a lot to me
you got a 1.5 gigahertz processor
this is actually a pretty good little tablet
I'm gonna go with the negative first
the camera is really bad
you're not even gonna want to use it
you can see the picture
I did the slingshot benchmark test
I already did it so I'll just show you
the results got a 217
I'll scroll through right here
I do have to admit it runs cool
that's that's pretty cool 19 degrees
Celsius frames per second 1 to 18 just for reference
Android PI it operating system
actually it's just slow it works
well just slow um all right
well let's get into the good dough
Amazon music works great Amazon Kindle for e-books works great
I think they could have added a couple watts
so there's a Netflix and here's Prime
nice little interface watch now trailer
see not bad all right
Hulu actually runs a really nice on this machine
it's already started and last but not least
I could so about all that you know it
I was curious about the graphics on this
it runs rather rather good you
how good this thing can work play
yeah you gotta love the soundtrack on his game too
I used to play this on the seal than that
I'm asking at all there
it's not glitchy in swim
it's got some issues between the camera
I got the I think it's called the k10
it's a 10 inch tablet
yeah it's it's it's done me
well it's it works great
it's actually quite quite fast
this is the 8 inch screen version
it looks a lot like the galaxy
s4 basically their you know their design
language is very very close to each other
it has that 8 inch
so it's not necessarily a full 1080p display
get to that in a second 16
gigs of internal storage on this device
although there is a 32 gig model microSD card slot
if you need even more than that
megapixels 4450 milliamp hour battery inside that is non-removable
we'll start with the design
button a capacitive menu button on the device
you can see the notification
it would pull down fine it just really
it's probably best suited for video conferencing battery
what more can I say solid performance
the battery didn't really run out on me although
that was really handy smart
TouchWiz is excellent for that
you're probably going to like this device for everyone else
thanks for watching my review
Adele and this is my son Jacob
it comes with a keyboard on it
right hey comes with a keyboard which is absolutely brilliant
you've got documents you can do
lots of things on this tablet great with the keyboard
it's just so much fun
there's lots to do on there
you know it's great for kids
it keeps the parents happy
because there's you know parental controls on there
but um just wanted to to show you guys
the keyboard itself is excellent as well
so this is actually a metal keyboard
the keyboard feels really good
10 uh standard windows 10 tablet experience
and i've found um i found
which only has a 1080p resolution but goes much brighter
um i'm not sure on the exact
uh oh sorry 3k version um the reason
the resolution is a little bit odd 3000 by 2000
it's actually uh slightly um slightly different slightly taller
um you can see that it's actually really thin
it seems to be um quite a uh i guess
so the hinge hinge is quite good
it has three usbc ports
this particular version is the spec out version
so it has a fingerprint reader as well
it's a metal metal design and looks
as far as as far as the tablet goes
it's a lot more expensive than the surface pro
um so that's how i've been operating lately
the of of the spare sim card
life's been a little bit poor to be honest
it's it lasts for about three hours
it actually does last a lot longer
i do like the the back of the laptop
it does feel quite hefty
that's my review of the hp elite x2
g4 i'll be uh posting this shortly online
um let me know in the comments
if you think any i should have done anything
uh for this first product review
i'll catch you guys next time
hey guys so in front of me
this is the latest dragon
now this tablet does come in two different versions
the original version has two gigabyte of ram
i wasn't really expecting much of it
so here's the box and everything that was inside
first of all we have our max
we have a warranty card
this tablet actually comes with a two year warranty
just make sure you activate your warranty next
we have a very lengthy user manual
that shows you exactly how to work the max10 tablet
inside of here it runs off of android 9.0
pi and the screen display here is a ips full
it does support stereo music
you have this little removable tab
the body is supposedly made out of aluminum
it changes the color of the screen that way it
it answered my question for me
hey google what day is it right now
it is friday july 24th 2020.
i know a lot of people ask
we use it every single year
guys display is very clear actually
i have also downloaded several apps
i am not too good at games guys
but let's give this a try
looks like i did okay there
let's go to the next one
i think i was playing this back in uh college
this is the latest version
all right so that's pretty easy and okay
let me try to shoot this guy
i think i just killed somebody
i died just like that okay
let's try this again again
this game is pretty fun guys
i'm just very bad at it okay
where's everybody oh oh oh come on come on
come on shoot him shoot him
oh wow i actually killed somebody
are you on my team
oh oh what's going on here
oh i reload too slow
i thought i was bad
i'm horrible with games as well
these games haven't been changed much
uh through the past over 10 years now
these games have not changed much
you can do a lot of gaming
this is what the book looked like
i'm so excited to unbox this
new small and powerful deco mini 7 wireless
first of all thanks to hun
it is small and light
our pen is battery free
let's unbox this little guy here
let's take the tablet out and you can see that
it has a nice plastic cover to protect it
let's paint some great odds shall we
there is another protective plastic
we will remove the plastic later
so it stays firm on the table while you're drawing
let's see what else is inside this box
there is another pack of stuff inside
there's a leaflet here printed separately
that shows you how to use it with android
it's pretty small and light and you don't lose it
it is the same with my other deco series tablet
here's all the items we have in the box
hold it till it shows the blue light
which is the deco mini
i'm happy with the performance in photoshop
i'm proceeding to test with microsoft word
i uses the ink brush to test it
the small size graphic tablet works great with android devices
it is affordable at the price of 59.9 dollar
it is light and portable
not only that it has a tilt function
hi guys and welcome back to my channel today
I'll leave a link at the end of this video
what are my thoughts on this one
so guys my first thing about this tablet is that
do the setup setup on this one was the screen
it's it's it's quite weird
Nokia 1 plus smartphone that I brought to this channel
I usually do that but with this one
the cameras are not good at all the front camera
let me let me try and show you
Android software on this one
I've got a couple of educational
I'm not really putting too much on this one
they're not great at all and you know
I think that's a great option
I think it is great now in terms of sound
I think that the speaker is really poor
so it's kind of poor the sound
I guess I'll show you a sample in a bit
it's not great and you
it does the job obviously
let's check the speakers so yeah as you can see
the speaker is not great and most of the times
so it's not great placement others speak
I think it is a great purchase
it's it's amazing where you get
I'm happy with the software
I think the software is good to have Android
I mean I wish I could get more with this
I wish I could get a USBC 1080p display
we have a new device here
today we are unboxing this device
let's look at some specifications here
the packaging looks like some cheap
the actual tab is on the on the right side
we have power switch here
nothing's here let's turn on the tab
we have very fairly stock android
let's look at the sensors
the sensors in the elixir to application
i tried a lot but other sensors
i get the readings here
let's look at the other specification of the tab
it has some very bad viewing angles
i can't see anything from the side view
only i have another galaxy tab here
now let's took uh let's play a game here
why city here it is vice city game
so how is the sound quality sound quality actually
yeah it's the maximum sound here
okay we can skip that
i can almost play the game
okay fine we are back now
we go for quadrant standards benchmark
hmm okay we have the quadrant benchmarks here
the device scored at 2943
let's tell the camera quality
we have very laggy screen here
let's take a photo here
it's only 640 by 480
okay have a good time friends
sibel hi everybody and welcome back to the channel
today i have for you
a review of the zenpad z10 connected tablet
great sound and great for connectivity
we have a quick charge
we have a nine point seven inch 2k display
up to hundred twenty eight gigabytes
the sim ejector tool out of the box
we have dual stereo speakers
you can go to blue light filter
I personally like to keep it as vivid
this is a hexa core processor
SD card that I mentioned to you guys
I only get like barely two to three bars
you can use it to play games
I was definitely very happy to play
Need for Speed Most Wanted as you guys saw
it definitely handled the game pretty good
do all the things that you normally do now
we still have split screen and functionality
you're gonna be able to get this on
we're gonna be able to get and of course if
are going to be here very very nice
let's do a quick video audio sample for you overall
the sound is pretty good
it's tuned to generate the sound on the right side
the sound will come more closer to you
now you do have a three and half millimeter
headphone jack to use with this
let's do a quick video sample on the camera
I'll go ahead and switch over to the front-facing camera
it'll start off with the video
this is a five megapixel front facing sensor
this is definitely kind of work
I don't think people like us to take pictures
this is mostly for videoconferencing and enjoying content
I showed you guys in the beginning
this little basically splendid display app
and then you can expand that application management
Zen motion is really that was function
I guess II for email C for camera
I guess we have two different ones for camera
which will last you extremely long
this is again a nine point
I've tried looking into this
show a clock widget weather information and quick access applications
you can change those as well next thing
of course we have security account language
the notification shade is customizable
snappy it's actually not bad overall for what you get
the zenpad z10 is definitely a media
that hasn't been a discussion about that
it's possibly with my son
it has a built in 78 million battery
I'm not sure if I mentioned that to you guys
thank you very much for the support
I'll see you guys in the next video
it's a pretty versatile and pretty inexpensive
it has a starting price of just about $300
it's been a lot less powerful than more expensive chips
but it's much more powerful than it used to be
I think with full screen applications
so for instance when we're looking at desktop mode here
and then there's a headphone jack and that's about it
the microUSB port you'll notice here is the only port
you'll want to use the included
adapter if you want to charge relatively quickly
I found that it charges very slowly
we're looking here at the weather application
what you do have is support for a digital pen
you can do that if you wanted to
let's go ahead and try to write something now
it's nice to have the option
it's about a thirty dollar accessory
but it's not my favorite accessory
my favorite accessory is the $40 folio case
I'm just trying to get a better view here
I really like the folio case
it gets closer to nine hours of battery life
what do they want to do here
let's take a look at whoops
it's a little bit slower
it's definitely also not the best device for everybody
hey there's all new merch over at crowdmade.com talk secure
i'm back with the pd
we should probably take a look at it
inches massive can't picture it
it's sturdy solid and towering
you will also need an ac power outlet
the unique thing about this tablet is the matte finish
but that's more a matter of preference for me
the 178 degree stand is way above the previous tablet
it gives the option to almost
i didn't have to install the stand myself
can't override it now personally
the last one gaomon sent me pretty much sat untouched
that was probably a lot gentler than anticipated
what does that mean no idea
check it out in the links below a huge
i've used this is definitely my favorite
this is a review unit
we have the pen pouch and the pen
we'll take a look at this closer later
one artists glove nip remover and replacement tips
they included a lot of extra tips so many that
I don't even want to count them
the design is very nice and clean very straightforward
this is a single piece of drawing area
this tablet is very thin
this pan is not powered by battery
this tablet is supported on
Mac OS and also Windows
the driver functionality is essentially the same just that we
let's go into you mapping
it actually looks like a trackpad
because there's no doubt the first app
I see some issues here
it's not as smooth here as well
so the shortcut buttons they
are they work really well
I don't really see any issues here
I can see that there is pressure
it's blanked out so to get pressure
this may seem a bit pixelated
all back to within this is mini back
paint pearl pressure works fine here very responsive so
I think it works pretty well
here has tried a strokes thinner thick transition
it works quite well here so no issues we have
this is clip studio paint on the Mac pressure sensitivity
alright let's jump to using
it's also quite smooth and now
I'm using Photoshop on Windows
so the quick strokes look fine
I see some abrupt changes in thickness so here
I think it still works fine for drawing purposes
I actually don't draw a lot with Photoshop
I use this mostly for graphic design
work for photo and video editing
looks really well here and this app
it's quite responsive most of the desktop apps that
sensitivity doesn't work by default on clip studio paint
they all work very well so
so that's all for this video review
I hope this is helpful
see you in the next one bye
welcome to a new youtube channel today
so let's start run so so hello guys
so let's see what's in the box

what's else in the box itself
what every button does it's not like
there are overly many buttons that we wouldn't know

we've got a digital wellbeing and parental controls
you can set it up over there
Android 9 device would then connected devices
we can pair it with
Bluetooth there is no NFC
not that you're gonna use
quality is like 5 megapixels

I did the video test

I'll speak to you soon guys bye
hey guys this is a sponsored video
i'll be reviewing today is called the m106k pro
it's a mouthful and it currently costs 63.99 on amazon
or above right off the bat
it's really clean and simple
there's still some weight to it
it's really nice and soft
i think it's a great bag to use
i never actually knew they were called nib clips
but apparently that's what they call them
it's filled with some papers
another thing in this bag is a drawing glove
i love drawing gloves so much
it's like you're using a real pen
last thing in the box is some otg adapters
because i know sometimes people have issues
i was after plugging the tablet into my laptop
if that happens to you
but i just thought i'd mention it
after installing the driver it was really easy
this tablet's pen pressure is insane
i can feel it when i draw
it didn't work like at all
what i'm drawing with this tablet
they can be pretty loud though
whenever i was undoing a lot it turns out
it was just clip studio paint
i'm glad i found this out now
this tablet doesn't do the whole
so thank you for not having that glitch
this tablet also works very well with fire alpaca
i really enjoyed drawing with this tablet
thank you all so much for watching

what's going on guys this
ETA prime back here again today
this is an 8-inch tablet offered by
obviously you get the tablet
this is a single speaker setup
it's gonna have the same CPU and GPU built in
they also share the same screen size
but if you ask me
I want to get into some testing
we have an 8 inch 1280 by 800
I was kind of impressed when I pulled it
there's three Walmart apps I think
so you can pick up that five gigahertz network
let's go ahead and get into some testing
Walmart icon if we click on this
great on this little tablet
I'm just gonna open up
I 264 as you can see here
this is the single core score
they're on par with each other
and you'll see that in just a second
fine here's Minecraft Pocket Edition now
it runs pretty good on here
emulations going to be hit or miss
on this device there are some n64 games
don't expect this device to run
got another ps1 game here
Genesis 32 acts Game Boy Game Boy Color Game Boy
those are kind of out of the question and finally
I'll just give Netflix a quick test here
you can watch whatever you want on these things
I mean it's a decent tablet for the price
over the fire eight HD
this is actually cheaper when the fire eight
so that's pretty much it for this video guys
I really appreciate you watching
see if they got one in stock
shall we alright first up
this is what you get inside the box
area has plus or minus degrees of
actually this is pretty much identical to the huion canvas
they don't work on the opposite tablet
one is a bit strange
you can see what just happened
the stand is not very good
I'm just gonna draw stuff so here
we are doodling away and yet the pen
the pen is pretty decent
they've draws just as great to canvas
Pro 16 panels and since it's a graphics tablet
trying to control the pressure on this pen
I don't find that as useful the touch bar
yeah not a fan of the touch stuff not really
so you couldn't say while you're drawing like the programs
the tablet feels quite solid
the pen feels a little cheaper in the materials
I Oh I dislike that standard immensely
I'd say it's three point
seven five out of five
there are lot less things to go wrong like
I can't knock it that much
we've got plenty of Express keys the multimedia keys
I'm not a fan of that
the pen worked well for the most part though
there's nothing else I can really say about it
so yeah four out of five for that
so value of this tablet is pretty great
it's a fine little graphics tablet
I'd highly recommend it to novices or hobbyists
that's another tablet review done and dusted
this could be the last one who knows goodbye goodbye
i responded sure that sounds like fun
i will be posting an honest review on my youtube
though they agreed and here we are
we're doing a review of canvas 13 by huion
this tablet is a very affordable
one it is only 239 dollars
if you do that would be a little bit extra
all right here is the moment
we've all been waiting for
let's go cool cool here
we have the display tablet
what else do we have
we have the pen the pen
what else do we have
it is the pen display scent
um that's where you download the driver
we have the quick start guide
it's actually a good size cloth
usually with my pen tablets
so you have the power that's connects to your tablet
that's all you get in this box now
also leave a comment down below to let me know
which tablet are you using
let's look at this tablet stand
it actually fell out when i was opening everything up
so i'm just gonna see guess
this is the tallest one that it goes
obviously so we've already seen this
we can just put the pan here while we're working
i guess kind of just like go for it
go for it and put it down
so everything's starting to come together
let's finally look at the tablet
um so light so pretty
you have the buttons on one of your sides
you have the eight shortcut keys here
is this usbc to usbc cable
so setting up all of the drivers was super easy
i was very impressed with that
the pressure sensitivity worked very well as well
there were some weird blobs
i don't really have a lot of those
which is something you of course
i just had a very nice experience with this tablet
it was quite intuitive right away
um i wasn't sure what to expect
it's just you can't go wrong with that
it was truly a pleasure working with it
you know i was so surprised
it was super fun to review this tablet
Compare the 15.6 Pro with the 16
Pro is a much better deal.
Pro is fantastic as is.
First thing in the box is the tablet itself.
Twist open the pen capsule to get the pen.
The bottom serves as a stand.
This is a magic pen, no batteries, no USB charging.
I’ve scratched tablets this way.
Here is everything in the box.
The screen itself has a finish
that gets rid of the slippery, glossy feel of glass.
There is no up or down side on that cable
so plug it in whichever way its facing.
Uninstall any old tablet drivers.
If you have to uninstall something, restart your computer.
Download the correct driver - I’m using Windows.
click the desktop and go to Display Settings.
Set scale and layout to 100%.
A screen appears on your tablet.
Click the center of the red
To the side of that is Display
Express Keys is where you can program the shortcut buttons
shortcut buttons and customize pen pressure.
You can load saved settings with Import Configuration.
The tablet worked in every program
The tablet is somewhat insensitive.
But you adapt to it.
Of course the lines aren’t perfect.
In Photoshop this is great.
In SAI, when you switch to the eraser
you can’t switch back to the brush.
right, try clicking that button.
You might have been in eraser mode.
it was going to map itself to the other monitor.
Restarting the computer fixed the problem.
show only on X to get everything back.
That wraps up this review.
The XP-Pen Artist 15.6 is the best non-Wacom screen tablet
I have used so far.
Just click the “Product Reviews” button.
files and reference sheets are all available on my patreon
character renderings on the front some
but as with all of my tablet reviews
that is a boss toe
thank you card for choosing their product
stand a dust cloth and all-in-one
I found perhaps of a previous model
there should be a USB charger for the stylus pen
but this model is in fact battery free now
go straight into your laptop
and you're good to go
so this is what the boss toe 16
the front of the tablet has a very clean
look to it with all of those silvery
I have not personally before
I did have to do a cheeky awkward
reach around in order to press from
if it's going to be breaking your workflow now
it has four rubber grips on the underside
Bosto 8,192 pressure levels pen
the shape does feel a little bit chunky and dated
I did also have a cheeky
where kids need to be entertained
firstly you want to go to the
now none of this was a fault of
the tablet recognizes the pen
I do quite like this tablet size
small smooth tightly grouped buttons that you can't directly see
I did find myself using the undo button
it certainly did do the job
boster are one of the very few brands outside of
Bosto store on their Aliexpress website
I don't think that it intends to either
well done so a great big
what's going on everyone this is
so this is the tech last g30 now
I'm sure as time goes on
prices will change so definitely
take a look at the link in the video description
this is the most up-to-date pricing and
the display on here is 1080p
it's really up to your personal preference
there's no right or wrong way to use it
so you can put a micro
SD card in the tablet and dramatically expand
now there is no wireless charging at this tablet
I personally set up a ping code
it's really up to you now
the experience here gets the job done
it's not like there's really any extra
that's not a problem either
performance is very good as well
recording videos taking selfies doing different things like that
and that's not a problem either
so let's turn up the volume here
yeah so a pretty good speaker on here
that's for sure now overall
now it's not necessarily the highest quality build ever
we have a reset button
look super crisp and clear on here
the tablet is also great for browsing the web
most mobile games will work on here now
that will work call duty mobile
there's really nothing about the tech last t30 that
I don't like I like that
I hope you found to be helpful
sup cuties your favorite chocolate drink
you're having a wonderful day
yes but before we get to the tablet
give me a second to talk about my patreon
let's get back to the tablet
thanks gavin for sending me this tablet
i really have no idea if i'm saying this right
i want to make this quick and simple
so let's see what we get in the box
alright this is what you get
tablet case tablet wires pens adapters pancakes this case
i think there are no stickers
now that i think about it
well that's pretty much it now
i learned that i should not use the old laptop
so i'm still in my mom's workspace
thanks mom and downloading drivers works really easy
that was pretty hard in my last review
here are the top buttons
here i can draw pretty comfortable
i don't remember if i mentioned in the video
um so yeah that is nice
i don't remember if everything was perfectly fine
i don't wanna sit here forever
Jerez and german welcome to draw with Jazza
there is a 10% off coupon code
let's jump into the specs of this device
that's a personal favorite of mine
it's a shortcut for undo because
you open it up and inside
you have the tablet itself first underneath
you just go to the the
Heuer and website in particular
install that and it's pretty straight forward like that seemingly
I'll get to why I'm being mysterious a bit later
I'm bit of an elitist
I love my display tablets
I like drawing on the screen
it is for most digital artists
the preferable way to have a pen input
this is the first time where
I've used that a lot
that's a different book altogether
has this really nice sort of Sheen to it
they say it'll take and the point
I'm trying to make is
it was immediately really comfortable which is great
one of which is the way you draw
sometimes people like to draw from the wrist
it's almost like you're supposed to do that
it makes a huge difference
because it's entirely built around that but really
I wanted to see how this thing worked in Photoshop
the first is and will always be
you need to have a double click in your drivers
I don't know why it's not there yet
please the workaround I currently use with Hurom
so if you click and click
this is just a map
it's it's not for me personally but
I do think it's there so it's not a con
it's great if you don't like it
I knew this would be a good device
this thing is fantastic and I as a professional
I'm actually going to be using it
that sounds weird but let me explain
I have talked through this video about it
and that's me this is me
this thing is only $79.99
leave them in the comments and hopefully
go check out my videos
I've reviewed today and a whole bunch more
brushes photo references video courses and more
hey guys welcome to digit dot
this tablet is a 10 inch tablet runs on Android
the overall build of the device is functional
the display has thick black borders all around
which isn't a good thing
PPI it isn't the Christmas display
we've seen but the color reproduction looks good
even though the display was reflective we watch some
the display looks fine browsing websites and reading
however sunlight visibility of the display does suffer
there is a dialer app
which means that you can make calls from it
the typing experience on the other hand is OK
typing in portrait mode is easy for me since
the device isn't a multitasking or gaming
the device lasted for a little over 5 hours
which is below average for a tablet
so there you have it guys
that was our review of this
Alcatel 310 tablet as always
we will catch you in another video
it's good bye for now
this is the a business centric tablet that
so taking a look at the side profile
our numbers got a lot of ports
so this is where you can do
expanded storage in our internal storage
Nova will be pushed forward especially matching the same keyboard

this is a standard think that keyboard
I like is the fingerprint scanner

[Milo] Hey! That one's for me! Buddy
no, this one's for the audience.
Okay, let's just get into it
Yeah, so this is the Wacom Cintiq 16.
And it just came out, brand new in January.
But I feel like Wacom is the most recognizable brand.
two to three thousand dollars.
Which is significantly more affordable
Oh! This is the reveal.
A black box. What a reveal. Beautiful!
Here's the actual grand review.
This is the Wacom pen right here.
We have our basic power cables and wires.
We have the Cintiq itself.
And we have the pen.
Wow, I'm such a masculine man.
This is about the height that it goes at.
Which goes all the way up, like that.
That would be my preferred height, I think.
Right there. Just a quick info for you guys.
Even though it's a Wacom Cintiq 16.
The screen size is fifteen point six inches.
Oh my gosh, I just pulled something.
What? I just found this out.
This little thing in here is for your pen.
And this goes on the bottom of your Cintiq.
This is a piece I just released.
Zoom in, see how it looks.
How smooth is the response rate?
And this one is pretty nice.
You guys can see that, right?
Watch. To be absolutely honest, no technology is ever perfect
And this one, it looks really really good so far.
A lot of you guys know that
I'm religiously working on my book Nima this year.
You remember this thing right here?
Where you plug it in?
What the heck, I didn't even know that.
This is a one-stop shop.
This is like your changing nib station.
So you put it in, then you tilt it.
It's supposed to come o- woah!
And we're gonna take one to replace.
And now your nib is replaced.
Ah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
What is a Ross Draws video without some color dodge!?
Milo, what time is it?
[Milo] It's color dodge time!
Aw man, here we go.
Give me an ice attack!
Working on the new Cintiq was a lot of fun.
The response time was quick.
I worked on this in complete broad sunlight.
I've been having James stand right here as I film.
Look at all that sun.
Oh my gosh! Thanks, James. Go back. MVP.
Just enter the code ROSSDRAWS when you checkout.
There's more info on all that in my description
This one, anyone can enter, anyone around the world
Rule number one, follow Wacom on twitter.
And rule number two, answer the question of the video.
And three, lots of fresh underwear.
I love warm underwear against your skin.
It just feels so nice and clean.
I hope you enjoyed the review.
Baumann and I'll really thank them for sending me
this tablet is pretty amazing
oh and also they lay eggs
congratulations babies they fighting again recently
o plus the inside is pretty messy
I know this stuff pen pen
oh and also they should be a one tip clip
that helps the helps remove this
don't sue me come on so again now before
I can go back to my drawing
also this this is a working size of
I don't really count the inches
I think it was like $30 but it's really good
so let's let's see how
I suffer for this nice okay
I need to check it out
the test works the brush strokes
oh it works beautifully it's beautiful
this is literally my first tablet review
YouTube channel this is not Josie today
I want to do a review of this product
which i think is really worth your time
this is the vehic new graphic tablet
and it's not even like searchable on youtube yet
yeah okay yeah it is really good
I tried is the small tablet
but this one is a bigger version
they cut costs on things like packaging
and it looks definitely crappy inside but anyway who cares
CD is it this one
okay so this one is not a CD
and that's the smallest that came of it
look this one the new version
it feels a little bit of like textured plastic
you definitely don't need to charge okay
so don't be afraid like oh there's a hole
let's sing a chord okay
okay now you can see because of the lighting okay
you can't see you nicely
everything feels like one piece except right here
which is the buttons and the buttons
they did a much better job this time
there's this row of button
you'll feel the line okay
so that makes some sense to your brain okay
so you've got eight buttons
I have so far now
okay now using this time
I don't even need my keyboard shortcuts at all okay
hey yeah this this is the thought
mix-up oh no s 640
you hit a small one
I wrapped it up a paper now
let me tell you if you buy a walk on
you can do it this way or the other way
I really like is the driver
I got our that numbers killing me
okay you just need to
three tablet of the same brand together at once
it return back to normal to Center the 100% view
okay now if let's say
the lowest two is always the undo and redo buttons
that won't change none at all
it's the things that I will add
okay add color right like this
I think you can see it's very smooth
and the the the lines and stuff is very nice
very smooth the surface of this tablet
the driver a little bit better okay
I click and it becomes the eraser
it's a hand tool so
I'm totally fine with the stock settings
the lowest two is undo and redo so
I find that it actually outperform my because the shortcuts
it's a tablet review so
I'm telling you that out of my personal experience
so that's it for this
we really and hope you like it
Oh out of so many tablet
or what's your rating about this thing
I will say so far
this is my second favorite one okay
okay it's so small that
I don't need to keyboard around that
just the thing is enough for my shortcuts
okay really like that little little curve right there okay
check out the link below to get yours
we'll see you next time
i get a lot of questions from you
i haven't tried very many in my lifetime
the tablet has a screen protector
i mean look at this tiny little baby monitor
who's a cute widow's queen
it's a pretty good upgrade
all i did was go to the gaomon
wasn't that comfortable of a drawing position for me
i have seen people hold theirs while they draw
but that's just not something that i would do
but this didn't seem to really fix the issue
i think because i'm used to working a little larger
but that's it for this one
bye guys you wanna draw on the tablet
uh you get the itty bitty tablet
it's the end of the video
Hey guys, how's it going!
Today, we're doing a Tablet review.
And they gave me this..
Artist 12 tablet to give my honest review with.
Without further ado, let's do it.
Hey guys, so this is what XP-Pen gave me.
It looks really nice, clean, modern and also the stand.
The stand that comes with it.
Ooo you see my reflection?
Hi. So this is what it looks like
Let's see. What else is in here.
Look at all this stuff.
These are different power adapters depending on where you live.
Whoa, it has a hexagon shape to it.
I think it's better for holding maybe.
We'll test it out later.
Ooooo, check how shiny it is!
Looks like it has some buttons here.
Kind of diffuses it, so that's the anti-glare film.
I'm just gonna take it off.
Oh! I'm using it backwards.
And let me put this on here.
Yeah, so the stand is about forty to fifty dollars.
You buy these together, you save a bit of money.
I think around 20 bucks, so, nice.
I'm gonna use my laptop to paint.
I feel like this is the Matrix.
I figured this out, guys.
XP-Pen We managed to power it up.
Let's see what my art looks like.
Wow, I actually really like the color.
So this is the piece I have for us today.
A way that I love testing out
tablets is with the details.
So I have this painting here
I really like to go in
So I'm gonna try that.
It looks pretty good on screen.
I think that's kind of funny.
Maybe her pet dragon could have a little tongue.
This is before what I did, and this is after.
And you can tell that there's a lot more detail.
That's the ultimate test that I love to do.
I'll probably finish this on my own time.
Sun-kissed at the beach with her pet dragon.
Milo, what do you think? Do you like it?
The XP-Pen Artist 12, I believe it retails for $250.
Just to give a comparison.This
One of my highlights is the glove!
I absolutely loved this glove.
It was like so smooth.
I barely even noticed it was there.
This is not a mobile computer.
This is strictly a tablet and a second monitor
And of course, there's a giveaway!
So I have two Artist 12 tablets.
So you have two chances to win.
Rule number one, follow XP-Pen on Twitter.
Maybe it's an ice world with flying polar bears everywhere.
Any last words you wanna say?
Huh? Do you breathe fire?
I hope this review was helpful for you guys.
Aww Milo. Looking forward to the giveaway.
hi this is a review of the ug 2150
I haven't bought anything from gearbest
they've just sent this to me
a display tablet is slightly different to your drawing tablet
what's slightly better than Huey on you
it wasn't very big files
I've installed that it's worked very well
it's worked well in all programs
the build quality seems quite good
the screen is very shiny
so there's a fair bit of glare
the pen squeaks really slightly
I don't really find it much of a problem
it's very very similar to the huion
some people have talked about pen
I don't notice a massive difference
don't get me wrong the
you can see me doing a sketch here
I think it's exceptionally good
I really like the big screen
that's one thing it really has over the
they are that little bit better
which does make a difference to your workflow
okay hope there helps and write in the comments
today the share popularity of tablet is decreasing
yes because of today's smartphones
the screen size is also getting bigger
well this is the Xperia z4 tablet
which is the last tablet series from
yes a lot of noise is still very visible
the u.s. still use experienced
UI exactly the same as the Xperia smartphone
thanks to the large screen
that it's 10-inch yes from browsing
thanks to the large screen size
then it is also supported by front-facing stereo speaker
the score from the antutu benchmark is around 100 thousand
we talked a little about this
it isn't too bad we're in heavy
it is still long enough to feel until full
its take run to till 3 hours
it is still able to run well
its performance is still quite responsive and smooth
it is still not ok for heavy gaming okay
see you and thank you
I'm sorry for my bad english thank you
i'm going to review the gaomon
it's really good all right
that's actually a review unit from gaomon
it's priced around you as 70
so this are the items included in the box
we have this usb cable
this is made with some thick felt like material
there is no pen stand
it has a nice rubber grip here
it's quite similar to my 15.6 inch laptop
except it's not that thick of course it's much thinner
and here at the side
you can see a little sleeve here
this is for holding the pen
so you can slide it in like this
make it comfortable for you to rest
there are five above the touch
all these physical shortcut buttons
they have very nice feedback to them
this tablet can also work with windows
the driver for mac and windows
they are essentially similar except with the windows driver
you just have to press this button
i'm just using the default mapping
i have with the mango s
driver is when i start my mac
this is the line quality test now
this pen is very sensitive
um it's really good now with minibank paint pro
that's the only issue i discovered during testing
the drawing texture here it's a matte surface texture
it's not like slippery as if you're drawing on glass
the performance is very consistent and predictable
i have tested the tablet with photoshop
you can have tilt and pressure looking working together
this app that i'm using this is krita
i'm using the usbc adapter
no driver installation is required
it's going to be disorienting
it's mapping this horizontal working area to a vertical canvas
you can expect fantastic drawing performance drawing performance on android
it's very accurate overall drunk experience
it's pretty good by the way right now
i have links for you in the video description below
I got my hands on the new 2019
during which time I haven't had any issues whatsoever
it's very comfortable and a very nice design
I also love the extra nibs hidden inside the pen
it is worth mentioning that
the hand-eye coordination takes some time to get used to
we're looking at the medium size graphics tablet.
Now these new Intuos 4 tablets have increased sensitivity
you're getting 2048 levels of Pressure Sensitivity
now there are eight express keys down the side here
[and] These have tiny little OLED screens
We have a selection button and a rotation ring here
And you can create shortcuts on screens of various tools
if you're using photoshop for example
Which goes in like so on your desk?
nibs that [you] can use with the tablet now
I think is the best buy
Which tell you what the express keys are doing
thanks very much for listening
come back soon and check out more reviews on geek
the pen is working really well
and it's quite responsive once you get used to
Full HD 1080p rear facing webcam
that sounds really great here
this full-size backlit and spill resistant
and on the right it has a second
that's all for now and thank you for watching
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
this has none of those issues
it's actually pretty well built
it's got a metal case on the back here
it feels rather solid and pretty nice in the hand
button here to load up your
it's got the full version of
10 Home Edition built in fully licensed
the updates for it took forever so plan accordingly
you do have a card
slot for a micro SD card
you have the speaker output speakers
so you can plug in a standard
it didn't work on here
so that's probably his biggest limitation
here is the fact that it doesn't have a second
the battery on here in light usage
I think you're going to get about seven hours
there are two cameras on here
the back camera is a 5 megapixel camera
I'll pull up the stats bernhard
the color on the display
I did a video on that a little while ago
you can see down below in the video description now
it comes in much slower and
so you're not going to get any of the newer
we looked at just last week
lenovo mix 320 that one came in around 20
the margin of error here is about the same
I would expect it to and again
Word here running on it
just fine is installed just like any other
I've got a Bluetooth keyboard
trackpad attached this thing is from
Logitech I bought this about two or three years ago
it's great especially for computers that lack ports
I can get an all-in-one keyboard trackpad combo here
most of them might cost the same
we're just about the same as the computer
does itself so this keyboard trackpad combo
sometimes it does a little better
okay on here some do better than others
be book v3 ultra book
I looked at a couple of weeks ago
and what's nice about this too
they only give you like 90 days
so that's a good thing to have here battery
life seems acceptable for the price point
I like the build quality
I think you'll be fine
might you'll definitely need that
there are many pen tablets out there in the market.
there is wacom and other lesser known brands.
let's check this one out.
I saw the box and its quality
the box was very well designed and built
and you might ask me
more on this in the video ahead
the pen feels very light.
this was truly the only remaining feature which
the pen is battery free
but the tablet of course is wired
hey the pen supports the industry
erasers top as erasers at all.
oh wow look at that
the pen holder holds the pen
they already have some keys mapped on them
yes it has definitely fought many battles and won.
we had literally no complaints when we used it on
nothing else but don't get me wrong
there are still a good options from back home
the light-handed pressure strokes came out
mm jack on every goddamn gadget they release
exuberant here from you for this feature
it is right there with this pen
tablet for free it is optional
definitely not the swimming pool
you're using you can edit
that's who you on did
I think it's going to be a very good deal
Facebook pages and they are really helpful
they are very nice people
that's all for today MuBot out.
this is a new model for 2017
it's like 95% the same as a last model
so this is the $79 version
got your apps in the home screen
it's actually a pretty nice tablet
I mean the build quality feels solid
sports 256 gigabyte cards so has a quad-core 1.3
gigahertz processor it is pretty zippy
it's definitely a speed improvement
RAM so yeah the speed
it is pretty smooth to operate
I don't know why you'd really use them a lot
get rid of the reflections
OS layout got the apps
you can move stuff around
I like about the tablet
it does seem seem pretty solid so the storage options
this is a 16 gigabyte model
so it's got about twelve point to four usable
at one point they had the option a while ago
it's really easy so this is actually the app
the audio gets kind of weird sometimes but
takes like five minutes just installing a couple apps
I got a different tutorial
got all their stuff on here
you can use tuning radio
they have a good selection apps
you can't really like move files with it or anything
it's kind of limited so of course you've got
Amazon's videos on here you got Prime videos
Alexa the virtual assistant features
you can have different tasks done in here so
I'm not going to go into detail with that
Amazon this whole bunch of different Alexa skills
this thing called word runner
it's like a different way to read
where only shows you one word at a time
it's actually a really different way to read
I got a different video for that
it's obviously something that's not available on the
it wasn't on by default
you got some different font choices
what do we talked about display
so there's this adaptive brightness
I kept fluctuating all the time
I really didn't like it had to turn that off
there's another cool like accessibility features in here
Vantage's for those with vision problems
we've also got like the lockscreen pin
you can like use this high contrast mode
and here's two kind of weird okay
check out the e-book reader comm for some additional info
thank you guys and have a good day
hey what's going on guys
i'm ryan welcome back to the channel
welcome back to another video
hope you guys are doing absolutely fantastic today
in this video let's have a look at this teclast
so here's the box t-pads tech list
that's my old t-class t-10 over there
there's not much to it
oh yeah you can see a few specs here
capacity 6 thousand milliamps an hour
tablet is not too bad
we have this box here with goodies
let's have a look what's inside
yeah basically just the charger here
you guys can see the specs
it's not the fastest charger in the world for
there's this theme removal tool remember
let's do a walk around the tablet so you here
you can see the screen protected from fracture
aluminium finish tecla's size is metal
the rock button charging port
we have the stereo speakers
so you guys can see there on the side
you have the sim card tray you can use
two sim cards or one sim card
plus a micro sd card 64 or 128 gigs
there and at the bottom we have the microphone there
yeah overall i think it does look good looks
i do like that detail
so let's turn it on
and straight out of the box
let's check the about and as advertised
we can see it here
and there you go guys android version
here you have the night light
i'm not sure if you guys can see
i'm going to lower the brightness of the tablet
we can see the eight cores
the arm cortex a55 running at 1.6 gigahertz and here
the 5 gigahertz band is supported battery
we have a temperature of 23 degrees for the battery
let's have a look what we can do
let's for example run netflix and first thing first
let's have a look at the max resolution
this one is not google certified
it doesn't have the google white vine level one
let's play some titles here
another thing of this ui is if you exit netflix
hopefully you guys can see it clear
we still have the screen protector there
yeah not too bad guys
let's try pubg mobile the graphics
we're playing with standard graphics
have a look smooth medium classic
i think it's pretty responsive
i mean for the price of this unit
this is how this double sounds like
this is the back camera recording 720p
max so it's not the best to be honest
single core score and multi score score
i keep finding nice stuff on this
i think this is quite nice and handy
another thing i find helpful
i think this is a nice tablet
especially for the price octa-core 4 gigs of ram 64
yeah i think it's a good unit
please don't forget to subscribe to the channel
thank you very much for your support
so I've been sent some more free stuff
this is the week a 50 graphics tablet
I do like that size
I don't like anything smaller
I think it's nice and thin
it's got your buttons on the side
it's very similar really to most in the price range
it specially looks slightly quicker response time
so maybe there's that bit faster
the big players seem to be huion you
interestingly week apparently are set up by people from new
so you'll be supporting me
its gesture control is fine
I suppose gestures a bit quicker the wheel actually
it'll be a bit awkward especially in blender
have you will aim left but with this
it wasn't a big problem just every time
you're a funny line but to be honest
the only problem for me is that
I didn't notice any squiggling lines
I don't notice much between them
the drivers work without any problems
the programmer the buttons were good
I would probably say this is my favorite now
well done with the graphics tablet
it's great and thank you for watching
so we finally have it
the best budget tablet is here
and what are we getting
it has a fully laminated gorilla
glass covered full hd screen
but what else do we have
you can currently buy so it comes in this
not that most people mind
they're passing the savings on to us
it's very slow to charge this
so we've got a three megapixel camera here now
i am sure of it
i will be testing it out
though so power button and volume up and down now
these are made out of plastic and shaking it
there's no rattling or anything like this
so this alloy here has a matte finish to it
which is great considering the price
yes they're about a thumbnail kind of width there
and what about the width of the tablet
you'll find two loudspeakers here
they're not high quality loud speakers
right here we've got a 3.5 millimeter out headphone jack
with okay average kind of quality
we have a very good screen in this
i did not expect it to be number one
it is covered with gorilla glass
it's 16 by 10 aspect ratio
it's starting to then change
so that's just one very minor little bug
this screen is really good
it's just google apps you get with this one now
it's actually performing better than i expected
the four gigabytes of ram is helping recent app tabs
here too very smooth with this
sometimes we'll get a little bit of slow down now
i've got nova launcher installed here
this is really silly to have this in there
i installed that when i took this screenshot here
internal storage speeds quite slow
so this is one area that okay
they've had to save a bit of money
cutting the costs not particularly fast
does it bottleneck the system
it doesn't actually feel like it does really
i'm not seeing any slowdown from the storage
slow random writes there with this one
this is a low score
look at the weak area
well away from my router
time is very slow for this tablet
it's about like three hours almost to fully charge
so it's not particularly good gpu gps performance
where a house is so not amazing gps
you'll get the orders top and bottom here
this is one of my own videos
so it's running on the youtube sitting here at 1080p
60 frames per second and it is flawless
no starter no lag no problems
have the sim cards in there
i recommend using a headset for this
otherwise you have to use the microphone
my mobile phones are getting as well
it is loud is it the highest quality
the same goes for the loudspeakers here
these loudspeakers actually have a good volume
is google play books okay and this is quite fast
you don't actually see this
it does look very good for pdf files now
the screen is looking pretty
that is a lot lighter
a light engine for example like mobile legends perfectly
fine smooth nice and playable no problems there
good gamma and good touch response
your phone will have much better gps than this tablet
i don't think it can be beaten
now it does come with that con
the gpu is rather weak and the chipset
that's not a huge lemon
it's a more premium model
it's the huawei mate pad pro
it's jc and a while ago
and we're gonna we're gonna try this out today
let's just get into it
the tablet came with this really swanky looking protective sleeve
the packaging is super super nice
i felt really fancy opening it up
thank you for choosing me humon
the tablet itself is really lightweight and thin
that's because check this out ready ready
there's my sanic i'm very proud
um but you know what i think
i want to draw something else now
the stylist has a really nice feeling grip to it
i had one of these from another brand
i didn't know it opened up
i was pretty impressed with all the packaging
stand compared to my wacom pen
stand the base is really really small
and it's lightweight and made of plastic
these styluses have been through worse
the humon driver was super easy to set up
i tried it out with my laptop
i didn't need to calibrate anything
it just worked cool beans
you know what they say
it's not the size of the tablet
no i'm not gonna make that joke
drawing on this tablet felt really natural
it has a nice texture to it
the pen pressure is good
this is a good choice
so that's why i'm telling you also real quick
i just want to mention
that's also compatible with this tablet
i really hope you enjoy the comic
it's deeply personal to me
but finding your way back
thank you so much for watching
i hope that this video was helpful
there's a button for that too
i guess but please let me know in the comments
let me know that too
so finally another tablet review from me
I know a lot of you are saying
well what's going on with all those mobile reviews
where are the tablets where the laptops they're coming
so this is tech last new flagship
it's definitely a lot smoother
the dual sim support from the previous model
the screen is 10.1 inches
protector that's outlining all the specs
start asking questions so the charger we get
time is a little slow
it's not particularly long this cable either
so we're going to five megapixel camera right up here
at the top the bezels are relatively large
there is a pogo port
it's not actually out so unfortunately
I don't have it maybe later on
it scratched our camera on
the rear is autofocus eight megapixels
a very tiny poor sensor nothing amazing
this is our sim tray
SIM door micro SD card type
shame we've got right here a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
but it's not the best audio quality
do it a lot better
okay and then volume rocker right here
so this is made out of plastic
the feel of this button is okay
it doesn't rattle anything like that
so that is good a little reset button here
we've got two speakers up with firing
there will be a sample in this review
wait a little bit heavier
so let's talk about the ROM performance
it has improved okay so multitasking
we're all a little bit choppy
this still isn't perfect okay
I wanted to demonstrate to you
I can't just suddenly flick and have it
scroll down to the bottom
now whether that's the touch digitizer it probably actually is
there's an application called screen filter
maximum brightness will quickly show
you comes right up here to that
we're not seeing a warm white
that actually seems to be pretty good
that's what it's 50% brightness
ok jumping now onto the ROM
a game will take that
look at just how it's performing so what
I used to swipe up like that
we're still seeing some of that
that definitely would take last
Android 10 on this tablet ever
they will probably just push out the tick last
we have a depth of brightness
ok not good so that means
Netflix is and standard definition
you will not have full
HD ever probably on this tablet
I see this a lot with Chinese tech
they don't really care about that
this is a step up over the old
I don't know why it says real me v
I have had a couple of dropped connections
I don't believe the range of this tablet
I think on the kind of router you have
accuracy of two meters now
GPS but it actually works
I've placed only eight minutes of phone
last t30 is pretty good
I'll give you a sample here
I found with some games
but here's just a quick sample this
see that actually sounds all right
that sounds better than the tick last t20
this is a very large PDF
the performance is a lot better
so it's gonna be fine for e-books a gaming performance
and it's actually really quite playable a big step up
I use my football probe and checked
it was up to 38 degrees
I was that initially standing right
what you're listening to is
I won't even bother with a sample
it's not really a priority you can see
I've teclast to install amazing wonderful high quality cameras
okay so just to recap
I'll start with the positives
we've got a very good gaming performance for the spec
Shadowgun with a lot of stutters a lot of lag
they give us and get kills in fact
they ended up winning that round of a battle
royale there which was good and something
then of course we've got voice calls text messages
it's solid and then the battery life really really good
you will struggle to kill this battery in a day
that is really really good
Chrome as you saw when I tried to
so the touch response then need some optimization
revision app is missing no DRM level 1 cert
not the tablet for it
it's just still not perfect
ok you don't see major
firmware software updates like a jump from 9 to 10
that's not going to come through with these
G better of course but 5g not so great there
so thank you so much for watching this tablet review
this is Lisa from mobile tech reviewer
look it's the black surface pro right
no this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet third generation
if you remember it was considerably smaller and considerably weirder
yeah it's it's kind of great
the kickstand now has two positions
so you're not so limited in your use
we have the full court
so you've got a lot more horsepower
we're going to talk about it now
you are core i7 dish 8650 or your choice there
Ram 8 or 16 gigs
and that is soldered on board
take the back cover up to upgrade it
there's a bunch of little tiny
it has a quadruple a battery inside
that refers to this is rechargeable
not the one that we got no charging port
this is latest wakame es generation with tilt support
though again you might have trouble
obviously this is a very thin
it's no place to put this in a silo
so what they give you
this is it doesn't have a USB a port
is your little ink pen pink
I don't think that it's gonna break off
it's gotten a little bit heavier since last generation
they weigh about 2.8 pounds
when you're talking about lenovo
CPU we have the core i5 model again
the clock speeds is consistent across the top
performance is nice on this
CPU but I rarely heard it
which usually isn't the case with lenovo ultrabooks
so that was pretty impressive
the back will get warm
that's used on the surface products and HP spectre x360
line in terms of the pressure curves
it's certainly a good pen experience
so surface pro is notoriously
the trackpad is pretty good
Pro though is the fact
hello camera yeah not often
they try it out with previous x1 tablets
that's gone because Thunderbolt 3
LTE module on the side
good for people who are working outdoors
obviously it's got some glare
well the only drawback here is battery
but you know that's an okay capacity
is that kind of average not too bad
the performance is good on this
it's really runs quiet as well
I'm really impressed with how it keeps
Pro Challenger in that respect
where the displays are a little lackluster
this one has really good
metrics is keenly bright the keyboard
it is the drawback is just
you're gonna need a USB a adapter for example
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
display tablet the Galman pd 1161
they sent it to me for free but as usual
i'm here to tell you my honest opinion about it
this video is also a giveaway
display tablet is incredibly affordable
this is among the most affordable ones
there don't have a lemonade screen
I just wanted to let you know this
I can't stress enough about how much I love them
which makes you look a little bit funny
the tablet comes with a film over the screen
protector that you have to peel off
it was very satisfying to do it
when you remove it the screen becomes matte
I must say to install the tablet
download the driver and install it from here
it's annoying pass the calibration
it's quite useless because it doesn't really work
if you try to calibrate your pen things gets worst
so just don't ever calibrate it just an advice
I also have to say that
the tablet and the pan
I was ready to start but first off
I have to say that
I need a new computer
I know anyway as you might know
I got a little bit of performance anxiety
maybe by the way if you're wondering
I didn't want to start any other
I didn't put much effort into it anymore
that's why the eyes look kind of weird
it's crazy and even if that
Talbot came with a stand
you don't need to spend more
this one is good enough
I get mad over the Cintiq
do you like me posting digital art or you
don't care about it because yeah anyway
you can get this on amazon
we have a thank you card
we have our sim ejector tool
we have some manuals here here
so here is the tablet itself
it's got a nice protector on the screen here
it's got a good weight to it
you don't have to really charge it up
there's really not a lot of range to the sound
it use 7.58 gigs of 32 gigabytes
it doesn't have any face
id or anything like that you need to use you
know like a pattern or a pin to unlock it
no lag here looks pretty good
you can play up to 1080p youtube videos netflix
anything like that and the quality looks really good again
today's news scrolls pretty good
don't really see any lag here
seems to be working pretty good
everything on the screen is nice and clear and crisp
the brightness is at about 54 percent
so now we've got some games installed
we are playing some asphalt graphics
i didn't notice any lag
uh graphic settings set as high as
it'll go right now so here we see
we can only use balanced
so we'll go ahead and hit okay
it doesn't look too bad
the game is definitely playable
uh you saw i killed a couple people again
the graphics are stuck at a certain level
mobile looking smooth so far graphics aren't too horrible
we are in a little multiplayer match
this will go into our settings here
we'll see what the graphics are set at so graphics
you're going to be able to play call of duty
here's some video quality from the rear camera
i noticed for the camera
quality for the rear camera is actually pretty good
also isn't that bad either
there is definitely a little bit of lag here now
it's definitely got a built quality
it doesn't feel like it's going to break so build
quality is definitely good battery life
it's got pretty good battery life as you saw
quality is also really good
keep purchasing products to do reviews to you guys so
thank you guys for watching
hey everyone in today's video
I'm going to review the deco
XP pen in this video
what the driver can do
and of course the drawing performance
yes this tablet actually supports
Android version 6 in addition to Mac OS and Windows
this is not powered by battery
so you do not need to charge it
it's not too light and it's not too heavy
stand the bottom here and here this is
Robert it has a very good grip on the table
so this is the tablet
the smaller model it's 9 by 5 inches
I will consider a medium to large size
the smaller model is $40 cheaper at u.s. $89
if you are new to graphic tablets well
XP pen cost is the virtual wheel
and when you tap on it this will register
they will also light up
I like the clean and simple design
it's very thin and you can see this part here
this part here is matte plastic
the buttons they have reef feedback on the back
nice very solid and now
Windows is a very straightforward installation
you can just a pressure curve
I like this compared to those slider
this is not very useful
he just shows you the monitor you are using
you can use this tablet with dual screens as well
there is actually the functionality
this is the mapping area
you should choose reset customer
this is quite convenient and now
let's test out the drawing performance
lines and thick lines when you press down really hot
we just the lines they come out just the way
the drawing performance of this tablet
they work really well except for
it works really well and this pen
it's really sensitive very responsive
this is very convenient for changing brush
I'm not going to show you all the apps today
it's really quite satisfying to draw on this tablet
so it's not too slippery
well let's just say that this pen
this is one that I can recommend very easily
let's check out the tooth sensitivity
the darker is on the left side
they give you different versions
I have it on tablet PC and my pressure
it's located here at the bottom left
this is a still me me max
3 with a really huge screen
so let me open up our flow
no driver installation is required
installation is required for this tablet to work with
the line quality you can get
they can't choose that we are 1m2
I'm quite impressed by this
I'm happy to say that this works pretty well too
see you in the next video bye
hello everyone welcome to my channel
my name is Jackson in this video
I'll be showing you guys
I'm assuming also serves as a pen
holder table has a decent weight
I think they work like Express keys
we have the stylus individually wrapped similar to tablet
I think it's supposed to help you do that
you need instructions on how to
you need to connect the tablet to the computer
this tablet uses a USB port
the pen has like over 300
so that's pretty much everything that's in the box
I have my own PEM tablet
I'm showing you on the left
I've had for ages anyway
the tablet is on its default settings
I didn't mess around with it too much
this was a bit jarring because
I got used to it pretty quickly
D tablet was working pretty
well is pretty functional as you can see
the colors are going down quite nicely
the speed felt really good like really natural
I liked the surface up a tablet
I got into the painting
it seems to be the case with most tablets
I finished a bit more all right
how this is turning out actually
it never really worked out before but today
I did forget to mention you
and it's like there's so many of them like honestly
the drying process was very very smooth
I think I'll get this tablet
it has all the things that tablet needs to have
it will do the job perfectly fine
this offer was indeed very validating haha
anyway thank you guys for watching and as always
Veeck VK 1560 it's brand-new pen display
this product was provided to be by
Veeck or maybe it's pronounced VK
so what is this thing
it's a pen display basically
pop up over the last year
it's a really nice size to draw
it's not too small it's like the
our adjustment buttons along the back of the device
what on earth does that mean
I wouldn't be surprised if we see that
the screen itself has a film on it
if you really wanted to
you could take it off
it has a standard release
lets you set it at any angle
I've never seen that before
so tell me more about this pen you keep talking
it's pretty comfortable to hold
it's very comfortable in the hand
there are also two buttons along the sides
the pen is also battery free
the pressure of the pen itself feels pretty good
well fast hats lines do well
I'm not getting any fish
this is where we get to my favorite boogeyman
like how do you define what is acceptable
I'd put this device somewhere in the middle
just use a stroke straightener all the time
I often do even appropriate
there is a downside to doing this
the line tends to lag behind the pen tip
when you draw with a stroke
straightener turned on the higher
you set the stroke straightener
I do have to draw quickly or faster lines
I thought it was a good screen
those are some of the better things about it
I look at all of the other devices out
there that are in this category
I think I've reviewed five of them now
and of course as always i
i've ranked these on my website
i think there are just other devices
that just have a better pen to them
that's a little bit more expensive
that doesn't have that problem
hey guys so in today's video
I have a tablet review for you
I'm just going to tell you my honest opinion
I think of it so first
well if you know me you know
the size of it is kind of like a safe
but it's not too big or too small
the plastic is this lightweight kind of plastic
it is just a very light tablet and so
I kind of like that about it
so the pen pressure is 8,192 levels of pressure
the pressure has to be used great
I know that sounds strange
but there's some tablets that are very stiff
I just recorded the screen with a camera
just bear with me as you can see
I'm working a higher resolution which I usually do
if there's still that reoccurring problem okay
yeah that's a pretty big downside to me
it didn't have that same problem
I would recommend this tablet since it is sturdy
I think this tablet would be pretty good for you
it is a pretty affordable price $90
it feels very well on the pressure
everything is perfect about it except for that smoothness feature
I hope it was okay
just you know two extra videos that speak cool beans
okay text you later bye
Caesar Brutus is just as cute a Caesar can't Brutus
Caesar people totally like Brutus
just as much as they like
Caesar and what did it become
I'm reviewing the Delmont PD
I was like yes yes I will
you got a connect personal computer
the box comes with the display
a pen it stands nibs a glove and the cables
okay going to help a tablet works
this tablet is pretty big
it doesn't become completely flat
the stand is thick and sturdy
so you're able to put some body weight onto it
I mentioned earlier for how the tablet works
I'm comparing it to the other tablets
I've used which are a few
I've used the welcome in to us
it makes me feel secure
so that saved me like two hours
I didn't notice a lag or anything
I'm glad my main programs are supported in the speedpaint
the process of adjusting was explaining the meaning emails
they're really efficient on the site
okay so coming to price
I'm so old I am mature
I really love the size
oh you showed me kindness
Gama for sending me this and goodbye
maybe 8 gig or 16 gig
I'm not really sure you have some live wallpapers
you can launch some random random stuff you have email
the high looks the only difference with the Galaxy
so let's check it out
yeah we're on my own home
so this is a capacitive touchscreen
it's you don't need to
how does it work like this
I'm not very used to capacitive
let's go on another website here
I'm going to type in tech name did I click
I hope it's not mobile
let's click carrot just the random article article
so how fast is this then
this is just just a video
oh there's an article here like this
you watched him cost billions
had what's the address of
I'm not used to capacitive
I told you already so
let's let's watch one or two videos
come back this in kind of
they have widget as well the way they did
we can output this to HGTV
and it's there and then there's some Facebook installed Facebook
that's the cool thing about seven inch
oh yeah you want to see how it looks
check it out the design of this and
so it's better to have that like something
which is the picture as a background
you can try some games later
well you've seen them already dad you wanted to see
I looks it's really thin huh
there's a power switch like so you can charge
it's really fast at a power plug
Coulomb let's quickly connect the HDMI
I go and switch to TV
TV so easy I click here can resume
let me exit this again
it's not super for reading and all this time
I had a bunch of things running in the background
you can just stuff everything
let me get faster oops what happened
so they're working on the Android 2.2 firmware
hopefully it's going to be released like forever very soon
but actually this sound is muted for some reason
I don't know what why it's muted
we'll just make sure you're not burning your background
I push that very easy all right
so that's it for this first video
300 grams and it's good
price is 249 euros to $75 then
this is this is what's what you get
I think it can fit in a jacket pocket
yeah huge huge internet in the pocket experience
thanks for watching this video
hello everybody those of you
I'm gonna go over everything that comes with the tablet
let's move on to the review now with this tablet
the tablet does include the integrated intel graphics 620
AM you do have an integrated multi
array set of 3 microphones
this is better than the surface
the trackpad does support multi gesture so that is great
the keys are also very good
I actually enjoyed typing on this keyboard
so nothing much to say there
meerkats know that you get in display
now let's talk about the options for the screen
I recommend going with the 3k by 2k LED screen
I mentioned the front facing camera now
I'm gonna talk about the back facing camera
I didn't like about this kickstand
it's easy to lift ok now
looking at the top of the tablet
you don't have much on top
you're looking for the left side of the tablet
you do have your combo headphone and mic 3.5
and next right here is where your nano
details new accounts can be created
front and back cameras are included
4 le accelerometer and gyroscope extensors
almost everything in this package is geared toward making money
you may prefer to simply buy this cheaper version
Amazon claims it is more rugged than the iPad Mini
7 is for media consumption
it does have its down site fire
Android overtalk ultimately the Amazon
Hi everybody, how are you?
Without further ado, let’s get to it!
So this is the box
where it came, and inside we’ll find; the tablet
Let’s check some of the other stuff.
First let’s see how it performs on the computer though.
So here are the drivers.
Let’s go to where it says
the tablet wouldn’t detect the shortcuts
the new shortcuts should work.
Let’s move onto the pen.
On the bottom box we can check that
On Work Area, if you are using only one monitor
Let’s make some quick tests with different programs.
Oh, a wild Kai has appeared!
and it'll tell you how to do it.
the pressure didn’t seem to work
Paint the pressure was much more precise.
obviously, about 25x16 cm (10x 6 inches).
Kind of the usual medium sized tablet.
as what we’d find on a wacom
but not too much so don’t freak out.
The buttons for the shortcuts work
fine, both the tablet and then pen’s.
that might require that option
Saying "I’m impressed" would be an understatement.
The Android mode, I think it’s great!
The Intuos pro medium are of a similar size yet
they cost around 250 euros
So the verdict is; a very very nice tablet!
so you don’t miss out any new videos.
See you soon and take care ♥
let's find out very cool
a allow freebies check that out
awesome um this last shirt
let's get this thing open
actually that's one of the buttons on the side
i'm sure that's on off switch
do you have a secondary on compartment
this definitely has some weight to it as well
this is a note changer
just um cooking up your space there
until next time gamer you
I love trying out new art materials
this tablet comes with the tablet itself
a pen a pen holder
8 replacement nibs a USB
the working area is 10 inches
I really liked the size of the tablet
how it's a little longer than the typical tablet
I also really enjoyed how lightweight yet sturdy
how this tablet has the ability to go wireless
the pen on the screen also felt good
the lines just worked and flowed so working with Photoshop
felt quite natural to me
it was just one quick swirl of the dial so
my final little struggle was that
I'm used to making the button on my pen
I couldn't program a keystroke plus a mouse
click for the pen button so instead
I think this is a great option
hey all care OS reviews
the concept here was inspired by the boogie
it's actually soft and malleable
but you can't make as light marks on this one
I'm done with this if I wanted to erase it
well completely you race it as you can see there
the erase function here is pretty cool
you have 30 seconds to you erase
I can tap on this
Manute elements that you've drawn on
it's not just smudging the paper
you have to use the eraser tip here
it's kind of easy to make marks on this one
it's a bit prone to accidental markings
if you're not careful which is why
there are no magnets on the back of this model
I can tap on the race
you race also doesn't work that's pretty much it
the premise here is very much simple
it's a replacement for paper and finally
they were actually pretty expensive
I think that it's kind of an underrated technology
can you get a good
Windows 10 experience on the device
it feels quite a robust tablet
you know it's not the most premium feeling tablet
there's quite a lot of expandability options on the tablet
when you are looking at it head-on now look here
it's really the web browsing here
let me just actually do something here
you know but nothing special really they could also
I think you've improved the brightness there
it's not the brightest display
it should be able to handle that pretty well
this is a solid tablet
the frugal tack welcome to my channel this
now after checking out different tablets
tablets are rebranded with the same exact specs
A that's a samsung galaxy
I saw available the Samsung Tab Lite II
that is not a galaxy tablet okay

hello and welcome to a new video
I'm here to review my XP pen star
it cost me just shy of 60 euros
it's twice the size of my old
since you can just rebind it to whatever you need
the tablet itself has 8 hotkeys
I had to do specifically to make it work in
I personally regret is not buying a protector
who's looking for a tablet so yeah
I'm just gonna go over the specs again
it is six by ten inch or ten by six
that doesn't need to be recharged
it comes with like eight nibs by default
Hansol hand to brush to erase
so that's what I suggest you do
I'm currently using it on a Windows
tablet sales are no questions slowing down and Samsung themselves
haven't even updated some their other flagship
tablets they no pro in
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
how much thinner can these things get
Samsung has finally incorporated an aluminum bezel
and it's a nice touch
it's about the experience and the little details like this
Samsung gets rid of the IR blaster
now moving through the right side very cliquey power
SD card slot with the tab
I'm sure due to engineering constraints
on the left hand side
it's no problems at all
it is plastic with an aluminum paint light texture
the fine letters are just not as crisp
wow factor but the resolution is still done well
so yes those heavy into watching movies and widescreen formats
Samsung is not using their latest processor
4 the Exynos 5433 indeed
it is still no slouch either
another feature is from the home page
you can swipe left in
I ran two movies and then the following day tested
some games downloaded some more apps
here and of course left the tablet on standby overnight
I was shocked that Samsung did not advance on
it's a great design but when you compare
I'm Jimmy wood Jim's review room
hey everyone welcome back to another video in this video
this is 100% my own opinion of the product
so let's take a look inside
shall we alright so first thing
next is a pen that does not require a battery
and that's what's in the case
there's also a special edition tablet
you see me doing here and so
Wacom pen tablet or even better
it has the same drying space as the
and it's by far much more affordable plus
well that a normal pen tablet should do so
they will save you life
they did me a lot of time
so that's what I did
so if your if you'd like to purchase the tablet
I'll leave a link in the description box below
and if you'd like the shirt
I'll also leave a link to that as well
I have to say about this pen tablet
I'm going to go and check this out
this is actually the tablet that we have here
and the back of it
this tablet can work with micro
this is actually the very very force start of that
we have some ups here
we have camera actually kids desktop
we can exit this by going here
we just exited the kids login there
we also have grown-ups only so 5 plus 19
this is the official system of the tablet
we have also half please two as well so guys
we can download our own apps and up here
we can download whatsapp we can do with Facebook Instagram
i wanna so when you go to a one
we can play with these children apps
if you want to go out we can go back
so that's the beauty that I like about this
I am going to go to the settings
I'm going to look for that
so that's the model number
the processor type is quite cool
it's you know better than most tablet
I hope that this was helpful
you can see here the the this is the new
F cos 43 internet tablet
which is the newest compact pocket-sized full
the latest on cortex a8 45
PMP with the Wi-Fi connection inside
and then this one came in 2006
they actually have the same screen size
this diaper touch is actually
it's an iPhone but it's the same iPod Touch
and you see you get a bigger screen
let me just turn it on like this right here
I don't know it works something like that
I'm a kind of a slow ruler
let's go to and gadget type
something else drug intervention no
I don't need that and gadget all right
if you're close enough you can maybe see that
it's actually readable in full full
Corning is fast and it's totally readable
you don't need like some super crazy
so it's gonna load the share folder
it should load or at least before
I was doing it through the phone
yeah there's a list of like
I can have access to 2 terabytes of the movie
so there's built in 16 gigs
you can add a microSD and there's HDMI output that
it went from 42 percent to 99 99 percent charging
it took like less an hour so
this speaker is free now and then you can play
some 3d games branches 3d games
does everybody else say they're not pretty good
I'm very good as you can see
let's see if we can
I can go in favorites
the best way is not of course retina
I'm I'm sitting next to the HDTV
is that exactly the way to do
I'm looking forward to that
so right now it's outputting
I had a problem connecting the Samba file share so
so you can see that
it's 720p video that works alright
you're not gonna put too much of it because then
which is the most compressed 723 camcorder that I love
it and performativity can even go lower than that
then we can see over here
it's much better to use a mouse and a keyboard
hi everyone cynics of Syria with chewy iPad ltd tablet
CPU said quickly with three gigabyte
RAM with 3gb of ram 32
gigabyte storage on a 10 inch
10.1 inch display so performance is quite good
no problem with this connection while
I'm at the wireless spot
there is not much to see
there is a phone camera and the rear camera
it lasts eight hours in a PC
Mac I'm not sure you can see you cannot see
I will rest a little over eight hours
that's very good other feature that works well is
GPS okay okay and we get a fix almost immediately
let's go easy with candy crush saga first
the speakers are not the best
I want to do the job
you may want to connect external speakers is soft
okay so you get it
this one is no problem
I also try BB racing and Riptide gp2
okay let's go to video racing quickly have a look
okay so we get the idea
Riptide gp2 is not too bad
but let's go to the game where
I start to struggle a bit
let me rest a little bit
there is a keyboard as well
okay so okay this one we show that
sometimes we miss key prices but on the up keyboard
you won't have any such problems
I had to press twice okay
some light gaming is good so you may
you may consider this tablet
alright thanks for watching bye bye
I'm looking at the Toshiba
now this is a 10 inch or 10.1
Tegra Nvidia processor built in
which is a 1 gigahertz processor
it's got quite a bit of grunt
that looks like there's a dock connector site
that is what it looks like on the outside
I think it's a little bit too thick
besides that that the screen is actually quite good
so that's what these locking mechanisms do
I yeah each to their own
someone gonna love it some are gonna hate it
I guess maybe make that the CAO button
I mean with the whole thumb issue
I can easily cover the camera there
oh my mail my my talk
which is fantastic when I go into the apps
you'll here's some of the key differences
Docs to go and things like that
you know it's like two minute later
I think it's a great addition to the Android tablet
Picasa so really cool muscle interface for the media player
I noticed there was something else June
they were just added some great little features
I really think that you know
you know obviously navigation so
I just think that cameras in a really annoying spot
obviously when you turn it this way
changing the cub is making a bit more personal
I think that that really helps also
I just think it's a little big you know
I think that with what's out
there is hard for this tablet to be competitive
it's just a bit too bulky and this bezel thing
Docs but it's going to be right here
work on it on the on your couch
it is a good tablet
I'm not gonna say it's terrible
just not the sexiest thing
I'm doing it for charity
we'll speak to you soon
Let's get right into the unboxing.
losing or breaking all my pen nibs, in fact
Alright so the first thing we're gonna do after plugging
Now you should see this icon on your Desktop.
From here you can pretty much configure your tablet
and your frame will drop a bit
I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised
players are interested in anything other than the active area
and the pen's accuracy, but here you go.
You see these things there and there?
And finally, the load of spare pen
However this tablet is far from perfect.
As I already mentionned, its surface gets nasty
The price is also quite high
it doesn't feel super premium or anything
I will say that the one thing
that kind of sucks about this tablet
I guess not about this huh
the back of your hand starts sweating
I bought a Mac screen protector for that
that's just one area that I don't like about this
the rest of it is actually
I will say that my hands are fairly small
it's just an observation big hands
let me just go to something colorful
ah we go to Asterix and Obelix
then yeah the the color here is okay
it looks good um again
I'm in a room right now
watch this see that see
this one is a touch below that
that could be it but again touch sensitivity
I'm mostly okay with that
okay moving on to audio
they shop in three two one
I'll say it's barely passable in terms of the face
the rest of the audio is again
it's it's really whatever when
so what is it about this that
yeah not fast at all you got your mediatek helio
it's not good as you can see
now when you're starting up it's ok you swiping down
it's it's a little bit jumpy put it that way
Chrome that was that was decent
put it that way there was decent
let me launch something else
so let you guys see let's say
oh actually already had that open
YouTube by itself like they're the original YouTube app
and yeah you can see that was
that was whatever it wasn't that fast either candy crush
okay before we move on to you
know the rest of the tablet
the value of life on this thing is insane
this was completely out of left field
yeah so mix of manga and candy crush
that's probably the reason why
that's one of the reasons why
sorry about that okay moving on to a gaming so
I think I played for you guys
I'll use a different race track this time
I'm good because the mediatek helio p22 tee
I've never I've never really been a huge gamer
it's a very old crap
let's move on to a pub
Club G candy crush candy crush okay
finally talking about the camera on this thing
oh my goodness it's so so bad
I I couldn't believe it
our camera is so good and then
charging this tablet takes forever with the included charger
I don't think fast charge actually
do i recommends this tablet
that's hard to say because for myself i love it
I said it I used it for 10 hours
you don't need a great tablet
put it that way alright
that's it for this review
hi this is kayla from pakka blocks comm today
i'm going to review this graphics
some say that it's very good
some data is not that good so today
let's talk about the hardware
I can press them without looking at them
this is much more convenient
they are programmed for photoshop
this is actually a cable from my canon scam scanner
the light will stay on
this is tablet driver version
there is no usually for discount drivers
I'm using a 4k monitor
so this by the way will be at default
you will set it to your monitor
this is the mapping area
is this little charging pot here at the back
that is as light as a pencil
this is the tip and this is replaceable
let me show you the stand
that comes with the pen
I think there is a bottom at the stem
yes there is the bottom
power for this pen is very good
so you can see the cursor moving around here
hashing lines so this tablet is actually quite sensitive
it really depends on what kind of lines you want
I know we don't have that some of them
especially the pen display monitors
you know those wanting tests where you can draw on
the drivers are downloaded from prions website
so this is pretty standard
let's switch over to another software called MIDI Bank paint
this is a free drawing software
the lines still continue to come out so now on
my pen is on the surface now
this is unusable in me dying paint
that's um do some very quick strokes again
tablet looks fine with mischief
let's see what out of software do
it works very well on mischief the software
this is called sketches blue pro
I want em to be so
the beaut quality is actually quite good
I also like the buttons on the left side
however you can reassign them if you want to
the drawing surface has a nice matte texture to it
but we've found the software that I showed you earlier
some of them do not work
so if you really do want buy this tablet
I bought this around 70 to 80 US dollar
Wacom tablet at this size
it's usually 2 times as much so that's 160 dollars
there are balls so for us $80
yeah so that's over my review today
our program reviews sketching tips and tutorials bye you
yo like this video now
I used a different USB to fix the problem
Welcome driver from their website
I still decided to use the tablet driver created by
okay so let's get on to the gameplay come on
they're probably rich anyway because cute louder buddy
Jesus before light pulses it was me quiet
I don't care wow I'm at
it just came out rolling girl by various artists
I'm number five on the board
I'm really excited to start this
they have given me the in spy in spy
I was greeted by a cute little as saying
thank you for buying that tablet
honestly because it's bigger than the tablet
loads off next is the pen
this is only really cool
the driver was quick to install so
just enjoy the speed plate with me drawing with it
this turned out way better than expected
hey everybody welcome back to art by
and it's been a long time since
I've actually used a tablet
that isn't a display so
I currently use a Cintiq 22 HD
I'm really excited to try with this
some of the specs for this
so having an undo button is pretty nice
I have to download the driver
and then just finding your device
in our case it's the in spheroid
ok so after working with this for a little while
there is no power cable
it feels very flimsy to me
it's not it's not heavy
it doesn't have enough weight to it
so who would I recommend this to
that's looking to get new tablet
you can't really beat it
it's also going to you know
it's also going to be also friendly
the tabla is gonna be plug-and-play
I'll be using a box cutter to open the tape
I think my wife game is broken
we're going to be greeted with the pen
we're gonna talk about that
they're almost all equal in size
not really too much of a difference
there's also a s 640 pen for good measure
AP 20 rechargeable pen just kidding
going back to the p0
v pest pen for xc10 g6 40s tablet
I really wanted to talk about
the rubber is actually pretty grippy
but it really doesn't matter too much
comparison as you can kind of see
it becomes more apparent when you overlap
I don't know what happened there
oh yeah and apparently this is covered in plastic
you go for the g6
40s tablet driver which is third row down
down in this case can go ahead and click download
wait for it to finish
this is my piece of paper
this tablet does not have any rough surfaces
its finishes are very well
made the tablet surface looks nice and clean overall
this is something like that
hey this is a tablet that
that wasn't the case for this pen
which was a big plus
40s was the perfect balance between smoothness and latency
give this tablet a solid 5 stars
really nothing's holding this tablet back at all if anything
everything is preferential in the world of tablet
your tablet pen preference can be different
thank you very much for watching this video
I'll be glad to answer any of them
OC related contents in the near future
okay I'm gonna get going now
As always, all opinions in this video are my own.
See what I did there?
In 2019 Wacom released the Cintiq 16
This is great news for artists
The Wacom One is lean and mean.
but it will do the trick.
I wouldn't even bother trying.
The bezel design of the Wacom
Now let's discuss the pen.
The pen has over 4000 pressure levels
which is more than adequate for drawing and painting.
The pen resolution is 2540 lpi.
Pen tilt is supported which is great.
Even with the more budget minded tablets
Wacom is offering, you're still getting a top-of-the-line pen experience.
There are three spare nibs hiding behind legs.
Wacom pens like the Art Pen or the Pro Pen
2. But it does support other types of EMR pens.
I have this STAEDTLER, Noris digital pen
brands will be added in the future.
The line tests with the Staedtler Pencil are great too.
I notice that the Staedtler Pencil grips the surface more.
perhaps for note taking or sketching.
Having a button on the pen is definitely useful too.
It's very lightweight at only 2.2 pounds.
The stand is built in to the tablet.
There's a nice fabric pen holder in the top center.
You just slide your pen in and out of this.
device, you're going to need either
It's not like the Intuos Android that I reviewed
Now let's discuss installation and software.
Installation was very easy to set up.
And there's lots of other options you can tinker with.
There's Bamboo Paper which is a note taking app.
This is a great digital drawing and painting application.
This is very useful for doing video
Adobe Fresco is coming soon.
They're offering six months license
So what can you do with the Wacom One?
So who is the Wacom One for?
Android compatibility means the Wacom
One might even be a good tablet for photographers
It also feels great for note taking.
And I have to say, handwriting on the Wacom
One felt really natural while using the Staedtler Pencil.
And now for some comparisons.
And now for the price.
The Wacom One sells for $399.
So let's talk about some pros and cons.
The pros of the Wacom
One are that it's a very low-profile and lightweight device.
It comes with limited bundled software.
The Wacom One offers excellent pen quality
that's only exceeded by Wacom's Pro Pens.
The Wacom One supports other types of EMR
Pens which is great. And it supports some Android devices.
And now for the cons.
The Wacom One does not have any express keys
And now for my conclusion.
I'm also happy to see
One is not a tablet computer.
some of my other drawing tablet reviews.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
so just how good is it
it is a super simple device
obviously you have the large 8.5
inch screen up the front as well and LCD screen
I find that I generally try and use this
it's really easy to write on
because of the technology they're using in the display
there is like no lag
the screen is press that button
there are definitely a few drawbacks
which you know is a bit of a pain sometimes
those are two pretty big drawbacks
the fact that you can't erase anything or you know
I'll give you a quick example
how about service bribe to China Tech
Oh like it comes out really well actually it takes
it's really accurate you know
there's no blockiness it's not
I actually comes out really well
that's one of the reasons
I really enjoy riding on this display
the riding experience itself is pretty incredible
I really don't think you can go wrong
I find they super useful
thank you for watching if you enjoyed
XP pan decals 0/3 wireless tablet
this is a review unit
that was sent to me from
but before we look at the tablet in greater detail
we have the warranty card
we have a thank-you card and some brochure warranty policy
this cylindrical design is very simple
that's the remover and this here
the stylus included is not powered by battery
so you do not need to charge it
the design feels quite solid
it has a large rubber grip here
it's towards the lighter side
buttons have a nice quicky
feel to them and tip here
this pen supports slightly over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
and this is that tablet
the corners are rounded off
we have this red color
there are six physical shortcut buttons
the charging cable comes with two velcro straps
we have four rubber feet and here
this is the on/off power switch for the tablet
let me just put a wireless receiver in
he was shot cuts to the two side buttons
and if you are left-handed you can change that here
this is where you can test a pen pressure
I have already assigned mine
but let me just show you what you can do
the function key is actually this
scroll down here and you can choose different functions
OK and now when I press this shortcut button
let's test out the drawing functionality
this is Photoshop on the Mac
the pen is very sensitive
they are really quite smooth
let me show you how
well the line is tapered
I think they'd hipper quite nicely
you have to install welcome in towards driver
I'm using the scroll down to change the brush size
it's really easy to change the brush size
it does depend on the app that you use
the overall drawing experience is actually quite good
the lines come out just the way
these are the lines that I was talking about
it's quite impossible to draw smooth lines with
this is a finicky designer on the
it's able to detect pressure as well the last app
I want to show you is higher
we see some marks here
I had a very satisfactory experience
I like the pen case
I like the overall build quality and the design
and the look so this is
the link will be in the video description below
and that's all for my review today
I hope this is helpful
see you in the next video bye
with its Amazon fire HD 10 2019
there's no IDE option right now
a 10.1 is such an interest in competitor
that one is not supported
but that's very rare one game
I tried is a new
I tried that one's great as well
however that's not my experience at all
I think the performance was pretty good
yes not great for multitasking
but the gaming performance is excellent for its price
iPad is much faster but it costs twice
you can play most games
it has the same 10.1
inch screen and the black bezels
around it are quite big
it has a fully plastic body
I decided to get the blue one
so if you don't want that
I suggest you get a case for it
it's the first Amazon tablet with a USB C port
a tablet has two speakers
it's certainly fine for watching
YouTube Netflix and Amazon video
I used for the 2017 version
that's what many cheaper tablets are lacking
TM standards to support Netflix in HD
though so while the screen is not new
I think it continues to be fantastic in this price
you've got direct and fast access to all their services
hands-free that means you can call her
many of these ads are for books
well the Fire HD 10 is running Android
adjust does not always look like it
it might vote your volunteer though
the tablet cutter one time of 20 hours for this
only but my wizard is theoretical
that depends on what you're looking for
in fact it's the cheapest 10 inch tablet
it's not really worth it to upgrade
let's check out some alternatives
HD screen too and the build quality is similar
I'd personally go with the Samsung one
a cheaper alternative is the Amazon Fire HD 8
I can recommend comfortably right now
I'm Angie thanks for watching and see you next time
hey everyone in today's video
I'm going to review the VK 50 graphics tablet
this is a review unit
that was sent to me from gearbest.com
gearbest is a website that sells a lot of electronics
there are eight replacement tips included and a nib remover
that tells you where you can download the driver
quality for this tablet is actually quite good
I love the rounded corners here
I left a single sheet of material plastic
it's very comfortable to work with
there are eight physical shortcut buttons
but that's basically what you get with this track
Patty County go up down left right
we have this nice pattern
can you see the pattern
is dot matrix pattern here
nice rubber feet that prevents the tablet from sliding around
this is a very thin tablet
looks really good for our us
it's more towards the lightweight side
which is something that I like
there's a little wobble to the pen tip
I've just connected that tablet to my computer
I'm right-handed I'm going to do this now
there are several options that you can choose from
you can customize the clicks to different mouse clicks
you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts to those like buttons
there are other functions like accurate more
there are various monitors switch as well but
so here you can choose to map
let's take a look at the touch pad
so these are the options available
if you click on the drop-down menu again
these are the different functions
I have already customized directions to various shortcuts
more specifically for up and down
I have customized it to change the brush sizes
so yeah that's about it for the driver
all these features are will go on windows as well
these wages are testing out the different strokes
okay so these are the strokes
well see this giant cursor here
the lines they are very smooth
so when you are drawing curves like this usually
let's take a look at other apps
so here's another cartoon character that
I can get in a thick lines very easily
let's take a look at
Krita same thing pressure works
it's not only two apps that has pressure sensitivity working
welcome bamboo paper and sketch of all those are apps
I'm not sure why that happens
it's really worth the money as for
delete the wind tab drivers
see you guys in the next video bye
hello my name is Shannon Morris
I'm the producer of before you buy
I'm reviewing the Samsung ativ
tab 3 it cost 7 $29.99
inch tablet that runs full
so let's talk about the dimensions shall we
this is a 10.1 inch tablet
it's also 6.5 inches and it's very thin
it's less than an inch wide
oh it better be given
I must say so this is a Samsung tablet
very fun very useful and very nice
like a little click pad
that doesn't happen so well
so it's not an i3 like some of its competitors
there are also a front and a rear facing camera
so you're going to get pretty decent
Skype calls but other than that
the display is 10.1 inches
it also gets very bright
the ports on this are pretty nice
you get pretty much everything you could want
there's micro HDMI a micro USB
Windows 8 device out there probably the surface pro
that one runs around $900 on their website
so this is priced very well for that market
Windows 8 and it can be upgraded to 8.1
and it has an Intel Atom
try or don't buy this item
it's very nice it's very fun
I haven't reviewed for a long long
this is a very very affordable
now they did send me this out free of charge
I haven't asked to see the video
Android version 9 so nice and up-to-date
it's got an octa-core processor
this is what the screen looks like
it does have the Google suite of apps pre-installed
that would be strange watching that
let's just check that it's running a nice
oh that's an old one
let's get rid of that one
let's put a new newer video on here
we go this is one
the speakers are nice and clear
we've also got some photos
oh here we go of course so here we go
this was in less than optimal lighting
this was very very dark lighting
let's go across to this one again
let's pop into Google Chrome
I left a link to the van
so that's the closer look at the tablet before
Alex thanks for tuning in live
also sea winds mister vlogger
but this is what the tablet looks like again
it's a very robust tablet
it's got some metal construction in here as well
this is what the back looks like
I certainly can recommend it at this price point
I've been really pleased with how this is performed
I think is admirable for the price
I want to thank you all for watching
I really do appreciate it
I'll see you in another video very very soon
welcome back for another video so today
let's jump right in alright guys
we have the chewy vx3 7 inch android tablet
I will talk about the display
you'll find the three capacitive buttons at the bottom
that's the return the home button and the tabs button
and then if we take a look at the top
which you can per the back
we have the universal charging port
that's pretty much all you get
it says volume plus and volume minus and
every phone has the volume up and volume down rocker
they put the power button logo which
I've you know I found really pointless now
I also forgot to mention
and a lot of the time they are you know
but this feels really really nice
just feels really great for this tablet
this device features an mtk6592 processor
surprisingly they also be running on 2 gigabytes of RAM
they're offering me to review this tablet and at first
you wouldn't really expect it from you know
obviously the brand it's chewy or chewy
I don't even know how you pronounce it
Samsung but you know this tablet really does win
VX 3 7 inch android 4.4.2 tablet
i will totally advise you guys to go ahead
i would totally recommend this tablet
have a great day guys peace
I have no financial relationship with the company
they're not paying for this review
it's a very fast process here
when you get everything reattached
you do get a little bit of image bleeding
so that's what you got in there
kickstand so on the surface
you'll remember that that one kind of sits like that
this one sits more flat
that back kickstand here has a lot more surface area
it really does lay flat
the keyboard is also very nice
this is a ThinkPad keyboard
although for some reason it just stopped working
you're also reattach it and get it to go again
there is a backlight on here
I was expecting a louder
but it does sound okay
it's not too tinny and there is good stereo separation
DisplayPort over here for plugging in external displays
adapter here volume rocker up and down and a Kensington
your power switch is up here
they do have a little loop on the keyboard
USB port as a pen holder
if you want over here you can see when
closer to the screen that it's detecting its presence
what's nice too is it does have good risk detection
I don't see any drop frames
I'm really quite pleased with the quality of the display
everything is responding very quickly to what
that are not going to tax
a graphical processor too heavily
this is going to do quite nicely here
I've got a blu-ray MKV
this is a really nice little tablet device
I haven't been a big fan of this form factor
i've been thanks for watching
Android tablet with a quad core processor
it comes with a removable keyboard case
and here's the keyboard also comes with a stylus okay
we also have a wall adapter and a micro
it's been working great for me what
I wanted to look at right now
is the ports on the side
so let's take a look here so we've got microphone
it's one of the latest versions of the software
viewing angles on this device are pretty good
hopefully that gave you a good idea of
how videos would play on this tablet now
graphics were pretty smooth which is nice
how games work on this tablet
you can take it places
and now there is a kickstand at the back here
this keyboard here is magnetically attached to the bottom
I'm testing how to testing out
the document feature on this tablet keyboard works pretty well
I made a few errors
but it's also because of the angle
I'm at when I'm recording this this video
I do find the keyword pretty easy to use
I've typed up a few documents on here
no problem and it's nice that it connects through this
this cable right here so it's it's instantaneous
this is the jumper easy pad
six pro tablet that runs
Windows 10 and cost somewhere around two hundred dollars
so what do we get for that money
we get the Intel and 3450 CPU
this is a quad-core CPU
I mean it's awesome to watch a movie on this
um than a tablet one thing
I don't really like about
Bluetooth Aniki and um listen that way
that comes with this device
it's 1080p and at that resolution
they do work very very well
this is the same file -
the battery life is not bad for me personally
I had to charge it every second day
I love how big it is
definitely go for it alright
don't forget subscribe and I'll see in the next one
the viewing angles are good
I was quite surprised to see that
then you can actually install apps on that SD card
they don't sound that great
tablet is probably not ideal
the battery life on it
it's a bit challenging to you
so keep that in mind
inches screen but the tablet is very slow
the battery life isn't great
great at 720p so me personally
don't forget subscribe and I'll see in the next one
So let’s start with the truth for tablet buyers.
Tablet companies target well-known artists,
send them an inexpensive tablet to “review” or “unbox”
And if you don’t do what they say?
Well, they stop sending you stuff.
So be careful where you get your tablet reviews.
This includes their social media, sale prices, information about products
you didn’t even talk about in your review, etcetera.
I’ve tried to get companies to pay this.
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.
Sometimes you’ll be offered a chance to do a giveaway.
email lists and social media.
It’s also very easy to cheat in these contests.
Giveaways are worse than reviews.
The company is using you to profit.
Reviewing, sure, but little did I know that
Repeat this process until everything works.
Product testing is a paid job.
I got absolutely nothing out of doing this.
Never agree to test tablets.
You should be receiving the finished product ready for review.
The most recent development is review deadlines getting ridiculously tight.
So, what to do about all this?
Any of the stuff I’ve mentioned you can negotiate.
Say no, or even simply ignore unreasonable requests.
Give the product the rating it deserves.
You have the power here.
Please share this with other artists
you know so they don’t fall into the same traps
As of now I am quitting tablet
I wish to stay focused on animation and animation tutorials.
hello everybody Marco Chiappetta for hot Hardware here
she is right in front of you
that is a white 16 gig
the note is on display
here there's a simple literature pack
that's included with the unit
let me get some specifications out of the way first
the note 10-1 is powered by a samsung exynos
touch responsiveness is very good
Note 10 one a couple of the first things
are these front mounted speaker grilles here
this raised edge where the metal meets the glass
there's really nothing to talk about
they're perfectly smooth on the bottom
here is the s-pen slot
the s-pen is the stylus included with the Galaxy
when you slide that stylus out of its slot
some stylus optimized apps become available
lots of people prefer the stock
I actually kind of like it
these are the stock home screens
Android browser as you can see
Samsung is touting with the Galaxy
here's s note on this side
let me go back to s note
I try to scroll here
it is in an inactive state
I have four things open at once
previously tablets were really just about consumption
Samsung wants to change that
you just have more precision
let me bring up s note and show you what
Samsung's parts part of the reason
we hope you like this
quick look at the samsung galaxy
numbers come by the site
I want to thank you for stopping by
Windows 10 your Lynx vision
Windows 10 PC experience ensure maximum productivity between gaming sessions
the system comes complete with a gaming cradle
microUSB port so you can connect your Xbox controller
you can do that if you want to
the tablet itself has a very good weight to it
I've used several tablets in the past
it looks really good on
now the cradle fits neatly around the tablet
you can lock the tablet in place
two handles one on the left
it's very similar to the
Xbox elite rubberized grips now
just doesn't feel quite right
I put this down to muscle memory
you can do that sitting on the couch
this is a great solution
I do like the controller cradle
I did find that every so often
the battery lasts very well
so if you're looking for one good luck
I do recommend eBay for trying to search for one
hey what's up guys this is
this tablet is also available in five different colors
it has plenty of power
let's go and set it up
you can do your gallery
let me show you how to do that
find the application that you use the most
so let's say for example
do not disturb your built in memory
okay that's that max volume
taken on this tablet overall
this is a pretty good tablet
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
and golly gee they beat motorola on this the micro
SD card slot actually works
it's nice to looming them back
it looks like a fairly quality piece
we've got some plastic on the edges
pikas the antennas running under the edges stereo speaker
so it's a nice looking tablet
it's definitely one step up more than one
step up from some of the super budget ones
we'll compare them in a minute
terms of sharpness and color saturation is good
this is at maximum brightness
right now if you're in a bright room
Tegra 2 CPU standard stuff right there
Wi-Fi 807 BG and a single band
it costs a lot of money
it's about 1 pound 12 ounces
but it feels like actually feels lighter than Motorola Xoom
you get a lot less
so you've got that dual core
Linpack as well and here we've got pretty much
I think Google doesn't really want it
I app which is a streaming multimedia hub
let's see what talking about right here
we'll take a look at that right now
we're in the bookstore view
oh well you download something from feed books in fact
you're not going to want to read like this
probably you'd prefer to read in portrait mode
that's a much better presentation
you can put bookmarks on here
that's on the internal storage area
I should mention that with Android
I've got Google books over here
you can have your dual facing pages over here
you can change your font size
you can do that in fact
take a look at multimedia
they've got their own photo browser on here we've got
it's a streaming media player for streaming it
you control is slightly complicated
I supposed to put two fingers on the screen
it looks like you poked
of course you can just use it normally
let's check out an email player
let's check out videos and it shows you movies
so let's just take a look at the honeycomb
they were all try playing something off of YouTube
the performance is very good on the dual core
it's a very desktop like experience
they're gonna take a look at gaming
it's not the highest quality cutscene everything
but how much does that matter
you have your little little indicators
HDMI USB C microphone headphone
picks up fingerprints pretty easily
let's look at the bezels
you can see that the top and bottom bezels
there's really not much to complain about the book quality
m89 definitely has a decent screen
it's not the best again
you might actually be concerned or you might
I use LCDs most of my life
most of them are better
it's actually very good for reading comics as well
4 by 3 is what you want to get
which would be this tablet right here
the screen has noticeably yellowed
and this actually does help
it's annoying but it's not deal breaking
oh and before that the audio volume is super loud
so there's really nothing to worry about there all right
so there's that as you can see
very impressed with the standby battery life
as you can see here
I don't really care that much
there's really no problem with it
this is very well optimized
it's pretty much as whoops
there are times that multitasking
I'm not sure what's going on
I think there just might not be enough
so there's that's not good
the performance is not bad
this is a pretty light game though
asphalt has crashed which is annoying
I don't think ashwaldt has ever crashed really that much
I don't know why it crashes
I am impressed with it
I think sometimes it goes actually higher
maybe 190 at certain stories at that price
I really wouldn't recommend it
hey guys what's going on
my name is Christian and welcome to another video
that's the name and it doesn't sound very interesting
I must say the template for sale on tequila
Noga it has 3G calling tablet capabilities
it has 16 gigs of memory
it's process er it comes with two gigs of ddr3
it has a whopping six thousand milliamp hour battery
it has dual sim capabilities
it has GPS Bluetooth version 4 and Wi-Fi 802 PGN
that's more than half a kilo
I shouldn't have to note
what more could you need with a battery this size
this would be quite good
I'll see you same time
hello shoppers for today's video
it comes with a standard box packaging opening it up
jack and a sim tray
the right side doesn't offer anything
it is just a smooth and blank
it doesn't include that much bloatware or pre-installed
apps to test the tablet
i also installed some apps that i usually use
in here i will be testing
the video and sound quality by playing
your goal to destroy it
it doesn't produce smooth lines
the tablet has no problem drawing straight lines
it does however go uneven when drawing curved lines
this gives you a way to customize your phone system
it's just like an easter egg
some of these aren't yet done
then let's go here in
i just carelessly put it down
it is exactly 20 nibs as i counted
it won't focus lmao in pink color TADAAAA!
anddd there's a black box
let's open it soooo here
it is lmao maybe even if i throw it away
the tablet won't be damaged
the bag is thick with many pockets
this is supposed to be unboxing but i got excited
i bought it on sale in
what's going on my name is
Kevin the tech ninja and today
we are reviewing another Lenovo product
this is the yoga 2 tablet now
this is a different version of it this is
Lenovo yoga tablet 2 8 inch
let's find out just like it's tennis brother
the yoga 2 8 inch is a sleek tablet
mostly silver in color with a variety of design materials
it would be hard to find a person to say
the front-facing camera is on the side
bezel at the bottom or side depending on your orientation
I use my thumb to slide the stand out
modes these modes are called stand
hold tilt and hang on the right
the top is completely bare and the opposite side
bezel is the headphone jack right now
just like the 10-inch yoga
LCD display is full 1080p resolution
the blacks are also rich in color
IPS LCD s in general
the chassis is built from plastic now
the yoga 2 8 inch makes me scratch my head
but it's still pretty good
this device absolutely flies when gaming
the yoga comes out of the box with
it's also running lenovo's own
UI skin on top of Android
Android or there's a better alternative in the Play Store
one application that sticks out for the bunch is security
the camera is a yoga tablet
you need to adjust your hand
your hand naturally rests over the camera
if you rapidly tap the shutter button
a tablet is their number one device
you really can't go wrong
make sure you like this video
we're gonna have a look at the exit icon
this screen is 1280 by 800
it's hard to show really on the camera bodies
I'm looking at it in here
suppose this is what you probably expect
it's got 16 gig of storage
so let's see how well that works
I'll just turn it off
this usually shows up fingerprints quite well and actually
I have to say that works pretty
you know these asa stuff which
I'm not that keen on
we've talked about these before these a be app
what about watching video on it
what a and let's just try a YouTube video
let's just run the volume up
it's not sad it's pretty is decent loud
it's not too bad doesn't volume reasonable
I really like that screen
considered is 1280 by 800
it's it looks really good on that
you can go for gadget
and then you've got the option notepad a calculator whoops
let's just go see it there
I guess you it's not bad idea
it seems okay another nice feature that
I use a lot on my Lumia phone
it's not on other devices
I use so I've just tried a
it's a game 3d game so as you can see
it seems fairly smooth like 3d games
the process is probably pretty good for the game
and he's playing fairly well whoops
we'll have to wait and see
got some more testing to do on that
it feels quite nicely made
who is an 8 inch version as well
we're getting a desktop class
don't forget to subscribe to this channel
the tablet feared surprisingly high-end
that's because we get a mostly metal body
the upper part is made of a blue plastic
it weighs as much as a competition
it's a bit disappointing that we get just one
USB C port there's no headphone jack and no micro
PC hubs and also connect external monitors and other accessories
the back of the tablet is protected
but the frame is unprotected
it's not very premium feeling of course but that's okay
I like that you can open the kickstand quite wide
and that one has a metal hinge
the keyboard is connected using a magnetic connector
so you don't have to charge it separately
I was able to type with it very fast
sure it might be because
I'm used to working with tablets
do offer a real treble which is great
I reviewed the Acer Chromebook tap 10 but no other
it will be much longer today than any
YouTube does not perform perfectly inside the browser
we get the kind of home screen like on
better thought through when using the do-it
Chromebook as a tablet I sometimes notice smaller issues
I've installed YouTube Adobe Lightroom Netflix onedrive
Chrome OS is based on Linux
and in fact you can install normal
it's quite bright with 400
nits and it's readable outside
viewing angles are very y2 sure on
offer a better sound you can use the duet
it supports 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity
you can start a new node very quickly sustainer notes
stylus you can write handwritten notes on your droid
I think the pen is good enough
you're better off with the competition
the tablet gets pretty good results
the real-life performance is good too as I said so
I did manage to end the video
both games look better even on the cheapest iPad
they do perform as they do on a similar end
other games like asphalt 9 and other similar games too
I wouldn't recommend it as a game tablet in particular
it surprised me in a positive way
I think severe you as fantastic
I'm not outstanding but certainly fine
let's check out the alternatives
s5e we can exit have s6
another direct competitor is the Microsoft Surface
every tablet it gets released a man's rifle mine
thanks for watching and see you next time
hi guys come in here so today
I'm going to review the Bank u matrix pad s8
this is an 8-inch Android tablet very inexpensive
but let's see if it's worth your money
so let's do an unboxing
let's peel off the plastic
open the box and see what's inside
so first is the tablet itself
we'll look at that in just a moment here
love to see that in the tablet here
and here's the specs so 8 inch
IPS display 1280 by 800 64-bit 1.3 gigahertz quad-core CPU
FM radio microSD expandable to 128 gigs and Google
which makes it feel a bit inexpensive
saturation which is surprising for an IPS
that's very nice in the head
Amazon will be a link in the description as well
we'll see in the next video take care
they've got like this cute little fox character
he's a chill little guy
i really like how it looks
what else in the box
you've got like your plugs here on the left
it's got a little usb
we'll have a look at it a bit later
here is the pen it comes in this really nice
this is the pen itself
it's not a chargeable pen
there's the quick guide that has the installation instructions
it's not as long as it looks
it's just all loads of different languages in there
yeah it's a three-in-one cable
so that's all handy randy dandy
i'm gonna go over that a bit later to show
we're back to this bad boy
so there's the black hdmi and the black usb
those would be both going into your pc
when you open that it'll ask you to install
the response is really nice
the pressure is really nice
it wouldn't quite pick it up
you can see here that it works totally fine
it was just on occasion
they're like oh do i do
i was surprised that you didn't have to
i'm probably gonna keep plugging it into the wall anyway
but having that as an option is really cool
i'll go over the pros and cons
um it's very modern and attractive looking
i love the silver and black
it's very it's very sleek
the pen doesn't need charging at all
and yeah the slim design makes it extra portable
i was drawing so i was like
the the cables are kind of finicky
um i have to do some freelance animation next
i hope this has been informative for you
i think this is a pretty decent tablet again
i've only used it for a few weeks
but it's been pretty damn good
um i'm gonna keep using it for a little bit
i'll update you guys later so uh thanks for watching
i'll see you again sometime
these are my tyd tablets now
the box is the tablet itself
which is what we'll go through
so that's what's in the box
just move the other one in addition to that
you also get a plug charger
so it's an octa-core processor
it's not a glass screen
I'll just be using these Wireless
so that's the only reason why
I'm not going to be using that now
the back is that's metal
we'll come back to this shortly
it's one of the first things you've got to do
get some videos to show you how to do
here's a picture that I took earlier
we've just gone to that not the best
you can put whatever you want on there
it's a little bit tinny
that's coming through those speakers
just turn against us pause it so
but reduce it in size
so there's your YouTube app again
take it back screens nice and responsive
I haven't put the screen protector on
it's a certainly a recommendation anywhere
nice and quick to charge
easy to set up can't go wrong
I've got here the Lenovo Tab 8 10
it was around 100 bucks so
I'm really curious to see what it has to offer
it feels really light and thin
it's not gonna be a problem just by holding it
it's a pretty cheap quality
I already set it up
it takes a while to launch apps
its it has a pretty slow response
the frame rates look decent the overall picture
so that's a good sign
so that's a positive thing
depends on the way you're holding the tablet
I don't really like the bezos
it has like a pretty pretty big bezels
let's talk about the cameras
well it's looking pretty good
it's a five megapixel camera on the back
so moving on to the thumb facing camera
it's a two megapixel camera
let's talk about the recording quality
I'm just going to record a video
I'm kind of blown away by the mic quality
its has a pin and light design
also as a pre for $100 tablet
this would be a pretty good option for you
thank you so much for watching
what is going on guys griggles
TV this is the symbols tango
let's just talk about that real quick
so and that should work perfectly great
pretty much resolution 720p plus so
I've seen but it does get fairly bright
I'll show you in a minute
and 5 gigahertz networks also
you're going to get a microphone
which basically is really a microphone
headphone jack you get a micro
USB mini HDMI full USB port
that's a full-size USB port
you also get right here
that does have a keyboard that goes for 139
if you want to get there
this is also a lot of time
let's turn the volume up
you can see the screen right here
see how high we can push it
it's playing it absolutely fine
just make sure it's switched over
it's not a 1080p screen
I could jump ahead really quickly
so the the Wi-Fi is quick with it videos
let me just bring up another video of mine
I can play this one
you can see the angles are really good awesome
the videos a little bit choppy when
you can make the window bigger or smaller
let's check out some games
I'll play tag with Orion and subway surfer
you'll definitely be able to do that
let me jump into another game cuz
I'm not very good at these games
so let up subway surfer all right here
oh he's catching up to me
see if I can get running
I'm not good at any game
I ever did on this game
are you supposed to do that
yeah you can see it
let's just load up a website
click on one of these stories
how about nothing too depressing
Musk from the guy from Tesla
click on his story so usually it works
I didn't see a ton of customization
I probably wouldn't know fully recommend it
it's a cool little tab
that one's 129 as well
we'll see you guys down the road
I'm super late for dinner
so this is a Xiaomi media writing tablet
that is a problem but anyway
so yeah there's absolutely no way
I'll talk later about that
and very nice flicker rejection on
I phone eight all right so yeah
read this just has the one button which
there is a ton of dust here
packaging is pretty nice so they have
Xiaomi does very beautiful stuff though
I think it's exactly I checked it earlier
so it's pretty much an a4
I mean I yeah why not
it's it leads the nice design so yeah
I'm not angry about it
oh yeah this is filthy
i think it's supposed to latch
this is basically the best part for it
that's it's it's not like it's easier to take off
this is so i was saying that
it is with the pen
it's gonna draw a super thick line
yeah so that is adequate
I'd say I don't have any complaints
I don't know does it get smudges when you bend
it is the question and no
I can immediately see or none that have developed yet
I mean Xiaomi does beautiful like nicely done stuff
you have to cut it you have to cross it
otherwise you have to erase the whole and my
I don't know so it ends up being like that
let me actually bring in a four
I don't know decent and what else
yeah so contrast is definitely not a strong suit
yeah this this color with blue eh
the people just have different lights
I had no idea the lock
I don't know I do enjoy you Kiki given that
I don't mind the writing experience at all
used is what I paid for this
write the traditional ink right
it's a lot of money right
language is completely to my liking
I love it this is how I do it
let's make it big and you have colors
you have black so you can go like this
so this is a basically a vivid
I'm I'm fine with it
you can copy stuff duplicate stuff
so there's different styles of pens right
you can't but again this is pretty powerful right so
moving around is also pain in the ocean
this isn't always the case right so
Phone no there's no Windows Phone app
I took some took some sketches for a YouTube video
I want to move right this little thing right
I don't want to move it to page three
yeah out of luck you can't and so
right eraser has also this like selection mode
what else can I say about it
I mean for a prototype
charging port has a little metal reinforcement so again
that's very cute given that this is made of plastic
I'm I'm impressed by how well it's tucked together
so the front display sheet
let's call it is is perfectly adhered
but they're clicking so they're decently clicking
Wi-Fi I had some some talks with the support team
this little leather pouch is super nice
it fits the pen very snugly
well so you if you find on
everything about it is super nice
Xiaomi tablet is also pretty interesting
I think 90 times up until now
yeah that's about it any other questions
leave them down in the comments
so yeah alright come on
Android tablets are hard to find and great Android tablets
up in a super thin chassis
it's bright vivid has great viewing angles and color saturation
tablet isn't a problem at all
I haven't ran into such an issue
Sony's audio enhancements through these speakers
the z4 tablet doesn't necessarily change that
but some of them can be a lot of fun
should you decide to use them picture
it takes decent photos and good lighting
I changes a few things from stock
Android like the color scheme and customizable
this is definitely a huge selling point for ps4 owners
these prices put it squarely an Apple iPad territory
that couldn't be more true
thank you so much for watching this video
this is the Huyen canvas 13
here's how you could avoid that
thirteen is a pen display
if you're new here you need a computer
this has to be plugged into a computer
it's just a fancy-pants monitor
Android phones or tablets and used that way as well
inch display to be exact
we've seen big gains in the line quality
we've seen big gains in the quality of the screens
they're putting into these things and if
I was to guess where we would go next
and that's what this pen
I think it nails that landing
Blais to launch blazes ultimate game idea contest
submit your game idea by April 13th

can't program doesn't matter can't draw still doesn't matter
all you need is creativity
your game can be 8-bit 3d futuristic retro VR AR
it comes in three colors
there's violet purple midnight green and Cosmo black
I wish I went with the purple
this isn't new but it's worth mentioning here
this is a laminated screen
the screen itself has an anti-glare coating on it
it doesn't really reflect that much
it also provides a little bit of drawing resistance
it appears that all that is gone
it is a nice step forward
I couldn't replicate the Photoshop problem
all of them seemed to work pretty well
there are some extras in this package
there are two drawing gloves
no no you cannot make me
the box is a three-in-one cable
that's pretty standard with pen displays
I have a little bit of a situation here
I have cables like that
it's sunk in a little bit
it requires a special cable
that's the cable that came with my Mac for charging
it looks narrow enough to me catches
those tend to be more pricey
I couldn't test this I was
I couldn't test those either
I couldn't find it on their website
and so instead I I googled

now you can control your computer with your pen display
it's just really hard to unwire years
feels great to draw in but it doesn't go fullscreen
have their own drawing app now
it doesn't have pen pressure or go
fullscreen the winner from all of the art apps
I tried was definitely infinite painter
this is partly because of the things
I mentioned above like the apps not supporting it fully
so you're constantly repositioning yourself now
Wacom one this is a cool idea
it's just not there yet and for the canvas itself
I think that USBC cable is gonna be an issue
I have no problem with saying
hey this is a great pen display
go for it have fun
I really like a lot of things about it
that are very similar to this
so how good can such a cheap tablet be
I mange for my next ever calm
Scylla no vote at m7 is fantastic
who would have thought that
that's because renova is shipping
DTaP m7 with a metal body
SD card slot and a headphone jack
speaking of the headphone jack
the sound quality is bad
and there's no real dice at all
many phones are much better speakers
I don't think that's too much of a downside
it was fine for everybody
it's not a top performer
MTN were 21 quad-core processor
well these are the options in some countries
which is the only one available
enjoy a meeting right now
it's goes to worse than the cheaper
Amazon fire 7 benchmarks like and to to the test
I've been doing with it
the performance is good enough for that reading
just don't have too high expectations while you can watch
during my time with this tablet
there is no split screen view for example
we do get server versions
UI at all which is great
vanilla and word 9 goal
like a calculator the camera app
and it'll be audio app
but that's it since this is a super cheap device
I don't expect it to ever get Android 10 go
they know was pretty bad with updates in general still
it's a good decision from Lenovo to use
because operating system itself suman's quite smoothly by the way
Android ninth I in my bed
for my bed we test
alright let's get to the end of my
I can recommend it in a couple of circumstances
range the tab m7 has quite a lot of potential
it's very quality is fantastic and the screen and bed.you
more you can get much better performing tablets
let's check out some alternatives
a direct competitor is the Amazon fire 7
every tablet that is released almost worldwide
and we'll see you next time
Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet
all the opinions you're about to hear are my own
Amazon calls them special offers
it is pretty much the same from a hardware standpoint
but you'll notice the screen is very shiny
I could say to the tablet here while it's off
it will do any of the echo commands
I thought was kind of nice
not much for ports on this one
this will take up to a 400 gigabyte card
last year's version topped out at around 200 gigabytes
you got a camera here on the back
so you could use wireless devices with it one thing
I've heard from people over the years is that sometimes
this connector causes some trouble over time
you got a built-in microphone over there
they say is up to 10 hours
I think that's probably realistic
even videos are popping up here without too many problems
I can hit play on that
it's not bad from a general browsing standpoint now
you'll notice some of those web pages really
don't load up all that quickly
and maybe act a little sluggish on this particular tablet
and what they've put together
that just loads right up very very quickly here
and they make that a very smooth process here
Android platforms this is the Android version of Minecraft
you can certainly get by with this
and now we have this persistent echo show interface
they sell a dock for about 40 dollars
Amazon devices with a screen so by and large
I think it's an OK tablet
I do recommend though from a performance standpoint
I think this is definitely something worth considering at
Allegretto the four guys with quarters podcast
Tom Albrecht Gerard Newberg in Cali an Kumar
hey what's going on guys this
ETA brought back here again today
it actually took a while to ship out
they also offer a 128 gigabyte model at 299
that's what I have here
jack unfortunately there is no headphone
jack built into the tablet
so you will have to use this adapter over
the keyboard is really nice
I'm used to typing on a full-size keyboard
I'm really into the tablet aspect of this
I want to carry this around
the build quality is amazing
this has that dual tone
it's ice blue and iron gray
I think it looks amazing
I think these sound amazing
we have 4 gigs of lpddr4
X Ram like I said you can get these
unfortunately it does not offer a microSD card option
so you're gonna be stuck with what you have
the screen on the duet is actually really nice
so this thing does get pretty bright
everything looks correct on the screen
Chrome OS and we do have access to Android apps
which is a big plus for a tablet like this
they actually work really well
and it's not going anywhere
there's actually two modes here
I mean it feels just like any other
I do want to mention this
I would go with something like the Galaxy
it actually works really well here
it's not going to work here
there has to be an arm hf version like here
this does work on arm
I do a review on a tablet
you'll have no trouble using it
I ran with Geekbench 5
we have the duet over on the right
we have a similarly priced tablet
the new tab s6 slide
we scored a 263 multi-core 932
I used for this was 3dmark
we're only able to test
OpenGL on the duet because it's not supporting Vulcan
and that'll definitely help out and games that support
and unfortunately this is the phone version of Netflix
it's not the big HD version still
great here earlier in the video
we went down to around 1
I've tested in the past
my first impressions of the duet are pretty good
it's got awesome sound and we also have
Chrome OS installed and you're looking for a cheap solution
this is an awesome slim
I think it's a pretty decent deal here
I'm a hardcore chrome OS user
but that's pretty much it for this one
this is the innovators 16
why is it more expensive
and which one you should get
XP pen tablet that they released last year
well we have all the other goodies
Hydra cable that you would find on the other tablet
I didn't notice any difference between the two
also fun fact they are interchangeable
I well that I've noticed
it looks it looks better to me at least then
you also get the same film covering the screen
Nikolaas screen so once again
I wish for this version
they use a stronger glass instead
that's going to be identical
I couldn't notice any difference now just to check
so which is my naked eye
so there's a slight slight delay in activation
so this is something I'm really
at least that's what it feels like when using it
it wasn't any more than 1080p but then against once
I tested all the usual
I'm getting used to it
it's doing something right but basically
not enjoyable very affordable though and this one here think
of course this is more of a personal thing yeah
I've never really enjoyed the experience
that's a great place to be
it's a great build quality great technology and affordable
we have amazing but expensive tablets
we're still looking for this one
now where do you think
the main difference between the two here is that
it's a little bit slimmer
it really depends what $50 is worth to you
I would probably take the innovator 16 over the artist
it's really not gonna change much
so in my opinion yes it is totally worth it
that's a little bit more premium kind of overall
I hope the review was helpful all right
welcome to the video from the lifestyle
I come in this video
we're going to look at this
it's a port convertible tablet
let me start at the beginning of this
so it's a convertible slice
look at it as a tablet first
doing what really not a convertible of course
Windows 10 supports the tablet mode
we've got Kensington lock we've got volume headphone
it's not getting too hot
we'll talk about performance in a bit
that's quite nice on the dot on the a
a data only SIM card
it's really very nice tablet
it doesn't move right it doesn't push back
you can push right the way back on this
it actually balances quite well
there's some travel on the keyboard
I think you could type reasonably quick on this
Mouse and the pointer it as well right spec wise
it's a core m7 processor with plenty
editing videos on here power do
it's a good example to talk
it works really well on there
you know you can open big
the 8 gig of memory should be plenty of performance
so you can put the pen in like that
it was the best way we choose it with
let me just get the keyboard
put it into tablet mode all of that
I did have some of the pen
that's just create a new page one thing
I'm a good drawer with the pen
but you could do if you wanted to
that's the only thing that's missing
you've got the pen you can
this one's at 2160 by 1440 very nice
so let's do one thing
I really like about the screen
very sharp very clear with a good color
reproduction as you can see from there
so that's a definite post on this device
it turns it back your life
I forget about five hours
various prices depending on the configurations
it's got the pen input
of course you've got the keyboard fly
well my short time with this device
I'd say it's a very nice
the surface book is more of a laptop
I guess but I very much like this
but that's more of that again
I think works really well
Windows tablet apps full desktop on there
you wouldn't need another device if you're using this
that goes with it on the ditch
are you in the market for a quality tablet
Kyo matrix pad s 2010 inch Android tablet
it has a built in
it includes everything you need
and let's take a look on the right side
where do we want to go out of
our own website is a good place to start
hey there we are ooh
let's open one of the photos here
turn it sideways for a better experience
baseball season is getting started
Coupee do is up to
let's take a closer look at the flower
my favorite thing to do is watch videos
youtube came pre-installed in the Google folder
let's see our channel again
one of my favorite games is solitaire
set up for me there we go
it's an ace in ten and that
Jack does not go over there
I love photography in the 8 megapixel
rear camera takes beautiful pictures
this tablet has that others don't typically have is built-in
GPS give me directions to the nearest pharmacy Rite Aid
GPS on this tablet is a really nice feature
it should be just up here
I could do this all day
it even has built-in FM radio
swipe up to see all the apps click on
pair a new device and select your device
okay maybe some crossword puzzles the van kieu
Matrix pad s20 has everything I need
it's Jared D tech venture
we felt this product was worth our time
so is it worth yours
let's find out together the hue
I intend 60-plus is a direct competitor to walk
however the real selling point here for
the tablet comes nicely packaged and comes with everything
you expect it to plus more okay
I miss anything while we did
the side buttons can be physically pressed
don't get me wrong though
we never had any issues getting the job done
I would have to say that
it's not a microUSB cable
which would have made more sense
but it's a proprietary charging cable
we decided to jump straight to
I kind of wished that it came with stickers
it was very accurate tracking our movements
we did notice a bit of a delay
whenever we sped our pen movements
we were hoping to answer
Canadian on the Amazon store
well that's it for today guys
don't forget to hit that
we post affiliate links for products
it's been a pleasure guys
i'm jared the tech venture
this is a super mobile tech review
this is their mm pretty much only
display the usual 1280 by 800 resolution
it's priced at 549 dollars
which is certainly steep for a consumer tablet now
corporate pricing does tend to be higher but still
but that's that's how they're marketing it
we're not looking for cutting edge consumer resolutions here again
it's a little door right here
we have an empty slot
that would be for a SIM card
we have the power button the headphone jack
I'm sure to eventually get jellybean
but it doesn't have a now
there's no extra widgets here
this is just straight pure
it's just the standard stuff that you get with
Android so for those of you
who really just want straight pure Android
Andrew do I hear nothing special
going on tablet feels quick enough
it shred it's a very light clean implementation
that's ballpark for a Tegra
3 tablet and on - -
you're definitely good to go
the air also pleasant to use
because it's so darn thin
that switchover becomes official when we go to jelly bean
you can see the standard
speakers are actually pretty good
you're not even a half volume pop
it's not the loudest tablet on the market
but it's not harsh it's not tinny
quality on the rear camera
usually you don't get to actually see the water there
Oh Aaron is all over our faces
given how thin and light
there's nothing there about the very basic google essential apps
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
this is the fidgets ooh stylistic
M 532 don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel
Dave al Tavella for hot hardware
comm here with the first
HDMI port right behind this little
a fairly sparse offering to be honest here
this is a standard chiclet style
netbook sized keyboard really cramped
and you'll notice that the tablet actually boots fairly quickly
it's a little bit faster than the average
windows user interfaces evolved and there's no question the
Metro user interface is very different
let's go ahead and go through those now
this is the Windows Metro
down here will always get you back to that
that will always get you back to the
Wi-Fi and battery level indicator over here
you've got a Settings button you get devices
swipe in from the right now
let's go ahead and show you that
it now moves into a secondary portion of the screen
okay now we can bring this back
the toolbar brings up the keyboard
these days you've got pension zoom available
and what's more impressive as you can see right there
the tablet re-renders the image very quickly
this tablet the reason why
but they're not using a lot of resources
they're in the background and asleep
that will come with a Windows
lots of different things available here
we've gone ahead and installed a game app
that will go ahead and pull up
let's go ahead and show you
look at the asus vivo
Tab RT Windows RT tablet
I have something a little different for you guys
hs6 one one for those
who don't know graphic tablets or pen
i would say it's about 8 by 12 inches
I do use a lot
it could just be that
1:1 comes in three colors
everyone stays safe and I hope you're doing well
here and welcome back to another video in this one
this is a standard drawing tablet meaning
this is currently 50 dollars
they've got a nice nice
click enos to them which is really nice
so obviously you get the tablet
the next thing you get from bike normally
it comes with this weird material
I don't know if it's like suede or something
I don't know what this material is
but it's nice little carrying bags very light
you get the pen itself which is completely battery free
it doesn't require any charging or anything like that
it's that same kind of glove materially
it's nice kind of a soft fiber
Eskom aterial it's very elastic
it's fine the other things you get
I don't know why it comes in a little baggie
all you gotta do is go to the website
download the zip file of the latest drivers
then all you got to do is just quickly
you're using so this is great brief
Adobe Premiere or movie studio or DaVinci Resolve
it's a different set for each one of those
so that's really handy here a lot of times those
I've already used this tablet
don't get along rail because it's been so long since
I've used them I pretty much
100% switched over to display tablets
I was able to sketch really easy
the surface is super smooth
it's a 10 by 6 area
the surface is super smooth
the pen is you know battery free
thank you guys so much for watching this video
leave comments below if you have this tablet
they've been very helpful for me with any questions
I've had make sure you leave a comment on anything
let's take a look at the things that I included
sure you need warranty service
it has a nice weight to it
which makes it feel very solid
this is very nice to hold very well
I like to look and design aesthetics
it's matte which is really nice to draw on it
has that almost paper like you
it's very thin on the back
it's very nice the patterns
the control wheel provides very nice feedback
alright let me show you what the driver can do
this is the driver on
you can choose this option here to switch a screen
there is this option to enable
I'm not sure what keen mode is
this is the work area by default
let's take a look at the pressure transition
it's very precise very accurate
it's also very smooth this is Krita pressure sensitivity
I'm drawing the trackpad on my laptop
there is also input pad and now
pay attention to the shape of the cursor right now
vertical tilt and pressure can work at the same time
and this is affinity photo pressure whoops here as well
that's a very typical for the shop
let's see if device can taper nice
and when the curves are turning it's also very smooth
let's draw a very faint pressure
Photoshop is two input lag
but that really is a problem with photoshop
I have tried this tablet this
we don't have that where this phone where my other
it only works with this phone
it's it to support cute
I mean the this app that I'm using welcomed
bamboo paper is said to support tilt but somehow
they all don't work because there is no driver
you can customize the shortcuts you can definitely draw on
it crashed and it lost connections
alright to conclude the design looks really nice
that's really due to the optimization of cretan
you would have to check out a tax review
is their phone tablet or something else
sometimes the mapping is not done
it didn't work well with my android phone
I recommend using this tablet with desktop
Trung software rather than with Android so overall
see you in the next video bye
could it be a useful tablet with that
I mange for my next table calm and in this
Lenovo tap is seven review
you will find out whether that is true or not
this review is about the newest
we get a power button and the volume controls
I've got some other things to say about the cameras
we really can't expect good cameras
some we theater applied onto the screen
it really should be a bit better
better score and cost us $30 more
well those are benchmarks at this price
I think we can thank Android
that wasn't the case with the lenovo
Chrome with a lot of open tabs
I think that dude is a small RAM
it's probably another issue with this small
either you won't be able to play pop
I think it is usable
the lenovo tabby seven ships with Android 8.1
usually it is transparent with the wallpaper shining through
Netflix in HD synthesis not NHD Ted
it does not lose much energy while in standby
alright that's the end of my
that is not that easy because it is very cheap
I think that is important
the battery life is very short
Lenovo should have used an IPS screen
let's take a look at a couple of alternatives
there are minor differences on
that is running a heavy
UI and no Google apps are pre-installed with Lenovo
we almost get vanilla Android
is the software again we often saw
you might not get any local volunteers
Lenovo tap East 7 review
every tablet that is released almost worldwide
thanks a lot for watching
hey guys love and peace toons here and today
I will be reviewing the V
the accessories are all great
also there are four options on the
Left pane mapping function and about us
I'm playing around with the sensitivity here
I'm pressing down harder and softer on the tablet
of course you can see it all working just fine
this is very handy as
there was no need to restart or anything
and it was mapping all right so
I'm seeing something like that
being offered anywhere and speaking of design
I think it is aesthetically pleasing
buttons feel like well buttons
they all seem to be working
just fine at the time of recording this
the buttons have not been customized
so you can see that
their default functions are also working fine
I decided to test out the pen
the buttons do their job well
the mezzanine gets 5 out of 5
so there was a slight hiccup with the setup
the material does not feel like very cheap plastic
oh man you're only paying 40 pounds for this
I think it's a great beginner tablet
I think it turn out alright
this is a major upgrade
and it's a nice little upgrade that
I got it for 110 now
they put quite a lot of effort on the package
the tablet is composed of a thin sheet of aluminum
the tablet weighs 308 point 44 grams
Cortana what's up it's - maple Saturday
the specification is pre beast
that gets it up to one point
gigs of free internal memory
gigabytes and the tablet reads it just fine
the side vessels are small
Wi-Fi still works with airplane mode enabled
the tablet has bluetooth 4.0
the sound on this is not that great when
I pump the sound all the way up
there's a bit of cracking
a pair speakers really helps a lot
also due to its thinness
Windows version of Minecraft with subtle lag
the tablet has an accelerometer gyroscope and GPS
I'm kind of sucking a bit right now
modern combat 5 runs officially on it
I have Word Excel publisher powerpoint and onenote on it
so this is almost an unbelievable bargain
so that concludes my experience with the new vision
I'm a fan of these Amazon
is this matrix pad a z4 is an Android tablet
Amazon ecosystem is locked down
they put ads and stuff like that
they don't have the Google Play Store
press a little button power button
alright so hopefully this is all pretty straightforward now
looks like a pretty nice tablet and in fact
one this is a little like widescreen
you shouldn't expect like premium
let's just kind of impressive
throw it in here on any of my
the switches are on the top portion
I just want to take a look inside the box
see what else would get so
compared to the fire tablet otay constructionwise
this might feel a little bit
I said I mean you can decide right
that is something you don't really have to sweat right
you can take it on trips
put it through its paces
let your kids use it
hi everyone welcome back to my channel today
I will tell you about this way
let's quickly check it out
the features are mentioned on the box
like double side usable active area
LPI resolution it went nine two levels of pressure sensitivity
thank you for choosing my own
and this was this tablet
I will show you how to use it first
let's see the other contents
then this is the pen
it is a battery free pen
so you don't need to charge it
these are the extra nibs for the pen
this is the user manual okay a Quick Start Guide
the branding is here or on
let's see how it is so this is the back
my only pending is also here
let's see how the tablet fits in the bag
ok you need to connect this
here let me show you
I'm gradually increasing the pressure
so the bar will move up like this
I am not changing it
just click on apply and click
OK now let's quickly test it with Photoshop
let me open recently save document
I was drawing a sketch of corner
let's do it with this tablet one more thing
press this button to erase it
you can write your name
you can write anything on it to make quick notes
I have mentioned in the description of this video
what you think about it
they're going to be sold for $30 extra
the pictionary game is particularly noteworthy
TV in your living room
we're happy to see it more on
Buck Lightner we'll see you next time
now let's quickly open up the pack
where is it for protection
they have bubble wrap did okay
let's not really open up this sealed box
is there at the top
there is an headphone jack and a charging port
ID right there is in volume rockers
MP camera with their company logo fit
that's really good thing and it's charging are up sure
now let's test the sound quality of this okay
only obtuse sounds epic so non full
what's the impression is running off
okay now let's check out the storage space almost 1
GB is used out of 16 GP
this is the one to go with
put sound quality and ease in camera 4
thanks for watching guys see you soon you
what is going on guys
this is a review for the dragon
it is a 720p display
so it's 1280 by 800 so slightly over 720p display
you get a camera as well at the top there
I've never seen a headphone jack
so close to the end of the tablet
let's talk about the display
I mean for a 720p plus display
they're not the best but they're not the worst
it's it's just the video that I'm recording at
it's not washed out at all
the clarity is pretty good
P in this YouTube app
you can't make them play higher than 720p
the sound is pretty bad
it does a fairly good job at that
you know just loading up a video to play
it's gonna do that fairly quick
you know most of the games
I think people play our game like this
you can have a small little gaming tablet
that does absolutely fine next
maybe play some games so you know
this doesn't have it so at that point
I'll reiterate who this tablet's for it's for kids
it's for someone that wants a secondary tablet
see you guys down the road purse
if you watch my channel you know
I'm a huge fan of the surface pro
gen coming up wanna see more videos like this
well why not hit that
subscribe button and make sure you hit that notification icon
this way you'll be alerted every time
here's a quick rundown of the specs
what you're looking at is a 13-inch 3k IPS
i5 or the core i7
LTE which I recommend but enough with the specs
let's find out what you get inside the box
let's open it up now
and you also get your keyboard cover
you get the ThinkPad pen
runs off one quadruple a battery
they give you the plastic pen holder as well
we'll get to that in a little bit
the keyboard cover is really nice
it uses a smooth finish as opposed to the Alcantara
it has strong sturdy metal hinges
LTE SIM slot as well as a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the other side
I want to thank today's sponsor
today's video is brought to you by lvl
go you one-stop-shop for Windows
ok so check this out
Microsoft Office no problem fifty
sixty-four cents becomes forty five dollars
it's a little bit cheaper thirty-nine eighty-nine becomes 35 ninety
that's a three thousand by two thousand resolution
you also getting a three by two aspect ratio
that's my favorite aspect ratio
and it's a very bright display coming in at 415
it's great for both indoor and outdoor use
the blacks are very deep
that's because this will be used as a tablet
the pen itself has 4096 levels of pressure
I didn't lose the pen and it stayed in
its silo the whole time now
I think they did a fantastic job with it now
you're probably wondering by now
actually come glad you asked
these are quad core processors
I want to know what you think
the rear facing camera is actually pretty good considering
I was actually pleasantly surprised with it
I think they actually did a pretty good job
I'm curious to know what you think
let me know now you do get a fingerprint scanner
it's on the right side
they just don't get loud enough
this didn't give me a rich sound
the good news is you do get a 3.5
this is a very portable device
absolutely this is an excellent two-in-one
I love its gorgeous design
I'm not crazy about its battery life
it won't last all day
so what do you think about the lenovo
thinkpad x1 tablet 3rd gen
this is built like a tank
the display is really gorgeous
it's a 3k display no complaints on that front
they're actually pretty weak so
performance was very good out of its eighth generation
this is built like a tank
the rock solid build quality and the overall great looks
I'll do my best to try to make that happen
don't forget to check me out on
we are doing a review on a tablet
and also i've never seen this before as well
this is a first for me
so it's been tested by google
is that painting not sure could be
so that's about it there you go ips
google likes they've been tested by google
this is the gb version
well very nice warranty card
what's that so activate your warranty visit blah blah blah
i will read that later
shall we not on very well
it looks like on off button now
okay so it takes a headphone socket
which is good should have done that
i wasn't expecting that added bonus
well i look right don't i
and what's this looks like a screen protector
i would say that was the screen protector
that is the screen protector in there
i'm not going to use it yet
but that is very good and the manual
this is a quick guide
i believe let go and there
she goes so that was an opposite
that should just go dark
how'd you get out of that
so that's quite a nice little feature
yeah we know about that
don't worry so what else is up here your settings
so here's all your settings battery 96
yeah it's almost fully charged
let's see if there's anything else on it
bits some quick look assistant gallery blah blah blah
i'll have a quick look at that freaky
oh it's a free gift
welcome to chrome i use earlier
so we've got set up a chrome account
we're just going to test it out for now
see how good she is no internet
so we've got to sort out the internet
i will do that right now
click on this again and we should get something
join the free vip blah blah blah
i'm not going to do anything like that
i'm sure want a free gift
so that's what that does so
so we've got kindle in there
i didn't notice that earlier
let's turn it and take a photo
oh okay that was okay
it's going to give me a natural light
i'm going to delete that
i don't need that no more delete
i thought it was pretty good
i thought was it was
this might be the baby for you
i think it's well worth that kind of money
let me know in the comments
i think it's well worth that kind of money
it comes with a usb charger as a headphone socket
it doesn't cost you any money
thank you very much for watching me you
this is a $60 tablet offered by
we have our volume rocker
love the form factor of this tablet
and when we put it up against the 2019
the m7 definitely comes ahead in the form factor
Department it's got much smaller bezels
and the back is fully constructed of aluminum
but what about the internal specs
good up to one terabyte
unfortunately they did not add
even though this is running
Android go an extra gig or even a half
even some of the lower end ones now
up does take a little bit of time
this thing doesn't get that loud
I said Netflix is a very well
Wi-Fi chip that they chose to use in this unit
megabits per second upload 22.8
so to wrap this up
and there's lots of stutters going on
emulation using the drastic emulator
I figured I'd go ahead and test out ps1 now
m7 isn't the best performer
see tab s6 but it's a really expensive unit
in my opinion it is the best
we should be able to do
they're gonna be on sale for
I really appreciate you watching if you have any questions
now here is something new again
now this is um a pebble gear
i would say so definitely now
this comes with the tablet itself
the bumper case charger basic manual
it's virtually exactly the same thing now
so i'm not quite sure what happens after one year
do you have to resubscribe
uh do you have to pay like a small fee
i don't know we'll soon find that
find out after one year now
this is the tablet itself seven inches on the back
there's also the rocker and down
a nice wallpaper can be changed
you have a printer account you press it
i'm going to turn away or enter the password
there we go so i'm in now with this
you can really change everything
so this first page is what we call stats
it's the usage of the actual device
my boy hasn't really been playing that much
the best thing about this is actually
you can actually see what they have been doing
this is my little boys screen very simple again
you can change the wallpaper
the store is there so let's log into the store
it's called the game store and in here
we select categories and again learn books media now
it's all there and play of course fun
why not give him something to play
isn't it evo lands on here
this is free of charge
two's on here galagas on here special edition
little game to play man
miss pac-man's on here you're probably thinking
i'm not gonna lie all right
let's play all the games
i haven't really downloaded anything
this is where the problem lies right
let's go for the frozen book movie all right
let me see if i got the volume on here
all right here we go come on
there's no volume some of these books
actually have you can actually listen to them talking
maybe this one's the reading book
ah there you go an amazing snowman
yay olaf is not your everyday snowman
his brother marshmallow is a playful fellow
he is indeed a playful fellow
they can cost a pretty penny and we have
we do know a lot of kids
no adverts nothing you can completely protect your child
pioneer finally released this 9-inch tablet and it's pretty cool
this is the pioneer wt 7600 nex
and it's a floating screen digital receiver
installed parking assist sensors swiping down on the home screen
you can access the suggestion pages
i was expecting to be a little bit more responsive
but if you don't mind that then it's perfectly fine
pioneer is the best in class for doing so
tones and the colors will be reflected
this is one of my favorite features
you can even change the clock font
that's interesting because not even the iphones
i really like how they did
the graphic design because makes it very easy to understand
what's going on and take for example time alignment
they did it pretty well
we have a bunch of basic connectivity options
such as bluetooth and wi-fi one thing
i forgot to mention this unit offers
so that's it for this video
it doesn't cost you anything and it's always free
hey how's it going everyone
i'm nathan with the ebookreader.com for this video
so i reviewed the first one back in 2017.
it's got an aluminum frame and it's very thin
it comes with a stylus for writing on the screen
actually there are two different options for the stylus
there's a white one and a black one
they have the same kind of feel to them
the latency is virtually non-existent
uh so here's kind of a look at the different
so i'll get more into that later
uh sports epub pdf files
you can send files as well a required internet connection
the remarkable has wi-fi for transferring files
you've got to use the remarkable app
they have them for mobile devices
it's just basically one solid level
you've got the undo option right here
you can do undo redo
you've got three different colors obviously the white
they have this conversion feature well
it'll convert your handwritten notes
uh but then you know it works pretty well
it's more accurate than onyx's uh conversion feature
i set up a different test
we've got the different sections
you have your sections for your notebooks
you got your section for favorites
you've got all your quick links along
let's go over into the settings menu
i'll show you a couple of different things in here
so that's where the wi-fi comes in
it has three per row all right
you can write notes on ebooks as well
so you got like the freehand highlighting here
so it's a little bit different than your you know
so one thing worth mentioning
we're looking at right now
it's actually a wikipedia article
they have a google chrome extension
you've also got the search
you do have like different
i would like them to have a contrast darken feature
but it doesn't because as you can see here
the text is a little bit light
some devices have a way to darken
and that is kind of nice
but the responsiveness is pretty good
so here's just a listen to the sound difference
direct sunlight doesn't phase it at all ipad full brightness
you can't really even see anything
hey how's it going guys
this is one of the poorest screens
what makes it look bad
it's easier to look at the pixelated
well put and it's easy to take off too
it may take some time getting used to at first
but there's no writer left
the tablet is packed with mediatek 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor
1 gig of ram a arm
the tablet runs smoothly when lightly browsing the web
and doing some other basic tasks
there wasn't much of a slowdown especially with 3d games
more graphic heavy games ended up being slow and shoppi
this is what the monitor looks like on my desk
the screen is big and has a variety of colors
the pen is comfortable to hold and easy to use
the stand that comes with the table is not attached
you have to attach it yourself
it's important to check as that's why
I thought my monitor wasn't working after downloading a driver
the transition from drawing tablet to monitor was so smooth
drawing on the monitor is easy and really fun
that is so clear and so big
I can't carry around and start up work
which isn't a problem since
this is a monitor and not a tablet
I can't carry around and stop work
which isn't a problem since that's expected
personally this will only be a problem when
I don't use the Wacom tablet at home now
I think it'd be cool to have the pen connected
it also works well with paint tool sai and Photoshop
it runs like a computer with a pen
I hope you get to try this amazing product
thank you for watching you
i am your host ty in today's episode
i'm going to give the device a proper overview
the tablet will cost you
299 green stamps but hold up buster me
let's keep it moving now
the lg g-pad 5 has a simplistic but functional design
and i say that to say this
the lg g-pad 5 does have an aluminum back
i am feeling the aluminum
i managed to grab some footage with this tablets camera
oh man this is terrible
it wasn't that painful or was it
alright let's keep it moving
now this is not the fastest fingerprint sensor
i've used but it works and it works
well i like the ship
this is not a deal breaker
the display is crisp with a decent amount of brightness
some photos some light gaming on a larger screen
let's see what the software is all about
moving the device has a 8200 milliamp hour cell
the battery is definitely on point
all right let's keep it moving connectivity
personally i am over the headphone jack
you guys can keep it all right keeping it moving
let's check out the hardware
just a few years ago
the snapdragon 821 is a good mid-range processor
don't make the mistake i made
i thought i could use this
32 gigabyte tablet to edit my short videos
and damn was i wrong
this is just not the tablet
for that the lg g pad 5 will cost you
i'll catch y'all on the rebound
hello everyone and welcome to droidforums net
I bring to you the tech glass
tpad x98 air 3g tablet
this tablet is quite a unique device
8.1 tablet with office 365 as well now
I'm only evaluating the Android side
and you're ready to go of course it has
I'm pleased to see there's a an SD card slot
welcome feature a micro-hdmi port
there needed to be a place for the antennas
you'll see a pair of speakers
ok and i can scroll through it
everything moves pretty nicely and fluidly
this tablet boasts a 6.7 627
you have the all-important charging block
this is a two and a half half charger
let me pick this one up for just a second
this is actually an adapter
I want to take you over to the gallery
I want to show you some impressive photos here
I'm going to turn this to landscape mode
the gallery really does show this device off
display turned down because it overpowers the camera
so you're going to see the background
this are just absolutely gorgeous
that's your iPad air in an Android tablet
all the expected settings and functionality
you'll see a row of buttons down here
let me turn this back down again
you'll see a row of buttons toward the bottom here
you've got your standard home
button your back button and your background apps running button
it doesn't provide any functionality in the home screen
I believe this is a great device
they have everything from phones to tablets to accessories
you might just find that
you're pleasantly surprised at what they have
best thread at the link below thank you
this was just created before
Windows 10 came out as for the installation CD
not including the stands which is quite big
you'll need a lot of desk
it's very customizable and sturdy at every angle
now that we've gone over the specs
that is only noticeable when zoomed in and
it's always good practice to color
the group wasn't there but I didn't really miss it
I also found that the display did not easily scratch
it's very similar to the comp ends with a raised
Ridge and slightly raised buttons
the weight of the pen is towards the tip
the nibs have some gifts but feel sturdy
the lines are very fluid and easy to control
I didn't notice very much
I think this is a good entry
it's definitely still useful on Amazon
thank you all so much for watching you
but is it any good?
Windows button which works like the Windows key
but seriously don’t take pictures with a tablet.
GHz along with 2GB of RAM.
Performance is impressive as Windows
RT runs extremely smoothly practically everywhere in the OS.
at which point the tablet slows down considerably.
There are pluses and minuses
to this, for example battery
RT is still clearly a 1.0
release and the illusion shatters.
The price is really where it hits home.
The Surface RT starts at $499 for 32GB
however you basically need the Touch
Cover to get everything out of it
which brings your total to $599.
but right now it just isn’t.
Like button if you enjoyed!
Anyway guys, I will catch you in the next one!
and you know my plastic oled
another review about collagen tablet research guys
so i'm going to show you this chocola bb
i think you're already familiar with this product
uh collagen so 120 tablets
and i'm gonna little guys
yeah and ingredients okay so we have now here
and that's all for our collagen review
the toshiba thrive just weighs under 1.66
you have a very nice rubberized
the biggest downside towards this tablet is its overall shape
it's extra long kind of shape doesn't really make sense
one of the best things about it is its functionality
this tablet runs an nvidia tegra 250 processor
looks like in real life
it really reflects some of its specifications
the colors are fairly vibrant
it has both bluetooth version
i'm sure you can get better if you monitor
how many things are running in the background
keep in mind that this tablet does also run flash
this actually runs android honeycomb 3.1
tablets that use non-flash mediums
currently the toshiba thrives comes in three different versions
you have the age 16 and 32 gig versions
the nice thing is thanks to the sd card slot
thanks to its hdmi connection
which is great for presentations
models is better heat management systems
this is going to be increasingly important
i think this is a fantastic tablet device
i believe it's really a no-brainer
we will be testing this
we're going to be doing some direct
I'm going to be reviewing the Wacom
don't really tell you so without further ado
this is the video review on the
Wacom Bamboo capture tablet the included software with the Wacom
I think it's a point
I do graphic design SketchBook
Pro is a pretty powerful tool
is the additional like tools that you have inside
that wind press have a different function
there is no no wireless included with the bamboo
US dollars one thing you do want to note
that is included with the bamboo
capture does not include an eraser now
I read some reviews online
that said that it did before
then the bamboo capture is for you
the bamboo capture tablet from welcome
they had some neat stuff with the screen
it does have a nice display though
it's one of the new fan list chips from Intel
M chips chipset based computers
comparative is the asus ux305
that has the same chip
the magnets will kind of line up
it really is a yeah sort
I thought was a very disturbing decision here
these keyboards are very low
the screen will translate all of that motion
you have a volume rocker up and down
the windows button is here
and then you have a headphone microphone
SD card slot for putting on some external storage
all the hardware decisions aside
this actually does perform quite well the core
M processor has been something
well we're gonna take a look at that now
it renders the page relatively quickly
they don't sound very good
Wi-Fi yet does have AC and supports 5 gigahertz channel
so you're gonna get some of the newer
Wi-Fi access points working with this without issues next
real quick is pop open
I go but you can see though it does
you know we're processing web browsing email
but you'll get a computer
Windows tablets running the full version of Windows 8.1
that cost about a hundred bucks
hey what is up guys
here and over the past couple of days
I've been asked a lot about the Nvidia shield tablet
I'm really not much of a gamer at all
so this is a short video
let's take a look so first of all this
has some pretty beastly specs
it's got a pretty standard array of ports headphone jack
drivers really aren't even that good
grill is the front-facing camera
they're really stiff and have almost zero travel
there's dedicated software hub and everything but like
tablet running almost pure stock
I put the Google experience launcher on here
does it feel really familiar and comfortable
Android with no skin and that beastly NVIDIA k1
everything is fast fluid and smooth
it's a little on the warm side
I fired up an application that honestly on any other
but you've probably experienced yourself
it's made just for the shield
it's like a felt-tip pen and it kind of rocks
I really couldn't even tell the difference
how that throttles they also added
HDMI settings since there's a mini HDMI port
and of course settings for any controller
so that's a good sign for this new tablet
you know what those rumors of an 8-inch volantis
Nexus tablet with front-facing speakers
let's talk about a huge huge outfit in the room
do you get more power
the torque dip is almost completely done
this is exactly where the more power thing comes from
when you're flooring it you hit 3k rpms
become a rocket so yes
I want to talk about the open
I'm not trying to say that open
flash tablet the news market for these
I picked mine up for three hundred and fifty dollars
I don't like about the tune the tablet
I've noticed that with this tune
the car runs a lot more smoothly
it's almost stalling with the tune
that problem is completely gone
shell just feels cheap for five hundred dollars brand-new
I really don't like about this tablet
coding which leads me to my next point
I'm gonna scribe it in three words
that's more than three words
you have to go on their confusing website
and don't get me started on if you want to
I've ever been through in my life
the point is just like the open
I recommend the open flash tablet yes I would
it works whatever the reason
I say that I wouldn't buy it
I have the first version
that's it other than that
the two tablets work exactly the same
is that the version 2 is better
I'd like to hear what you guys think
I hope this video has helped
thank you so much for watching
you have any more questions again
feel free to ask in the comments below
I'll catch you guys next time peace out
i'll be showing you the process
we'll be looking at this
time is a gaumon m106k pro
it's a brand new model
that you tap with your pen
oh and bags for all of those things
i recommend getting an extra pen
i'll be breaking down the process
i use when animating basically i'll just be showing you
a character say for an animation
meme or a gif or a gif
that's what i'll be using here
i bet you'll never guess what character we'll be animating
yeah now let's get started first things first
think of what you want to animate
i even put my pen on the screen
think about the timing backgrounds color
it's time to get started
i always start by sketching out my key frames
all you have to do with this
stage is lay out the motion or action
then you'll know what to use later on a tip
i guess there's plenty of videos
you've got your rough sketch down
it's time to start adding some more structure
you don't have to fill in every single frame
it will save time if you pick and choose
but they turned out to be really useful
you can set your shortcut keys to common buttons
keys this tablet's quality is great for the price
it's a pretty good tablet
it might be a little bit confusing for beginners though
you'll be left with this little gap here
i've got it's the hawaiian inspiroi
you can't really see it very well
um what i'm going to do now
but you might want to change the orientation to portrait
perhaps to do that way you can change to pen
i've got my button on the pen
you see the buttons on here
let's get a little close up on that one
so they've got a top button and a bottom button
my top button is the right
is it so press it over here
you can shift it you can out
um colors already organized so you basically just start drawing
we want the picker tool
so let's get that and then bucket fill
oops that's not going to work
fill that in anywhere else
it's not amazing is it
but it's can i fill that in there
uh bucket fill that one
i think that was like a quick one
whoa really easy there okay
there's my goofy whoops there we go
that's obviously a quick jobby and obviously you can
this one i think is is called the practice side
but that's what this side is for
you do all your good stuff on here
so that's it from me
i hope you've enjoyed this video
thanks for joining me on this
uh i'll catch you later on
see you later bye you
what is what and then
we've got a full-blown 1ul in seven
different languages that is also
it's really nice doesn't slide
it's really comfy to hold
so that is the tablet itself
obviously expandable with the memory card
they say 2020 and so very up-to-date
we've got the storage manager which will remove some apps
pretty self-explanatory in terms of display
I would just say the cameras there
but that's that when it comes to recording video
the back facing camera is 720p
the front-facing camera is 480p
you don't need anything else
C - full USB a adapter
it is a full-blown word as well which works really
how many characters you've got in your text as well
I have to admit for the price you pay
it's a pretty decent device
you can watch movies on it
you can listen to music on it
you can create documents on it you can edit
I'm using which mice I'm using
that's they the these are the devices
I wanted to touch on
it lasts days it lasts days
I'll speak to you soon guys bye
10 is Amazon's newest tablet
it's got better resolution a more powerful processor
plus it has some other significant improvements
keep making more videos here on
the most obvious is size
well the 10 here allows for 32 and 64 gigabytes
the camera is also different
the 10 definitely faster than the 8 though
I couldn't get it to work at least this time
I could sue the Smart Home gadgets
I already had connected inside the app
it might be a big drawback for some shoppers
the speakers on this tablet get pretty loud
but they're good holding the tablet horizontally
so using that app is a bit of a mystery
and you demand responsiveness and a slight lag
it would drive you nuts then
there can watch enjoy and learn from until next time
find me on twitter and instagram at aaron ly
hello a couple weeks ago
this is one of those drawing tablets
the answer is priced the
there are cheaper larger tablets out there like the
Huon 18 inch but with a lot of those tablets
I haven't used the latest Wacom 13 inch
it feels solid the screen and the quality
that's none of that online
the hardware buttons along the side are mapped to things
I'm used to thinking of touch commands
having a real scroll wheel dedicated to that
spend me up quite a bit now
the included stylus was much lighter than what
I'm used to working with
the stylus is standalone also like many
there's a little bit of resistance to the screen
seems like on my old
Wacom that matte surface seemed to dim the screen
but that wasn't the case here
I want to touch upon
anyway actually confirm that with the artists
own rep who said yeah
who knows maybe my hands were just filthy
you can definitely tell it there is a
I want to call it a gap but the gap
the glass is a little bit thicker
and you definitely tell that it's offset from the screen
a little bit again only something
I've ever used so if you want to learn more
it's really cool drying up
I will see you in a few weeks you
so this is what you get inside the box
then you get the pen itself
the pen is battery free
that's worth noting so you don't have to charge this
it's really very very good indeed
it's much much more natural
you're getting so much value for money
i can certainly highly recommend it of note
that's on the pdf manual available on their website
thank you very much for watching
i really do appreciate it
there are links down in the video description
there's also a link down there to the veek website
i'll see you next time
so is this for beginners or not
this is the kind of video
I have no idea about that game
the tablet runs about $30 on Amazon
there is one version five dollars
this tablet is tiny almost uncomfortably
this tablet has 3 programmable
and whatever you want it's all set up through the
Wii on pin tablet driver
it's a large cone and a little less springing
and it came with a few extra nibs
it never became fully functional
so that's a big part to take into account
that is the bet aside
let's draw this is some footage
I captured while drawing with it on my PC
when it came to details in color it was great
the pen has a nice weight to it
I found myself getting lost
remember the active area on
this tablet is 4 inches by 2
it was even more painful to draw
it works fine with both paint tool
Sai and Medibank paint Pro so all in all
I recommend it to beginners
I wish I could have gotten my first tablet
become graph ir4 for that cheap
this isn't the only cheap tablet out there though
this is just a smidge bigger than the
Beyond but lacks three buttons on the side
the buttons on the pen are customizable
so there is another option
I hope this kind of helped anybody
thanks for watching and I'll see you next week it
it should be this week
i'll talk to you soon
so what comes in the box
when you open up your sense labs tablet
i want to start off with the carrying case
you also get three shortcut keys on the top
there is on the top left section
so this is a huge benefit for me
i thought it was a nice touch
the drawing experience is a lot better on the sense
i think what senselab did here is amazing
i did confirm from them
they are coming out with a display tablet
um you guys should check out senselabs
it's a great great alternative to wacom
like i think this feels better than anything
i'm gonna leave it here
i'm gonna end it here for you guys
good day good weekend have a good life guys
love you peace so you
hello this is simason corner
banggood sent me this to review
good standard what you get in
the box is no more or less than the essentials
you need to get started
you enter your google account details
i've reviewed quite a few products in my time
i ran and at the end of the video
you will find my summary and verdict
i'm not running this clip in real time
i also want to mention now
p80x does have this capability
what do these numbers mean
we managed about half that here
but we're not done here yet
hello this is simracing nice
um wow that's metal as well
i have to say i did know that
can you see the screen there
it's got plenty of charge comes
disable the lasers blocking the hallway
the terminal should accept your fingerprint
now what killed him i did
you'll need for this level
hopefully it'll be too busy with zombies
watch out the security guard has just activated what sorry
it wasn't powered so i missed it
i'm sorry for this complication
it's really snappy everything i've thrown at it runs great
the screen is bright and clear
millimeter jack to plug in your own headphones
should you want to the battery
it's very solid check out other reviews
read the user reviews on the banggood product page
it's top marks for most users
it is a winning combination
it's the right price for a good all-round performer
and i do love a bargain
okay let's wrap up the review
hello youtube today is Saturday februari 20th 2016
and maybe they're gonna do new
and this is the sony
i love mine in july 2015 and
so why would they stop doing that
and as you can see it is pretty nondescript
I read somewhere some I possibly Albert Einstein
they are living by that
it is not much to see either
you have a sony logo and an xperia logo
i have it open in many times
you have the volume rocker and the volume
are there no speakers on this thing
there is a problem with the speakers
there is a very slight lip on the plastic
the surface is fraction of a millimeter above the the
I'm traveling I don't really know why i buy these
the magazine is tiny tiny bit thinner and they also
read news surf the web
check my email with this
I can only read whatever they written in this issue
which is you know boring
it is a 10.1 inch at IPS
inch quad HD which means 2560 by 1600 pixels
that was a big problem
LG v10 phone because of the Bob
I don't know it was because of the overheating problem
its got three gigs of ram
millimeters and this version weighs in at approximately 375 grams
if you're doing that you're doing it wrong
so those are the specifications of the set for tablets
HD 10 inch displays and it is pretty nice
it is what sony call a triluminos display
i'm not entirely sure what that means
but if you go and talk to erica griffin
i'm sure she can tell you all about it
it was basically perfect out of the box
it came out when it first came out
they had a lot of problems with it
because it overheated and it also overheated in
I never had any problems with it
I'm in the middle of something
I haven't actually played this for some time
yeah no that's not a good idea
alright this is not a good game
I'm going to skip out of this
which is a new game
I think it's just going to one of these
we go deletion the reason
I like this game so much
I wish there were more games like this
I need from my tablet in terms of power
LaVista deadly you enter the world of pain burn
is you know personal opinion or speculation
I can change the size
of course they can make it bigger or smaller
they could make it thinner
they could make it lighter
all right you can make it thinner
it's not going to make a big difference
I don't think that will make much of a difference
it's going to be an improvement
it's nice but it's not that big a step really
it's just incremental improving something
same goes for the sony scheme
these days they try to make it close to stock
because they couldn't really get any better than the said
I think they're in the same situation with the tablet
they can't really do anything more to it making it
you know a big step forward
it is still in my opinion
the best android tablet out there
because i use is every day seriously
I use it every day
I use it when traveling
i usually run at home
you know everything in tablet is all about
that's what I use it for
then you should probably take a look at that because
you can get more round
the apps are not made to be multitasked in android
I can play two games
you can't even see them in the PlayStation Store
it is a good platform to play that game
and that's a big game
I think we need to see for tablets to you
then why should you pay extra for this
you know there's no point so for
it's running the 801 chipset
yeah the business is in a difficult position right now
I'm looking forward to that
I think you need to start looking at the software
get those games pushing the machines
so that's my opinion on that
hey guys peter here with judy bridge calm
we have the nuke 7 tablet
you might be saying well
this has been out for a while
it didn't cause too clear anyways
here's some specs you can read on the back
I'm not going to lie
it's going to be very reflective
yeah we have the back
the back kind of has its own personality
you see that you have a center eyes camera
a hard reset button and a dedicated microUSB port
we're not going to show you
I mean they're all capable of playing
Play Store Google Chrome or settings
so we're just going to start
we're going to go to nuke audiobooks here
I shouldn't chose that one
you can buy these in the text
so it's kind of like a filler app
thanks for the set up
you do have a page animation
it's kind of like oh
I'll grab the top corner of the page
you know something like that
so yeah it's very cool
in that regard you have text size changes
let's go back to there
I screwed that up but the yeah
we're not going to go through
every single one of those
this video would be 20 minutes long
nuke shop is where you actually buy your content
I like the way they do this
what do you think lots of cool stuff here
we're going to go back to
so you can click the middle
it's better than just reading the table of contents
well look at some sunglasses
that was really good for magazines
it's not worlds apart in size so the screen size
it always has been and yeah
3000 milliamp battery is gigantic
it's also expandable up to 128 gigs via SD card
we're wrapping up here so
I'm just going to say this
that was like when that came out
they're all capable of playing asphalt 8
they got this cookie cutter black layout they
I haven't changed much in the last little while so
this tablet is really good though
I'm glad they went back they got Android 6.0
I don't really like that
what do you guys think about this
sorry for the long video
it doesn't work on its own
it's not like normal tablets
it feels quite spacious gama
it's a little over a kilo which is quite light
it has a good amount of keys
you just need to be loft a protective layer
that's always so satisfying suiting to do like
I love peeling off labels and stuff like that
it comes with a stand
you need to know what's happening in the back
you can't do it because you can't screw it in
that's a little bit of a boomer
it's grey outside and orange inside
which are the common colors
so it's good but it's a little tight
the pen is the classic camel pen design
it hasn't changed at all
it has 8,192 pressure levels
you're gonna need them because
Gambel pen nibs get worn out pretty easily
I don't know a thing you like a lot about
this tablet is that they reduce a lot
the amount of wires a usually gamin pen display tablet
have more wires than this
do we sell the tablet
you just need to go through their website
the installation process is pretty straightforward
you have to press for a few seconds
took me a while to figure that out the ring
you're using and one makes you scroll up and down
I really really like this
the layers of the display are glued together
Gangwon cursor position is not 100% accurate
but it's not 100% precise and it's worth mentioning that
the pen is very responsive as always and alike
it's not so much considering that
I have a very old laptop as you might know
that doesn't work really well because of that
the color should be quite accurate
so it should be pretty accurate
I'm trying to simplify my style
because that's the only thing
I'm basically only drawing digitally lately
hey can you believe that it's crazy anyway
I made so many mistakes
I think I worked everything at the end
it looks a little creepy
it's also something after practice on
I don't remember anything of that
the problem is that I forgot everything in you
that's it for this video
it's time to add some more power for this
we sought out open flash performance
headers for a stock card
that you just want to run on e85
you'd use the stage 2 equal length header tune
we decided to start off with the stage
all you do is select the tune
check out that link in the description
let's talk about how the stage 1 tune feels immediately
at how much more linear the
and that's no longer the case overall
it does provide a much more enjoyable driving experience
it's an easy process and only takes about 10 minutes
to put it through its paces
we're going to be uploading some more
TV project BRZ with its newfound horsepower
BRZ is probably nearing its completion
we've just turned up a couple notches
that's it for this episode
thanks again for watching everyone
we'll see you next time you you
hi my name is Ashley
so that can be used once
hdmi displayport so unfortunately this one there is no wired
how fast and there we go
obviously this is a latitude
I looked not much of work
you'll be able to see that it is very fast
it loads within seconds again we can use the touchscreen
Windows 10 do you want the tournament's tablet mode
so this way will rotate with you
it can be used as a replacement for a laptop
not happy to answer them
hi everyone this is david from geek enoyed
you're not going to lose it
I'm going to be showing you on screen
I can actually configure what each button does at
then this second button here
I can configure the touch speed
now let's pop into iPhoto and here
I'm going to select my paint
I'm painting on the canvas here
it is usable as a proper graphics tablet as well
I've been very impressed with the bamboo
then you're going to pay around about 155 pounds
well thank you very much for listening
this is bottom in my review of the
Wacom Bamboo fun pen and touch
let's see how this goes
I already redesigned S&T twice
this is her modern version
I got came with the tablet
I really appreciate because I'm bad
I think I'm finally ready to start
I started by pulling his dreads into a ponytail
a sort of angular pattern then
here's a character design tip
voila the sketch is done
I started with the basics
you know red fur a slightly darker tan muzzle
and here's the final product
I think this turned out really cool
working fairly decently from what
it worked perfectly all in all
I'm definitely going to use this tablet way more often
if you're looking for a good screen tablet
that isn't too heavy on your wallet
that has nothing to do with any sponsorship
hey guys it's neon and I'm here with pinky boo
but the thing about this one is
this is a $399 tablet
we're gonna unbox it galette
pinky boo do the unboxing
then we're gonna do some art
yep let's flip this over there we go okay
what comes that little hard
we go there we go
let's get started like the walking one to your computer
install the way is drive and register your tablet
so let's see what we got in the box
alright yep this is oh that's white
well we're gonna get pinky boo using this tablet
yeah let's see here so
I don't know this is a yes stylus is
chargin okay lots of wires
so we're all going to hook this up
there's our instructions we're gonna hook this unit up yeah
I like how they hide their the head
let's do a size comparison of the wacom one
this is the wacom one
this is my 13-inch Cintiq
it's very sturdy but it is plastic
it's close to get sturdy
I mean it is very sturdy
compare this to the 13-inch
that's something that we do not have on the
I really like these these new cables
and then look at this
this is probably the easiest tablet
I've ever connected to a computer before
they had laptops of mind
you're probably wondering how it performs it performs like a
Wacom which is good right
I'm very impressed with the performance of this tablet again
I mean even though this unit is made of plastic
you can definitely you know
you know it's it's a wacom
there's no there's no jitter you know
it really doesn't get any better than this you know
now we're gonna be doing some drawing
we're gonna do some drawing with pinky boo
I think for beginners for students
and she's gonna do some drawing here in clip studio
yeah you want to pick a pencil
so let's um let's pick
yeah there's so we got real pencil here that's it
this is in the clip studio
so they're your real pencil
yep so you can change different tools
so does it feel like like you're drawing for real
it's actually yeah it's a one thing
I think I mentioned it before
is that the stylus on
they'd be here neither ways
no pressure no pressure chalk
that hasn't mean that it feels like actual pencil right
I don't know what pose I'm trying to do here
I'm just like mixing him all together
nice thing about this because Peggy B
who's never worked digitally before well
they do and you can you know
Photoshop actually works really good in this too
I've noticed that I knew dude
I know I do have one
she looks like she's from
Steven universe he's new thread jiminy
I'm going to wrap this up
I think it's a really good tablet for the price
it does start at $399 for a
it's what you would expect from
Wacom the pen pressure as I understand
the tilt angle support is 60 degrees
I know those of you out there
want to know those numbers those specs
I think it's it's pretty much identical
I purchased in the past again for $399
you're getting a pretty good tablet
I mean you're getting a really good tablet
it's very very easy to hook up
I said it hooks up fantastically in my laptop
it's a great portable option personally
I like drawing on a bigger screen
but if you're on the go
you know pinky boo she's 12
it's definitely for the money
it's a buy for me again
I think it's a great entry point now
i think it's a great starting point
Wacom tablet I recommend it
I'll put a link in the description
you can buy one if you're interested
great little unit actually exceeded my expectations again
the price point is fantastic for
we'll talk to you guys later
thanks so much for watching
hey guys thanks for watching clownfish
TV please consider supporting the channel

I've been enjoying the experience
it's got some good improvements over the previous version
Amazon's Fire HD 8 is a small tablet
plus you can add more it
lets you do a lot of things like read ebooks
listen to audio books watch streaming
I was watching after that
you can download other apps as you wish the button
placements are all along the top of the device
there are some changes and improvements over the previous versions
I've personally had a chance to try
HD storage has been increased as well
atmos speaker which we'll talk about in a little bit
the screen is ok just ok
shot with it right now so
so there's a bit of an improvement there now
the camera has had some tweaks made to it though
the audio quality on the tablet is good
this tablet comes loaded with apps and productivity tools
so you can download other apps you might want
adapter there's also a microSD slot for external storage
I didn't do the whole drain the battery test
the tablet comes preloaded with audible for audiobooks
I hope that changes soon
Alexa to function and annoyingly
but it just shows as offline so again
I hope the Alexa issue is resolved soon
it is also much less expensive
you're definitely going to pay for it
you may already have getting the all new
Fire HD 8 is a no brainer
you can read more about it online at tech gadgets
Canada com I've got a full write-up there
I hope everyone out there can watch and enjoy
I'm at Erin lyy see
hello and welcome together media
I'm grant Abbott and today
I'm reviewing the huion H s 64 so hurry on
maybe students maybe as students
please don't contact me if they don't work though
it all worked really smoothly out of the box
it didn't seem to work in my sort of galaxy
they're all the same really to be honest
tablets that have 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity and
are they happy with the product
Wacom screen in the background there
it's a really good graphics tablet
it's very comfortable to use
I don't know about the Ducks personally
so it's a really good buy anyway
and thanks to huion for sending me the tablet
inch 1900 by 1200 display on
i was really surprised by this
we've got this mediatek processor again
i could run a few videos
we've got a little bit of battery magic here
is this not a good piece
and guess what there's great news for you
so let's talk input methods
i will mention the lenovo
duet chromebook does support usi style styluses
if not i will not do anything
we've got two cameras on here
maybe you saw the entire series
let's talk about the speakers
let's talk form factor and build
i think you'll all agree with me on
i have so i guess
lenovo does include a little
but that adapter goes into the usbc port
the price point is awesome
i am very very impressed with this overall
everyone so that's the end of the review
you know what to do now
and here's what we've got coming up next
this is the part of the video where i go
what do you want to see
what do you want me to talk about
what questions do you have about this device
i had to make you wait
I want to take a look at this
thank you very much gearbest as you can see
let's go over a few specifications of it for you
Pipo mine go into Android Pipo Android
Windows this thing is pretty fragmented in the way
they've installed everything onto the hard drive
I mean not the hard drive
so we're back into Windows again
then let's find out what we're looking for here
well here we are in the disk map windows
so that's where you can recover the tablet from which
is there not not necessary at all
it's a nice little tablet
actually it runs quite quickly there
we go it runs quite quickly
it's 86 pounds 80 pence at the moment
I mean you know so many at a time
it's very easy to close windows down like the browser
HDMI and a mini USB
there's one of the cameras we have a
here are the accessories you get with it
from the guys at gearbest it had a fairly outdated
I'll show you how I had to do it
I had to find it via the file server
I think there are a few updates
Windows actually to be honest with you
I don't try this so paint 3d yet
it seems to run alright on here so oops
can we get rid of it
it goes back to the desktop again
we've got the file server open as well
there we go they just shows you
let's take a look at the camera then
I can see what it's like
I hopefully you can see it
ticking off down the bottom here
this is recording the video for us
I've just taken guys taking off down the bottom here
this is recording the video force
you just got a little loan there
what you're used to using
will you ref programs so you got the choice
there tablet mode or proper desktop
it works well enough for me
I've got my favorite magazine installed on here
Guns & Ammo read that regularly
it's it's a nice little tablet
it's quite small and compact
this was a a bit of a hybrid
it's just a long press and there it
I've got this little Bluetooth keyboard connected up here
let's have a look for gearbest
then we'll hit the enter key
Geir best comm or wherever you like
really soon as they sent us the little tablets
I've got here because of a larger one
they're a little small laptop which should be quite good
I'd say this is just
this is running quite nicely off of this little
I'm thinking they're getting one
that's more or less the same size as this
we were the larger keys
yeah well so there we go okay guys
I hope you enjoyed taking a look at this
little pipo tablet with me today
it's quite a nice little bit of kid
whichever you like alright guys
if you did please feel free to subscribe
that would help my channel as well
you can follow me on my
just look for the how to support my channel
I've got a couple of guys already helping me there
so thank you very much so to those two guys
okay guys well thanks for popping over
oh and by the way
I go into the child
Authority for the Wi-Fi back on again
I'll just had to gone network
I'm all joined on it right
but it's only about two
Meg even not mistaken so could be better bought again
this is a child's tablet
the screens really quite good for that
a few children to watch video of that
you've got your browser fully fresh fully fledged browser there
just go through all those
setting off for my child saw this
Jensen there if you go into it
he hasn't put anything in yet
but you can put books games video
you've got two children you can have it
let's go back if you've got two children thing
I didn't get it right
they're all in all for a child
there'd be no problem there but all-in-all $37.99 an excellent
obviously expandable with the micro
USB card micro SD card
sorry the front camera is 0.3
this is kind of how the box looks so
keep on watching okay so this is in the box
okay so this is the tablet outside of the box
this will connect the tablet to your comp
and this is the size comparison with the tablet
just connect the cable from the tablet to the computer
there's no on or off button
this is the app that huion comes with
this is where you would do that
after i opened the tablet but i was wrong
it was really hard to use
my computer was very laggy as you can see
why but i couldn't figure it out
it wasn't perfect at all
so that's what i did
i'm not super experienced with it
this is how the final outcome came
i think it turned out
only a portion of the tablet
um indesign premiere you can use it
that's it for today's video slash review
i hope you all enjoyed it
what makes this tablet really
unique is the fact that it's heavily commercialized
so you can purchase it at basically any electronics store
it has a 1 gigahertz
this is actually the exact
lepen is actually a manufacturer
970 is actually the first device
Brendon lanyard cord and a squirrel like traveling AC adapter
SD card slot be hidden behind a cover
there's nothing on the bottom
you notice that the screen is extremely vibrant
and it's easy to read
and so this allows you to actually see the tablet
now this is good because in darker environments
the wifely reception is also pretty strong suits
which is another counterintuitive aspect
but again you can see here
we can shoe up to 720p
the camera does a really nice job
the left hand tablet does a pretty nice job
and you'll see that on a lot of different applications
and so it's a good tablet
and hopefully it's gonna load here
it can also see here cup
well most likely it's also going to be available here
otherwise device is a pretty generic tablet
nothing really to write home about the
a fro device was released so unfortunately it remains sukkah
this allows you to actually ask access
that's out of an Apple iPad or HP TouchPad
it's a very impressive display
Lipan tablet and we found that for the most part
Lipan tablet pc and there we go
has this very unique aspect ratio
we haven't really seen in any other tablet
impressive and the device is actually quite hefty
this has been our video first look
which is the latest commercial availability
Android q is not really out yet
that doesn't just take up space
so that's the major things there this is a generic
the barnes & noble devices
Samsung devices this one is going to be completely bare
you see you have an apps button to show you
what kind of apps are running right now
you select all the food items
grab your food and away you go
the Sam's Club app is basically a subsidiary of Walmart
Vudu app so last year
once you do you get four different highlights
you can make notes by typing on the keyboard
yeah so you can buy books on this device
this is more or less the type of interface that
Kobo has like on their main website
we don't have four speakers or even two
and you didn't get that kind of crackling
you get when something's really loud
yeah it's actually not too bad very surprising
this is a digital comic on the comiXology app
so it's pretty respectable you know for the value
that's not looking too bad
the blacks are actually pretty black
you don't see those kind of fuzzy
it sort of just isolates the specific frames
this is all this is worth it
this is going to perform super
that does a lot of things
Discordian to experience with this so I rated a bye
this video is sponsored by Squarespace
let's find out by the end of this
I'm probably gonna regret this
I don't want this piece to be just okay
Squarespace makes that super easy
I like the fiddle so I really like that
I need to find a really cheap tablet
I've got it narrowed down to two
I found this one it's a little hooey on
it is only twenty dollars so
I was a bad noise
alright here we go we got am
I going to do a full review of this tablet
don't slam it against your desk
what are we gonna find in the box
this is the tiniest tablet
I have ever seen I am just gonna gently
lay you off to the side
I might want to get a pillow now
this also comes with some other things
mostly these are just the instructions
so we've got our tablet
I I think we're ready to go here first thing
it's 50 60 bucks a month
if you can't afford that totally understand
the live space on the graphics tablet
it's a little bit bigger than a credit card
I'd say about a third bigger than a credit card
I don't think that's bad advice
zooming in isn't bad at all
I would probably erase the first couple
they did especially the lines on that character
I wouldn't let 2,000 levels of pressure sensitivity dissuade you
there was plenty of pressure for what
I found it to be a lot easier now
part of that is at this point
I just don't have to be as accurate
my hand was pretty tired
I'm used to drawing on the larger screen again
I hope that helps to know a lot of you
my horizons outside of cubing videos
plus getting my hands on a really nice
drawing tablet for free sounded pretty appealing
we got the adjustable stand a protection bag
I actually misplaced when I moved into my apartment
is that the screen protector
that comes with the tablet is bubbly
you need to pressure the bubbles out
just just just rub them out just rub them out
just rub them out man
what are you doing what are you doing
just take a credit card and rub them out
all you have to do is just rub them out
it would only take like 10 seconds
you just have to go ahead and do it
you might say that but nope you're wrong
I've tried a lot for months
they're here to stay the screen
it has a paper like sturdy feeling
the button programming interface is also convenient to use
you just select the button
the pen itself feels really satisfying against the screen protector
not really anything to complain about here
so how does the tablet perform during actual use
you may be asking well from my personal experience
I am unworthy of this
I'd give this tablet a solid thumbs up recommendation
so it's quite a pricey tablet coming in at
I believe the price is a hundred and thirty pounds
let's take a quick look
I've got to say straight off the bat
it is a nice piece of kit this
it is the best tablet that I've ever used
so maybe it's worth that price tag
it's got a really really nice surface
it's just a tactile enough to sort of
it's just because we're used to it
it's got a very very nice feeling
it was kind of instant on my screen
absolutely fine there was no issues whatsoever
the drivers work very well in the driver
its boasts a few other features
this wheel is quite nice
it does feel pretty good
it was it was a remarkable piece of kit
no problems there worked really well like
I said the drivers seemed really good
I did have with my drivers
this one's a bit tricky
now compare this to display tablets
obviously it's a completely different market
hopefully a card in the corner fire
obviously there's there's issues with that being 160 pounds
it is very similar to a
Wacom pen the nib isn't squishy
it's got tilt support as well so it this
this has everything that you'd want from your graphics
tablet rather than display tablet
I see anything hasn't got obviously it
it's got all your nibs in there
it's got your adaptors for your mobile phone in fact
it's just all fairly obvious
it's the actual feel and is it comfortable
you can actually use it like this
so it's it's quite compatible
they seem to have thought of everything
I can't test is longevity because I will
that would help other people and that'd be perfect
I think that's probably enough for me
so yes this is the best graphics tablet
I'm gonna be doing a review of the Kenton
this is actually the first non
it's got left and right handed support
Full HD resolution and a color gamut of 92% ntsc
currently this tablet retails on amazon UK at 235 pounds
the tablet came very well packaged
it came in a sturdy cardboard box which
this tablet came with you
so here's a quick look the
you do get different kinds of nibs with these
I tested out replacing one
I'm wearing compression gloves because my hands have circulation issues
this part is always a fun
everyone would be a lot more appreciative
the tablet was easy enough to set up though
and it messed up my recordings so
the drivers were really easy to download
there's no need to replace any batteries
so yeah that was definitely a plus for this tablet
the screen came with a screen protector
I presumed that you weren't supposed to take it off
the colors looked very similar
it felt a lot like working on paper
in the middle of the shortcut-keys it was easily accessible
you know unless you want to the slotting
I had is that a few times
I was pleasantly surprised with the Katy sixteen
performance was generally consistent and it felt great to use
Kenting for sending me this tablet
hi everyone and welcome back in today's video
drawing tablet this is a drawing monitor
the tablet comes very well packaged
everything is well wrapped up and protected
the logo is on the underside of the glove
so that's good and the drawing glove is really useful
then we have the pen and the pen
stand the pen is really nice
the pen also requires no charging and no batteries
the cables are as compact as possible
I'm using a default Photoshop
brush here everything today for this
video is default so default settings default brushes
I started on my demonstration piece
I began with a sketch layer then
I really enjoyed working with the tablet
I thought the performance was really good
this one sits in the middle
I have here is a really nice size for me
it is something to keep in mind
also this particular model doesn't come of a stand
it plugged into the laptop and into the power source
this is a drawing monitor
I also really liked the pen design
it's smaller than the other digital pens
I didn't see anything that was noticeable to me
I found in the past that when working in Photoshop
I had with a tablet when I was working
I did have one when I set out the tablet
the pen didn't work correctly
resetting the settings to default tends to fix anything
that's acting odd at least in my experience
that's what's helped me overall
I really like the tablet
it's a nice size it's light
the screen resolution is really good
the pen is great to use the pressure
I didn't have any problems
I know these screens are not cheap
this one is more affordable than others
but they still are an investment
Hill artwork and my thoughts on this tablet
I hope you enjoyed the review and found it
hi everyone welcome back to our channel
i'm doing a review for this kids edition
i'm not sure i'm pronouncing that right
and it's for ages three and up
so this tablet is a seven inch ips screen technology
it has front and weird cameras
and here's the front camera
oh it's not the case it's the core
and you just tie the end
there's a stand in the back
we have the camera youtube setting chrome file photos
google don't hit the bomb
the hot dog paint box sounds fun
let's see what this turns out
i'm gonna do super slam
so i just can't do it away
hello patrick jumped on top of him
I open the main box I found this little
and right out of the box
I really loved the large drawing area
I never felt cramped which is important
this tablet can also go wireless which
the tablet plugged in directly
I think this is a really awesome tablet
picker speeds up my workflow however with the current driver
I'll have those links down below in the description
thank you for 50 subscribers
that is $23 right now in
you don't have to charge it or replace batteries
it also comes with ten spare pen tips
the active area is 120 by 77 millimeters
the product weight is 130 grams
there are two color selections black and white
click on the driver tab
download the XP pengie for 30 drivers
it's always set to left
I think happens when I play osoo
it is just around the thickness of the mechanical pencil
the tablet will randomly freeze
that is a big problem when playing
the cursor never froze so thankfully that problem was solved
yeah you don't have to worry about that now
let's talk about the cable
the cable is not a micro
I will do a live
play using this tablet you yeah
if you're thinking of getting a budget tablet anyway guys
leave a like and subscribe
hello everyone a long time
no see haven't seen you since last year anyway today
it is huge when I first opened the box
there's the little card from gam on quit
you're comfortable with drawing with which
that is a case for the screen
the stand and everything can't fit in it
it's just like to protect the drawing tablet
whenever you go in this box there are chords
this is the power adapter
don't lose that and let more chords
oh wait that's the pen charger
this is a pen charger
hurry up this is the pen stand and nin remover
it has instructions on the bottom
it comes with four screws
I don't need to look at the screw
I'm recording with one hand
this is kind of hard open it
you're so handy with tools aren't you anyway
go into the tablet and the three on the left
I'll show you in a second see
I call a power adapter
and then lastly this is the pen charger
it just goes into it
it's pretty easy and it fell through great
I didn't show it when I unboxed it
I first started drawing on this
so you just choose whatever one applies to you
paint this speed paint is like the first time
not a pen display tablet
you have to develop like hand-eye coordination which
you can do that on your tablet
I don't know whatever you want
I haven't talked to you guys in a while
it'll be out hopefully this month or early next month
I don't really care I made it for you guys
I'm gonna plug it into my next video
I am stressed but I hope you like this video
I'm sorry and thank you so much for watching
the alcatel one t10 appears to be an excellent option
this tablet was unveiled in last year
october i have been testing it for past few days
and here is my review
the black panel had a slightly textured surface
that could hide fingerprints reasonably well
this is a wi-fi only device and through the slot
we can expand the memory up to 128 gigs moving
grilles this is a 10 inch ips
i realize it's not the brightest screen in the bunch
another thing i didn't like about this
one is the brightness of the screen
the degree of the detail is appropriate
this tablet is powered by mediatex
you should also realize that
this tablet is not built for heavy games
as far as consistency is concerned
this hybrid tablet is powered by 4080mah battery
which you might feel is too little
thanks to alcatel for providing a keyboard along with this
smart tablet is your choice
the current price will be updated in the description
so just check that out with that
we have come to the end of this video
this is the Samsung Galaxy
Super AMOLED screen and in this video
we'll be doing a full in-depth review
Ranjit and I have been using the Samsung Galaxy
it works pretty well the UI is the Samsung magazine
screen sportings a resolution of 2,560
hundred pixels the tablet has three gigs of ram hence
s moving to the other browser for example
the staff s 10.5 is powered by
how vibrant they look on this tab
this is an ideal solution
it just weighs 467 grams
so what do I think about this Samsung Galaxy
I noticed some cons with the stylus
I don't feel that they're very loud
the speaker should have been front firing
because even at max volume
have a look at this
Samsung Galaxy Tab s 10.5
I'll appreciate if you can click the like button
hello everyone this is - today
I have a drawing tablet review for you
this is the week 15
it's a 10 by 6 inch drawing tablet
let me just this side
this is the stand for the pen
you have the pen and the pen case
and what's this underneath the box
I'm just taking everything out first
we have this wheel and in the middle
there is a button design of the tablet
it's very simple and clean
we have four small rubber feet
it's nice to touch and build quality
I like the rounded corners
it looks very slick alright
let's connect this to my computer and test it out
so let's see what we can do with the driver
Windows ink on or off
I have already set the usual shortcuts that are used
so he can assign mouse clicks
this is the pen eraser toggle
this is the dahle function switch
I may reduce the brush
I see some jitter pressure jitter all right now
let me try and draw slow lines
I'm not going to draw anything complicated for this review
let me try the scroll wheel
sixty dollars and a 15 non-pro it's us 56 dollars
they seem to come out just the way
they also respond to pressure
well let's try to slow lines again
I don't see any jitter
Krita now notice the shape of the cursor
this is also very responsive
it's very responsive and pressure
I expect them to so
Mac OS so this is clip studio paint now
I discovered a few issues with Mac OS driver
so the first issue is the function switch
I've actually assigned here so I click
it changed to changing the brush
it doesn't work so by default
alright to conclude if you are a Windows user
this is a drunk tablet
I can recommend very easily for us
it has a lot of shortcut buttons
they work really well so no issues with
alright so thanks for watching
if not see you guys in the next video bye
The Huion HS64 is a mini drawing tablet
like you would expect, but you can also use on
This doesn’t work on iPhones or iPads.
Wireless pen with 2 shortcut buttons.
It won’t work below that.
Next, plug the cord into the tablet.
Then plug the cable into your device.
Just plug it in and play.
Those only work on computers.
Pressure sensitivity does work. The HS64 also works with computers.
you need to install a driver.
Install. Plug your tablet in.
Ok, now you can change settings.
Set your shortcut buttons at the top.
In the second tab, set the pen’s shortcut buttons.
Use the righthand slider to change
how sensitive the pen pressure is.
Game Mode is good for playing games like OSU.
You may also reset to default here.
What do I think of this tablet?
Well, I’m amazed something so small works so well.
Unlike drawing tablets that have screens, with a screenless tablet
And for $35, that’s a steal.
You really do need a phone
my phone didn’t fall off the slippery book tower.
On the computer side, I have no criticisms.
Everything about drawing felt smooth and natural.
that's a speculation of this video
Samsung just released their newest mid tier model the Tab
welcome everyone to another review going over
it's a very minor difference being a little over
I couldn't hold it with one hand now
on the back there's no faux leather
it doesn't feel like that seamless piece of glass
that would go all the way to the edge
starting with the right offers very clicky and good feedback
power and volume buttons graciously a micro
now going on to the very bottom is a micro
units probably equivalent to my samsung note
it's not too loud but with movies
it's not strong in the bass
our photos right from the tablet itself
now just like most if not all
you can run it perfectly
fine i got'em it because of its low
ram count a 1.5 on android
just really doesn't cut it from moderate users
if you have a few tabs in a web-browser
that's more of a ramp issue
Flipboard where you can see all of your news
sources and magazines that you accumulate
Samsung has dropped a magazine
I'm shocked as far as we're into technology today
it's a to be answered
you starting to show and being fair it works
it's good for a light to generic use here
it's the same price basically as the Tab
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
so i'd seen something recently
this is the 10 inch dragon touch android tablet
you simply put and prod your tablet or mobile phone
touch tablet works really well together
game glass maps the controls
the dragon touch tablet and game
well together i'm really enjoying the combination
it's quite a chunky tablet
but round the side you've got the volume rockers
it's very good for multimedia
and check out the interface as quite often
these low-cost tablets can suffer from slightly sluggish interface
but you can see here
it's really nice and smooth
it's responsive this game uses motion controls
the sound quality isn't brilliant
the speakers are on the top
google docs and found this worked very well
it handles all basic tasks
really well i highly recommend game class
it has a range of usage
the tablet was on a really cool stand
so let's get started with the video
the colors are surprisingly good but lack
the deeper blacks found on more expensive tabs overall
the performance is quite impressive for a sub 100 tablet
the key features are display the 8 inch
sound for watching movies and listening to music
this is our best budget tablet for families
bezels giving you a higher screen to display ratio overall
atmos is ideal for families to watch videos movies
parental controls than what the fire hd offers
protection helps to reduce the risk of eye strain
the third product on our list is the samsung galaxy
tab a this is our best value budget tablet
stay tuned for the samsung galaxy
this is our best budget ipad
draw sketch or paint making it
this is our best overall budget tablet
lite may be a great option for you
aren't bad giving you a more cinematic audio experience
expandable storage doubles the galaxy tab
lets you easily write notes
lite brings a lot to the table
and that's all for this video
hello everyone in this video
I'm going to be unboxing
and reviewing the human dwh 6:9 tablet
so let's get unboxing so here in the Box
it's like a carrying case dancing
it is very nice and it's very thin and light
it is not heavy at all next in the Box
I've never actually had one of these
I've always wanted one of these though
it's very nice so over here
the pen does need to be charged
so as you review what you get in
the box is the tablet
I was super happy about
it has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity and
I had it on the wired
setting um so for the wireless
with how easy the wireless was to set up
I was expecting it to be really complicated overall
I thought the wireless worked very well
the pen does not require any battery or charging so
I did find this to be interesting so at first
it has a six hundred hour battery life so
I don't think you'll have to worry about it
so the price of the huion tablet is $100
this is a very reasonable price
the tablets are usually about 200 dollars
so this ends my review of huion dw8 69
hi guys this is yi from dove
you've got a 1600 by 1200 resolution which is ok
connector at the bottom this particular model has nano
you've got the power and on off at the front
you've got a 2 megapixel camera at the back
we've got a trial version of coal painter
the full app costs three pound 89 from the
HP have included this HP notes app
which gives you two options so from here
what you're actually writing on the piece of paper which
let's just change that for a little bit
this is the view of HP Pro 12
so it's on the pen mode and then from there
we align the tablet and it's a bit tricky
you have to make sure you line
I'm writing from the paper to the screen
then it's pretty good so thanks for watching
I hope you enjoyed it
hope to see you soon
it's as sleek as a tablet can get these days
oh and it's waterproof the Xperia z4 tablet is gorgeous
around the screen are now slimmer
aesthetic is quite close to what you have on stock
Android it still feels unmistakably sunny
thanks to the proprietary widgets
I like Samsung's tablets though
Snapdragon chipset on tap the Xperia
z4 tablet is very fast our benchmarks show great
LTE version standby is impressive to the eight point
one megapixel camera produces great images photos
come out nice and sharp with spot-on colors
well this one hardly has a match out there
hey everybody a flaw inside but in the folks in
it's got a really nice
the performance is a little bit lacking
this is a non gaming tablet
there wasn't much else on here
you do have a headset
adapter here at the top on the back
I took out in my garden
it's a really nice browsing experience overall
I am running the Chrome browser right
they're very decent as far as its frame rates concerns
it's really going to lag quite a bit
so this one has it again
the nice 10 inch display very high resolution
the battery is really good on here
who's just looking to read some stuff do some email
oh boy I sure do love this
Courtney uh who are you
it's me Hawaiian Oh huion you look so different
I know I did you wrong
please give me one more chance
you can blame it all on me
I'll give you one more chance
so here's a funny story you know
how in the last tablet review
yes who contacted me that's right
Hugh Leon it's like they knew I was betraying them
let's crack open this tablet
let's see what's under the hood ok
I'm already seeing some pros and cons pros
I see one major major con here
he doesn't come with a stand
which is not very good for your posture
I even drawn a super form for S&T since 2009
so it's about high time
I do a redesign for it for a reference
this is what our super form looked like back then
I even made a fancy pantsy transformation video for it
just for a teeny bit of inspiration
it'd be madness also right before
I pointed her ponytail and bangs upward to further
get that effect for her clothes
I basically wanted to do her
this would be the next step up
I changed the gloves into these sort of half gloves
I was half inspired by my drawing gloves
I gave her skirt a belt because I felt like
that'd be a nice little upgrade
that's basically it for the sketch
like she was in a super form and when
I actually did a lot more to this
so here's the final product
I really love how this design turned out
this is actually a really nice tablet
it has a smooth surface
I got the hit detection lined up
it felt a lot more accurate than the
this tablet is pretty small and perfect for beginners
and the next one is the tablet itself
this is a really good start
so that whenever you're working the tablet won't slip off
i'm not really used to drawing with my phone
enjoy the speed paint first
i told you that's a monster ago
but guess you couldn't count
i'm here for you you know
even if i'm not around you can wake me up
i will drive my kids to make you feel alright
i know what you deserve when no one showed you
love will someday come around with foreign so okay
so my thoughts about this tablet
i am actually amazed at the performance of this product
please read the description for more details
and that's it for this video
bye the cable where you're supposed to con
how do i say it cable
why did i say phone instead of a tablet
the pressure sensitivity was working
i mean the pen is pretty responsive sage
i definitely recommend it rivery you
hi everyone this is teal from pocket box comm today
I'm going to review the who
we all sent this to me a few weeks ago
I've been trying this off for a few weeks today
I'm going to talk about it
this is the packaging box
I have already taken out the tablet rice
do you want to show it to you
so they have this cushion to protect the tablet
that is supposed to be inside
this is a thank you card
these are the boxes that hold accessories inside this box
so this is the tablet when
I first took it out of the box
I was really impressed by the you
quality disk feels very sturdy
the finishing is very nice
it has these max of is finishing
the corners are rounded all the look and feel of
this is the power switch to use it
there are six physical shortcut buttons depress
the tactile feel of all these buttons are quite good
the feeling of the trackpad is good as well
the size of the trackpad is
I would say quite good
they were not there when
I took these out of the box
so this tablet you can attract some blemishes and
I'm not sure you can see the fingerprints
I'll talk more about that later on now
this is a nice looking case or well-built very sturdy
it supports 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity
it's rather long and it has a tapered end here
there are two buttons here
it's battery-powered so you do need to charge it
there are eight replacement nibs
it's a very small receiver
make sure you do not lose this
this is the charging cable for the pen
I don't think that's going to be a problem
if it runs all battery just charge it
I'm now using the tablet in Wireless mode
this is where we can change their shortcut buttons
you can map the whole tablet to the whole screen
the tablet is using a 16 by 9 aspect ratio
there could be some issues
Photoshop cs5 on the Mac
let me create a new file
the straighter looks let me switch over to using
this is a drawing app
pressure works is very smooth
there is no lack lines
there are no what you turn in fact
I think this performs even better compared to Photoshop
Pro so it works very well with MIDI Bank King
Pro pressure works no lack
all right here is where
I have created a new flower in MIDI Bank
so let me try that
it doesn't seem to recognize what I'm trying to do
so this is quite frustrating
it just does not work
let me try rotating anti-clockwise
but not so with this
it seems that our just does not work
mischief mischief should be able to rotate
so let me draw the letter
A again and try it with mischief
I'm now going to switch over to using Crete R
this is basic tip default size ability
I'm not sure if it's supposed to behave like this
the pressure works anyway so it somehow works in
Crete R or not work
I'm not too sure so
these are the apps that
I've tested today on my Mac
let me open my tax review to see if
that wasn't this problem but now there is this problem
our affinity photo and designer
I'm going to try to use
nothing comes out now with illustrator cs5 and CC
I think illustrator cs5 it works fine but with illustrator
it will always drag my buttons around when in fact
let me summarize for you
the build quality is excellent
the wireless capability is very useful
the trackpad is close to being useless
and today you see in some of my demonstration
that's all for today's review
I hope this review is helpful
thanks for watching see you in the video I you
hi guys welcome back today
i have a really good tablet
currently i've just checked on amazon.com uk
you're getting a tablet with
i don't understand why they've mixed the colors
rocker seems to be a microphone
we have a sim tray and a headphone socket
i actually asked myself when i got this
i played some games on it
i got around about four hours
i haven't actually tried it as a phone
i don't know how that would actually work
the tablet does come with two cameras
here's a photo on the back
it is a very very good tablet and something
i think you should consider
if you're looking for one
it's got a headphone jack
as well there which is great
i would definitely definitely recommend this one
see you in the next one bye you
We're finally checking out the remarkable tablet
I wanted to review a combination of things today
the design the hardware the software and
But without further ado folks.
Let's dive into today's video
So that's a really important thing.
It is very thin as you can see
Is it the top and the bottom
you have this like rubber that helps for example?
And that's a really small detail
keeping it in a portfolio that they offer with it
Maybe that's cuz I got the white edition.
It doesn't happen in the black one
There were three buttons at the bottom in the middle
What's really nice is when you're using it.
I don't know whether you can hear that
Now something I'd say is the battery
life is pretty reasonable on this device
And naturally that's when the Battery depletes faster
It does charge up in one hour.
So that's a pretty reasonable recharge time
This is the pen that comes along with it.
I don't know the word for it
and it's also this signature one now they both
It does allow you to write pretty well on it.
They give you some cartridges for free.
I don't think they get worn down as fast.
I've probably only changed my once in two months
And it's helpful for annotating but nothing major
It's again something that you'll find that you may use
You can create notes now
The good thing is one thing I was impressed with
is they have things called templates?
You can have dotted notes
So it is a very handy canvas
Now there is something called Live View.
Now there are some abilities for sketches
where you can edit the layers, for example
So I created this sort of new structure
You can set it to flight mode
Which allow you to get started
I'm gonna say I like it
I'm gonna say I like it
I've never really had a Tablet.
So for me, this is like a really nice experience
I like journaling on paper
I think I really like it about
they're the things that sort of the cons
Then that might ruin the natural offline aspects of it
I don't think it's very well-priced.
I think it's designed for more of a premium market
It's to help you get away from that environment
Flowing it doesn't necessarily I notice like even backers noting.
They're like, it's okay to use this
how good is it in terms of the sketching abilities?
beforehand is definitely more accurate
This is actually the first edition
There are now two two editions as of this video
Apple depending on what you go with
separately, which means you then add up to 550
So the signature pen is definitely nice
But my opinion is I really like this device.
I'm continuing to use it as you can imagine
its taking me away from the screen
It's also giving me a paper like experience
But then I've never had an iPad
just take note into that
You're probably just saying pick up some paper
Francesca because it would be a lot cheaper
I'm looking to get an iPad soon
I'm also gonna look to get the remarkable 2 tablet
I will be doing more videos about this
I'm very impressed with this
and if you have one
Thank you so much for stopping by.
i poise or any other in the circle
the tablet comes in nice with simplistic box
now let's get into a technical side of things
this does make quite a big difference for me
i as a former mouse player instantly felt more comfortable
LPI which means lines per inch
the reading height of the tablet is around 1.5 centimeters
I feel that it makes my a more stable
I guess the pen uses two one AAA battery
which as I've said it's not included
suddenly the pen itself feels really good
and you could call it premium
two of them are on the side of the pen
I'll talk more about that in the driver
I think it's pretty cool design
it's like a real pen
I'll just play it up here one thing
whenever you push on it
I really do love how it looks like
I found a bit irritating as a dragon player
is the light every time depend
a green light is turned on is
I noticed the first time might use the tablet
I compared to two other tablets
unfortunately it's not much to hang in a Christmas tree
I have had problems with it
there is no good way to do this unfortunately hopefully
Shion will release an update this somewhere in the future
I think this tablet can be the right choice
thanks for watching this review
i have to think of something anime
alright i guess it's time for a new intro
shout out to my boy
wonderflunky he streams by the way follow him on twitch
this is the pd 2200 tablet
it's pretty hot like look look at this
look at the box it came in
we gotta get into the specs
no extra wires and a super light pen
we really living in the future here
guess it'll just take a little getting used to
would i recommend this tablet
hell yeah for this price point
the tablet is so worth it
i'm actually planning to give away the tablet
anyway that's the end of the tablet review
here's the finished product and our new intro
i'm andrea for my next table
you can buy right now
is the Apple iPad Mini 5
that was released in 2019
so this is a very sharp screen
you can buy right now
I was in 15 minutes for this test
below the screen is the touch
you can connect a mouse by now
you can buy right now
oh it sadly there's no premium
you can buy right now
and it does have many premium features for instance
inside the media pad m58
runs a queueing 960 processor
one time was 11 hours
there's no pen support though it
does everything up in scanner which sits underneath the screen
the immediate pad m58 is running
Android 8 yes is that it's a bit older
I don't forget any major updates anymore and the media
I'm not sure how secure that is
you can buy right now but again
it does promise an 8.4
it supports all these standard
8 tablets are getting 2 updates but
which is a mid-range 8 inch tablet
we're getting a mostly metal body here
I mentioned if those are not available in your country
Lenovo tab m8 which I really enjoyed
it heavily performed very well with 20 3.5 hours
it is running a car comes
the certainly is not a gaming tablet
the big quality is ok
it is running and what 9 including one
I'm not speaking for Samsung
Amazon doesn't say what it is it is OK
you can't open two apps side by side
you can install them yourself
I'm Andrea for my next table
comm thanks for watching and see you next time
so look who got a package in the mail today
hello everyone my name is
the report rate is 265
open ooh almost there not very experienced with bosses
whoa and here is a tablet
this is honestly the biggest tablet
I have ever see if I can get it out
I just have like really small tablets
yeah that's got like this nice cloth bag
I really do like it
it's got the keys on the side so
let me just get this off first
you couldn't stick it here and then pull out
I like this really liking these designs
so far let's see what else is in the package
I'll be back in a second
let's see this glove again
oh and it's got a pretty design on it too
I personally don't use these clothes
I'm not sure what this is for
oh maybe for cleaning the toilet
Oh read about it in a minute
it's a it's a cool design
you can click stuff on here again
I think that's about it
it's honestly pretty crazy so anyways today
I'll be reviewing part was a 6/10 plus drawing tablet
I found that the tablet was honestly really amazing
I mean I was initially shocked by
how could the pressure was which is really saying something
I'll admit that I found that
it's just so nice and smooth honestly
I wanted to talk about the pressure
the pressure is absolutely astounding
in fact it was so good
it is 100% worth it
the size is pretty damn good for $70
I've seen much smaller town
it's honestly really cool to actually feel like
and don't get me wrong
all these hotkeys being 100% customizable to your liking
a pen with 9 amps
I also really loved the packaging
I know I said it before
but it's worth mentioning again
the packaging was so good and safe
I honestly didn't find anything major
the most annoying thing about the tablet is whenever
I touched the pen to any sort of surface
I hear a little cooking sound
I really really didn't like something
this isn't an issue for me at all
I was struggling to find any cons at all
I mean I find it so surprising
I'm going to say despite all the hate she gets
isn't how ridiculous it was that she could even blame
in fact the truth is she never really blamed
Jay feather she always blamed herself all right
maybe she did actually make herself believe it was
that led your brother to his untimely death
you would feel absolutely horrendous
tail killed rather than herself
most of the time your mind will do this subconsciously
in order to ease your anxieties
so she's not entirely at fault here in my opinion
and that japheth are inflamed
he'll are likely having some quarrels
this leading to flame tails murder
I believe this showing how torn apart
if everyone else believes it
it's also none of that
the quality is absolutely amazing
I really got hope you guys enjoy the video
it was a lot of fun to make
I'll see you all next time
how far does this think ahead and will this
carve a new niche for a declining tablet market
the n1 is an aluminum
the back surface is smooth
look and it makes it very pleasing to hold
I found that the colors are extremely accurate
I've seen for most cases 324
one thing that I found
is that if you put any pressure on the display
you'll notice some color bleeding
beefy specs are only half the story with this device
there's a lot of action on the screen
it does slow down a little bit well
this tablet had no slowdown issues
another example is a game like fruit ninja
play this game out of android tablets
this is one of the best performing ones
battery life for standby was impressive
the n1 tablet is Android 5.0.1 lollipop
C launcher is a simple launcher
that only consists of two screens
neither so you can type in
there is something to know about this launcher
that is still in beta
it's still running a pretty much stock version of
which lets you tweak to z launcher a bit more
the front-facing camera provides you with the same story
I got to be honest here
the tablet is great in high quality and premium
but the camera is just lacking
I don't walk around taking pictures with my tablet
it ran fine now as far as hardware
it ran all the applications without an issue z
so if you don't like the Z
launcher you can throw on any third-party launcher that
I will have no problems
you know to do if you like this video
i'm kevin the tech ninja
let's get started xp pen
released deco mini 7 last hour
and this is mini 7w
it's the wireless version of that model
but this is wireless deco
01 version 2 is about 70 us dollars
this is about 60 us
this video is not sponsored
the tablet comes in this box
and here's the mini 7 wireless graphics tablet
it's good and it has a matte surface
my favorite there are eight custom
build buttons on the tablet
here this is the back side with four rubber feet
it's a new generation xp pen stylus
of course it's a battery free stylus
this is the usb-c cable
it's a really good quality
cable guys i like it

Tom passed how inappropriate content for certain age
so they with that turn it on
let me get out of here first
you can change your password
that password is to change the parent password
you tell your stories you tell you your your lock
it was just safe into your Google account
I like that they're using this
I mean the normal apps that is in store here
you go radio your Google map to show them
where's the map you know
I can take pictures here
I did put on Chrome ok right
I forgot to set press
Google they have this quill junior calm
yes just bear with it.
well in a new or at least new for me
let's first see what all you get in the package.
the box art is nice and subtle and that game
like all the premium stuff from huion
the box quality is excellent
you get a battery free pen
that's what they are claiming.
you also get a pen
you also get a manual
the packaging will look like a cd
but it's not a cd.
the inclusion of an extendable cable is smart.
the hdmi port is for the display signal
is there in case the earlier
this time in the box
and that's also what the manual said.
and because the size of this tablet is 13 inches
it will not ask for much power draw anyway.
compared to other bigger display tablets out there.
your phone's charges to give sufficient power to the tablet.
the ipad pros are only 5.9
hd 13 inches with a 120 srgb color gamut.
and because of the size it feels super compact
the screen has a super matte
right after i installed the driver software as admin
mwhich was kind of odd.
and by stuff i mean art.
the lines in pressure felt perfect
like the recent huion products i tested and working on
this was a true joy
there is an almost very minor parallax on the screen
thin lg has made extremely slim tv panels
so let's see till when companies like huion etc acquired
that tech for their display tablets.
even working on zbrush was actually pleasurable.
this might cause an issue.
especially if your eyes for colors are extremely peculiar.
that's just not practical and healthy.
i've tried and used in the past now
it's quite heavier than ipad or a surface pro
you can't really get those.
and for a healthy upright setting posture too.
so anyway make sure to get other
third party stands available on aliexpress or amazon
another good worthy product by huion.
MuBot out. That was a long freaking video man.
how long is it. is it longer than the hobbit.
what is going on guys
this is a 7-inch tablet runs
so let's put this off to the side
there's something to keep in mind when you get this
I don't know I never look at these things
no buttons at the top
what game better to check out
that's a not too crazy than subway surfers
so let's get that loaded up
I don't think so no
I never play this game though
this should work great with that kind of stuff
maybe you're into consuming media
you can see got my video playing
let me put the volume up
good very impressed with the videos with a look
it is only one speaker on the back here
you're not gonna get stereo speakers but like
I said it doesn't sound that bad
Plus this does that great as well open up
they plays fine loads up fairly fast as well
and let's go back here and you can check out
I took with the front-facing camera
it didn't call it that bad at all
especially you know for a tablet
I took with the back camera
do you know pretty much fine with it
I have my home button
just you can see the performance of this
the fire tablet the this that this actually runs
it's nice you know the performance isn't that bad
the speaker isn't that bad battery
you know pretty much anything that you want on it
let me load up a website real quick here so
I'll load up my Greg
see you guys down the road boots
this is the canvas 22 studio
is that a couple of weeks ago
of course like i said
so i've tested a number of different painting softwares
and then we'll check out the actual tablet capabilities
how good does it feel to draw on this thing
looks uh i'm not gonna lie
it looks a little bit flimsy
so it's not a plastic film
it's an actual glass surface
which is very very nice
it's the same as the wacom cintiqs in that
it's definitely not a portable device
this is a desktop device
i won't be traveling with this
you have a brand new computer pen display tablet technology
and so i'm sure for most of you
this won't mean much but here we can see that
the cpu is a core i5 8400
all went away as soon as it was updated
yeah here just looking at the temperatures stays pretty stable
that is quite demanding but it was never that bad
that would bother me it
yeah when it comes to the device itself
the speakers are really really bad
this is a 22 inch tablet
it's only full hd so 1080p
at least i didn't uh didn't calibrate anything
it seemed good enough to me now
brush strokes are nice and smooth
everything was working as it should
we have in total like 20 different
you can set it to whatever you want
the drivers will completely crash
drivers without having to reboot your entire machine
maybe in a future update huion
well what happens if you want a different
that's a little bit better
that's nice the fact that it's a standalone machine
is this a good purchase
that can barely play solitaire in that case
display tablet for the entry level
we're looking at around 1200 us dollars
so this is the version with eight
gigs of ram and 120 gigs
essentially is a mini computer
that costs 950 bucks with keyboard and mouse included
hell yeah that's probably what i would do
the canvas studio 22 is all about convenience
well i had a really hard time finding something
is that big of a deal and the drawing part
i'll see you next foreign
hey everyone in today's video
this is priced at us $29.99
so this is less than us
$30 this is the tablet
tablet design is pretty straightforward
I like the rounded corners
Wacom Intuos step was released
there are 4 shotgun buttons
these are sleep your cases for the pen
this is a pretty tight fit for the pen
the dry surface is pretty smooth
this is a braided cable
so on one end this
the big logo is behind and the design
there is no driver this included
so you have to download the driver from their website
YJ driver so let's take a look at the features
switch here you can test the pressure sensitivity
there's no way for you to enter your own keys
I'm using a 27-inch monitor
this tablet is considered small for this monitor generally speaking
you're going to get a very long line
it's really very sensitive and there is no lag
it's very responsive the drawing surface
it's quite nice to work with
it has like texture to it
that's not because of the tablet
it's my computer for the show
physical shocker buttons on the tablet
I have no problems creating dots
looks pretty smooth to me
Photoshop and it works pretty well
I did not notice any issues with this
this is me teabag paint
Pro for some reason the brush
this is creat our and pressure books
works really well so the only problem
I have with this tablet is with MIDI Bank paint
is this if you have more budget
alright so thanks for watching this video
I hope this is helpful
see you in the next one bye
hey guys it's shad and today
I'm gonna be reviewing a 8.5 inch LCD writing tablet
let's go ahead and start the video
those are all the buttons on it
it's very thin this board
what clears out the whole board
I'm saving it is by taking a photo
it is actually really easy to write with this device
it's not even that hard
but it's actually really good if you think about it
h-e-b doulas how are you doing well
Wacom is Wacom not wake up
Computers the circle of life of computers
they have sent me an interest
we have the box which is in this lovely
ooh kind of soft vinyl finish
so let us see what we have
I should think let's see what else we got
we have got actually gentle with this
we got a rocker switch
now cross the top here
there can be multiple keystrokes any command on your computer
I'll show you that in a moment
it stopped flashing at me
now plug it in it says go to
wizard appear so it says pen buttons
so that's the back button
I'm hovering over to right-click
Wacom ID to start the process
use it for my job
select your free bundle software
I can't feel any difference in that at all
have you know stroke modify
what does that come up with keys
let's just keep it there for the moment
I find really quite tricky
so let's go back to pen mode
I feel a lot happier in pen mode
I have no idea what that is about
take your option off and here
things are suited particularly to that programs
this is clip studio paint
it's a pretty massive kind of thing
there's an awful lot to learn here
I'm not really a digital artist
let's draw with a pen
what have we got crayon chalks
let's try something a bit bit bigger
I'm not really quite sure
we got kind of spray cans
what have we got on this thing
that's the kind of different patterns
this is free and this is not amateur at all
this is really quite amazing
I've no idea what these things are for timeline
I presume over here just like Photoshop
you can have so much fun now
I discovered something really really cool about them now
why would you need to spare nibs well
you've got spendings in there
Wacom thing across the top
I've worked out what that is for
they haven't paid me to make this video but can
I only use a Wacom pen
Wacom pen when I used a mouse
we've got applications that are sort of desktop style
it has a magnetic docking mechanism
Acer also has a 10-inch model
this is the 11 inch model
that has a more powerful processor
this version was loaned to me
and again it runs the full windows desktop style
I think you know it's a
I think it's a little bit of a tougher
which is what you tend to find in the cheaper
there's no webcam reset button
microphone my credit card slot micro
the tablet itself has 128 gigabyte solid
that's good open something up here
it's it's not my favorite touch pad
that's sort of your default
this is if you didn't even do that
everything gets really tiny and hard to read
you might not necessarily need to do that but while
I do like the option of being able to say
put two windows side-by-side and a web browser
I'd rather be able to read the text
that's in both of those windows then
have everything looked too tiny
I mean they're at their tablet speakers
it's not my favorite two-in-one device
this is the h 610
yeah there's pressure sensitivity about 8000 levels of it
yeah it even has tilt functionality
we'll see more on that in a minute
I think through a lot of you
there is a price to pay for that often times
this is a pretty cool thing
so let's take a look at this thing
I've done over on my website
I don't remember how Goldilocks ends
it's really light and thin but also sturdy
it's made of plastic and it's the type of plastic
you would expect in a fairly inexpensive device like this
some people collect action figures
the build is good enough
it doesn't feel premium but it doesn't feel bad either
we do have some customizable shortcut keys
it's calibrated pretty well too
what the heck is a soft keys screamed
grandpa bear while destroying a rocking chair
their tap opal shortcut keys
and they're customizable just like the other shortcut keys
just to see how they work there
it's a little bit textured
won't that texture wear out my pen
at a good rate it holds that pressure
well around curves drawing slow angle
Windows or on a Mac
let's talk about that in the box
you don't need any extra software
you don't need any apps it just works
I was pretty impressed with how well this works
I didn't come into any conflicts
it's a cheaper smaller version of this tablet
without as many bells and whistles
going with the lower-priced tablet all right now
I was wondering since this works on Android
I wonder if have a Chromebook sitting around here somewhere
I have to talk to you again beep
I guess and the parents asked me
hey my kids interested in art
Chromebooks just aren't meant for that anyway
I plug this in and it kind of works again
there is one major caveat
I don't think this is gonna work for you
that is a big feature of a drawing tablet
let me know down below in the comment section
thank you guys for watching
I'll see you in a couple of days
i think this deserves some attention
well i know like such uh lcd
it can be used by kids to practice
you can practice your line
work your circles perspective concepts you get the idea
i don't think we need that
and we have the tablet itself over here
yes this is the lock and unlock button
i think it's quite good
that's right for 900 rupees
the lines are nice and thin
i don't think you can see that in the camera
they can practice their equations
i would say right you can practice your line work
i would say i think this feels really good
this is a handy feature
i would say i've just unlocked it now
they say that the battery which is inserted over here
i think it's two of the coin batteries
they say it lasts two years
i don't think the battery should last that long though
this is a good feature
this is a good addition
oops i don't think that is nice
you can take out your ruler
yeah and one more thing
there is a nice slot over here
i wish this had the stylus
so yeah i think that's it for this video
thank you so much for watching and see you bye
hey guys for the past two months
I'm very impressed with the quality of the product
so here is the specs of the tablet
I'm using the first feature
I can say it's very simple and clean
I'm using the tablet and it's very smooth
hand-drawn these sketches with the pencil
I didn't have any problem with it
that cure is a good
it is my first time using it and still
and it's really good so in terms of performance wise
I don't feel any issue with it
I want to discuss over here
this is a spacebar so
which you can customize so practically right now
I'm using this this and these
I kept it like that and under work area
so this is the default option
I you can draw light lines
I received this tablet around here
so everything you see from here owns
I have used the tablet to create this
it has increased my speed and workflow
so here's a my latest editing file where
so it's just my opinion
so if you're big in there
you can do any work of this
I would like to have is the wireless support
it will make this tablet a perfect graphic tablet
see you in the next video
thank you so much for sending it to me
they're very sturdy thick secure boxes
you can tell it was safely packaged
I thought was really cool
we're kind of on top of each other
it is $119.99 u.s. dollars
which is really really great
it's very responsive it has 233
compared to other tablet pens of youth
it's about the same weight
it's not too heavy not too light
they give you whatever function you want
extractors built into the stand
it'll never fall out so
my computer is just like a regular laptop
I really like that kind of texture
I don't like the glossy texture
I feel like the paper
texture gives it good resistance
I'm more used to using a display tablet
the tablet itself has like rounded edges
I got but I thought that was kind of interesting
with a tablet that's only 119
I have no problems connecting it to my computer
brands have never tried too young before so
I'm really happy that I got this opportunity
I hope that you found this interesting
you're watching our hands-on review of the dragon touch k10
so what specs you get for just $100 tablet
I think it will suffice
now here's a quick user manual
seems like there is a pre-applied screen protector
let's just peel off the
headphone jack a dedicated volume rocker
you can see there's no bloatware at all
I think part of the reason is because of that
what's also kind of neat
it's actually a pretty good size in my testing
next pausing things there takeaway is the speakers
I would say for watching some quick YouTube videos
I can also do multitasking
it's actually doing a really good job
it is running on android oreo 8.1
I would say that the quality has definitely improved significantly
you want something that is more stock
go for under a hundred bucks
Q @os reviews that's been the dragon touch K 10
hello everyone in this video
I'll be reviewing this Samsung tablet
it's a Samsung Galaxy Tab
Android tablet now this tablet
it's a decent mid-range tablet
is you can see that
he's very quiet slim as well
the logos at the top
you got the back button and the home button
okay on the right side he has
he has the volume up and down button
and the power button okay
I'm just gonna switch it on so you can see
that's how he switches on on the left side
there's nothing there at the bottom
that's how the tablet looks
okay so let me show you some few things
so wall of about this tablet is that is slim
you got a big screen easy to use
you can see that you know
we go a lot of features
he's so one thing is that you got a 10.1
we were resolution of 1920
two millimeters fin the way is 525
MJ we've to give them
T delay how about battery life etc
okay and the security is you see here
these are the security things here
I go those have information like the connection
the sound their notification the display their wallpaper etc
okay so you got quite of good features boo in
I like about this tablet
well the main figure that the screen is perfect
okay please do give a like and subscribe
hey guys in today's video
I could find that was pretty comparable to this
Wacom tablets that are newer and they're way more expensive
I'm 100% sure they're amazing quality
I was thinking that display tablets are really cool
it has eight Express keys in order
I don't use the expressed keys on tablets
it's kind of hard for me to use those
I used them for about half of the drawing then
it just went by faster for me
just boy tablet and so one thing
tablet and any display tablet
I think in general is make
just because when the tablet arrived for me
I really have no complaints for this tablet
that is worth checking out
I will talk to you guys in my next video
hey guys what's going on so today
uh and let me tell you
it was kindly provided to me by
is this nice white box containing your inspiration
a look at the back
we can see the specifications
USB this time around so here's to the Hat
that's right underneath it like
I I had to take a minute
they're the most up-to-date and the most helpful
it's a simple and clean design
I like it up next
oh my god this is lighter than I was expecting
it has a very nice design and grip to it
it feels like a real pen which
it is lighter than the
Wacom pen as I said so
keep that in mind next
let's get into the drivers okay
I'm using version number fourteen point
so the press keys again
you can bind it to whatever you want
this won't really be important to you next
I think you also have a pressure test again
it's fairly simple easy to use
you do need to push the apply button
but that's pretty much to be expected okay
now that we have the drivers out of the way
let's get into the fun business
let's get into game play now onto my impressions
I guess it's a good tablet
I'm 93 K and when I started using the tablet
you really won't have any problems with this
the drivers were extremely easy to set up
transferring my play area from my
Wakeham 480 to this was almost seamless
I was actually really surprised
I haven't noticed really any input like I mean
you won't have any problem with this
there was going from the 480 to this
I really can't recommend this enough as a first tablet
I don't really know if I can recommend it
this tablet will be perfect for them
so take advantage of it while you can
daddy ooh woo a Rex on Jack
Rhine cinema look hanker code named Alex
Bub's new face and larceny
we're having movie night this Sunday
this was a lot of fun to make
I hope you enjoyed the video
Razer edge is an ambitious product
anyway the edge comes in a few configurations
SSD is sure to fill up fast
it maintained a steady 30 frames per second
I tested the edge with battlefield
naturally gaming has a significant impact on battery life
but it's an ergonomic nightmare
it could be great but it's not quite there yet
are they worth your money
I'm gonna review the home 10.1
I'm used to in premium glass
it's hard to write that
SD card slot for expandable
and let me tell you that little combo right
but you won't want to why not
I'm not even sure what a camera this bad is
it should have been left off
which would have actually lowered the tablet price
megapixel sorry VGA quality front-facing camera essentially
it's a potato from the 1990s
which actually bypasses your ear drum
but you aren't buying this tablet for photos anyway right
you want to browse the web
you might want to play some games
test is always a great way to see
Sky Force reloaded ran surprisingly well on this
I had a hard time stopping and playing
current obsession is not as good
it's pretty jittery at times
and maybe it would be depending on your kid
it's passable though again that Battery depletes so quickly
Vudu library was easy to browse and view
I mentioned earlier the Walmart button
Android Pi installation on this device
Amazon rival the Fire HD 8 and 10 inch tablets
it's that you get stock
there might best sum up my time with the on
Android yes it technically does tablet II things and yes
it's pretty darn inexpensive dare
thanks for watching hands-on tech
hello everyone in today's video
i'm going to review the gaomon
this is a review unit
that garmon has sent over now
the link is in the video description below
so this is a pen tablet drawing tablet
that doesn't have a display
the pen no longer uses any battery
we have the thank you card warranty card
eight replacement nibs are included
and that's the nip remover
two adapters to help you
connect the tablet to your android phone or tablets
it's comfortable to hold with the large rubber grip
so this is the tablet
the design is very simple
it's a very typical drawing tablet design
this is the side profile
there are 16 soft keys
there's this little sleeve for holding the pen
and now let's see what the driver can do
soft keys you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts
you want by typing the keys
these are the various mouse functions
this is midi bank paint pro
this is this is very good performance
it's very accurate and predictable
they work really well personally
this is krita on windows
let's do the test again
this time with the samsung tablet in vertical mode
there is another issue here so this time around
so you won't be able to change
it's excellent with the very strong software
it's really worth the money
it's a very good buy
see you in the next video bye
this is a two-in-one convertible in the first place
there's got the the pin connector in the middle
because this is a critical factor
I'm going to show you in a second here
you don't have to be 100% that's pretty high
ok so together here we have the 2 flex devices
now why are we bringing these together so what
I like the screen resolution
I would say an easier
the screen is the battery
I found the Wi-Fi connection
in this video we're gonna look at the van
Keogh matrix pad z10 10.1 inch Android tablet
they sent me this as a review unit and
I'm really excited to get this thing opened now
let's go ahead and take a look at the box
it actually has a really nice sleek design
so let's go ahead and crack this
open all right so right away in the box
we've got the tablet front and center
the tablet actually looks really nice
this is a third-party tablet
this device comes with 32 gigs onboard
it's not the thinnest tablet
I've ever seen but I've definitely seen much thicker
we have our volume rocker
USB charging port we have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
we also have a mini
HDMI out and we have our microphone
Keogh logo with the basic information
we've got our rear camera
we've also got a really small reset button
I found that the display is actually really really nice
US dollars which is actually a really good price
you actually have two cool features
one of them is called
which is actually really nice
Play Store so there isn't any limitations
everything worked flawlessly and everything rendered nicely
I'm actually really impressed to know
I think we might actually be able to get Dreamcast
we're gonna load another game
I think we'd be okay
I might get a lot of hate for saying that
maybe it's just some crazy nostalgia
it was my first platforming game on the ps1 so
I'm really happy with that
Crash Bandicoot which is a staple
we can see that it also plays really well
I'm not having any latency issues
the quality on screen is good
it's totally capable of playing your favorite PlayStation 1 games
I didn't have any graphical errors
I didn't have any audio issues
there wasn't any graphical issues
I just enjoyed the gameplay
I did try to run
Dreamcast through retroarch and it was an absolute failure
don't think that it's perfect because are some slowdowns that
the game felt really good
it was totally playable and there wasn't any major issues
there was the occasional slowdown from time to time
it ran actually fairly well and it was completely playable
so it's kind of hit or miss
I have Dragon Ball Z
shin boudic ion here and the game ran really well
it's not the most ideal playing scenario
I've got for you for this video again
I just want to thank Van
Keogh for sending out this review unit
I'll talk to you guys again real soon
hey what's going on guys this
ETA prime pack here again today
we're gonna be taking a look at the all new
Amazon Fire HD 8 plus now
the standard version does come in a little cheaper
it's $89.99 for the plus
hey I heard you guys like bezels
CPU and a much more powerful GPU
so if you don't mind spending a little extra cash
I would definitely recommend the Fire
they've kept the headphone jack
our RAM the Plus version and two gigs of RAM
it's a pretty decent display
we do get dual band
there's just not a lot so what
it's gonna work just fine now
Plus it's compatible with the tablet
Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime YouTube
so first up we have 3d mark
so we do have a significantly more powerful
GPU in the bigger tablet stop
we have antutu total score 90 1649
unfortunately this does not run on the older HD 8
we're getting a good framerate
this is fully playable on the new
Fire HD 8 plus and
I still have fancy graphics on
FPS is just fine for a mobile device
so yes these tablets will handle
I'm upscaled here to 800 by 600
I got a few more games to test here
so we were able to upscale
this performance is great where you got a constant 60fps
we have dreamcast using re drain
so in the end with the new 2020
but either way you look at it
the choice is up to you
but that's it for this video really appreciate you watching
I mentioned in this video
hello everyone welcome back to my youtube channel
so today we are reviewing the amazon fire hd 10
this is the 32 gigabyte 1080p with alexa
if you can wait if you cannot wait
it's still worth the price
this is actually the second one that i'm reviewing
i actually gave one to homestead tessie
we got internet and everything linked to this
you got music you got audible newsstand
and it's just a great tablet you know
i highly recommend it for the price you know
i love the first one
alright guys thank you for watching
the tablet definitely gets a 10 out of 10.
i i i can't express enough
sometimes it's a hundred and eighty dollars
i've seen it at two hundred dollars
valentine's day normally around fourth of july
basically they've just got them on these sheets now
they just come like this
just because of how it was packaged
but that's not an issue of the Coburn tablet
I can only be used
I've used in the past when I keep key videos
were stripping the thread on these
I'm not going to worry about that once
Lots sort of extreme tests
I think that his extreme tests actually go way
that's why I'm the review page
it's actually one impressed with the
I think this is a really good value buy
I hope that was helpful
I make that helps people
hello everyone welcome to my channel
Jax and today we'll be unboxing and reviewing the huion
H 640 p graphics drawing tablet
I get asked questions about buying tablets on a budget
they all seem to say
I've never been able to test
its claim out myself since
I've never used their tablets until of course today
let's get to the unboxing
that's awesome a little bats up there
we can download the relevant drivers for the tablet
now here is the tablet itself
it's a lot smaller than ours
I can do a little size comparison as well
okay what else do we have
oh there is the stylist since
I've never actually had to do so
finally we have a connection cord
that's a boy but everything seems to be pretty self-explanatory
I'm just gonna go ahead
I was using in many bang
you can figure it out
I wanted to get into the drawing so here
I'll just be drawing this exact same character of mine
he's just a nice easy
the tablet works pretty much
how it should have worked initially
it was a bit hard gauging
all of those worked perfectly fine
I didn't have any glitches with those
you can definitely see the different levels of pressure sensitivity
you're using by the time
having that was a nice bonus a couple of things
I wanted to mention was that
the stylus doesn't need to be recharged or anything
the tablet comes with inside the pen
they can barely fit anything onto well
its grateful undergo work though
probably not the best for you know
thank you so much for watching this video
subscribe to my channel for more reviews speedpaint
but unlike a lot of tablets
this particular model has a 32 watt hour battery
it's one of the fastest bay trail systems that
work pretty nicely on that full HD display
let's go ahead and close that now
is you can run full desktop applications
dock sells for about 160 dollars
but it gives you a full size
the tablet it's about 1.6 pounds
the keyboards about 1.7 pounds and together
it's it's like a thin enlight notebook with a full
HD display in terms of overall performance
you can find some more detailed benchmark breakdowns
I haven't had problems running
let's go ahead and turn the volume down here
I haven't had problems running multiple out side by side
it's not necessarily as fast as something with saya
Haswell CPU but in terms of benchmarks
CPU intensive tasks like using handbrake to encode videos
I'm having a hard time getting video to play
let's go ahead and let that run in the background
I'll show you you know
lets get an open a picture that we can edit
so it's full screen we can use menus
so let's see what that happens
what happens when we do that in real time here
slow internet connections not making this ideal
let's go ahead and do this
that's a device that doesn't have all the perks
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
make these kind of things
but they'll actually does too clearly
it could actually be interesting
look at it now so clearly
this thing is very beefy
I'll call it 12 inches
it's got a quad core
CPUs you've got two removable batteries on the back
swap them out in the field
a thousand in that's what
we'll talk about how well it actually does there
so it's meant for outdoor use
you can still see it
you can actually probably hurt somebody with this
if you have to do
this thing is pretty darn heavy
the tablet itself weighs about three pounds
it's not the lightest thing
that sort of thing is fine now
it's submerging it in water and going swimming
V Pro for tenth gen yet
SSD anywhere from 128 gigs
onboard performance is just fine
ice-like isn't so super huge
HD resolution and an 11 point 6 inches
it has an anti-glare surface
it looks kind of grainy
this which is still really darn crazy
bright and again it has a polarizer on the screen
it has the weirdest white balance
graph is off the charts bad
so the display on this supports touch
do diagramming all that sort of thing
that's what that's for again
this feels like a regular laptop keyboard
not like you're making any compromises with some flimsy tablet
the one drawback is the trackpad
you can get a charger
that's either barrel pin or USB see
optionally if you want a 90 watt charger
HD resolution power consumption is not too high
you can impact battery life pretty strongly
SSD if you wish to do upgrades on it
it makes it for mobile tech review
hi everyone this is to offer on pocket blocks calm
I've already taken out the tablet
so there's a thank you
Scott and in this box has the stylus pen
I'm going to show them to you one by one
it's a very large tablet
so that's the working circuit error
so this is a very large tablet
the big quality is alright it has very little flex
the buttons are all right
they are easy to press
each button comes with some indentation
let me show you what on this side here
that is the pot for the power cable
these are the two cables that are provided
this is the USB charging cable
let me show you the stylist
this is how the stylist look like
it's mostly made of hard plastic
the grip section is also hot plastic
the surface finishing is met feels quite good in hand
it's lightweight but not too light
I'm not too sure of their battery life
let's take a closer look at it
it retracts a bit into the stylus
took it at an angle
you can just pull up
we just put this back in all right now
is the time for me to test the tablet
let me switch this on first
I've already installed the driver software
I'm not sure why you want to do that though
now this is the dollars
the default setting works just fine
the stylus has 8192 levels of pressure
let's start using the apps
this is photoshop cs5 on the Mac and right now
this is quite good lines of versus
that's not going to be any problem
I just want to demonstrate
that pressure works here as well so
let me jump over to mischief
this is a sheath pressure
works here quite nicely too
I'm using MIDI Bank paint
Pro this is a very nice software
Troy pressure looks very well
it's like it's a bit abrupt
it's a bit more gradual so
this is something to take note off
it works fine another thing
and this is the guest now at this screen
so you actually still need
Pro it's quite smooth to work on
this is a pretty straightforward review
I wasn't able to reproduce them today
now the type of features that
Pro sometimes the brush they would behave a bit
I plug this into my computer
I wasn't able to draw all my lines very smoothly
I prefer 10 by 6 inches now
that's all for today's review
we're gonna be looking at this little thing
this is a another new tablet from bike
it is a 10 inch graphics tablet
she is quite the looker
let's get to that alright so right off the bat
I really like the box design
it just looks really nice
there we go right off the bat
it's wrapped in some very good protective materials
I think more these graphics tablets should have that
we have the pen which is a battery list pen
I don't know what the material is
pull the pen out here
it looks exactly like the one from the other bike
so it's very very light
some people like that some people
don't that'll be up to you
but the buttons feel good
it feels good in the hands
it's nice and smooth so good pen
I'm trying to get stuff out
they could probably do this a little better
let's look what was inside the box
so we're gonna peel this open
she is a beaut she's very shiny looking
I really like the just the overall design
it's very simple very sleek not overdone
you can see on the side here
you can barely see these things which
got your product information all that stuff so yeah
let's move over to installing the drivers now
we're gonna take a look at downloading the drivers
sorry that my in my overlays gotten in the way
click on your preferred one either
that is something that they say in the guide
which are those little keys there on the side there
oh that's a zoom okay
they're hard to see the buttons
do work they just take a little getting used to
I do like the scroll thing
oh yeah so just to quickly like sketch something out
it feels nice in the hand obviously
I'm whoa I am so used to this at all
please do not judge me too harshly because god
I do not enjoy them at all
it has a nice kind of feel to it
I think you'll have no problems with this
at all tablet self feels nice
it's working very well as you can see
I'm I'm fairly certain that that is this ruler
I like the look of the tablet
the material is feel smooth
they're just touch kind of like touch pads
you can kind of see them
they put like a little sticker on them
I don't know if that'll affect them or not
that would actually be perfect because then
I think it's really good
so thank you so much for watching this video
I know this was kind of a weird one
I hope you enjoyed if you liked it
that's what I'm using here
this is actually my stream setup
welcome back to a new video
so that's what we're gonna talk about today and
I care about I don't care about
I don't care if it's the what brand it is
I'm more than happy with it
so that's why I have an old iPhone 7
I think with a plastic thing anyway
let's jump into the video
I'm gonna put that in this review
so let's jump into the video
is it good enough for you you suck so
I want to show you this bad boy
three-wide why it means that it's wider
it's more of a horizontal format than the standard one
that goes have something like this and the reason
they tend to be more horizontal
it's not like you're sketching architecture
is this chord right here
the where the core goes into the tablet itself
you don't need any gadget like this
don't think they sell them anymore but they sell something
not as slippery as this one
so the tablet comes in this sturdy-looking package right here
what's inside of the package
it's in two different layers
the first the top layer is this layer
the power cable the power adapter and the stand
I'm gonna walk you through
you actually have additional nibs for your pen
should it wear out then
you need to replace it
it's really easy to adjust to whatever angle
installing the tablet is very very simple
I want it to be more neutral
the tablet comes with five different buttons
you can see them all here
um it's a lot thicker and bulkier than the one
she left her mark right there
thankfully it didn't destroy the pen
what's inside of this donut
this is actually the Pakistan
so what about this sketching experience
does it work as well as more well-known tablets
can you tell the difference
one issue you will always encounter with display
this doesn't bother me personally but
in the mail there are mainly two reasons
Tablas tend to get very warm after a while
the brightness turned all the way up
sketch sessions of 4 to 5 hours at a time
that's not a problem because I've always used the keyboard
in addition to whatever tablet
I've always had my left hand on the keyboard
ready to undo whatever mistake
I just did while the right hand to do
just click the link below in the description
I think it's time to introduce a new official
Hui on in to us
thank you for your service
i just want to say that at the moment
the tablet is running on november 2nd build
there isn't much to be said
it is a lineage os
roughly around three to five hours
i wasn't able to set it up
but that's not really a concern for me anyway
i just thought that i should mention that
thank you for watching this video if you enjoyed it
i really appreciate that anyway
hope you all have a great day
OS 7 operating system based on Android 9 and
I put my hands on
it'll surely solve the price problem
it has a vivid display and a comfortable design
the soft touch plastic makes this tablet very comfortable
however it's still good to watch videos and movies
I should also mention that it has amazing battery life
my first impressions were great
it started to lag however it still didn't disappoint me
I realized that it actually delivers great qualities
if you're using it for multimedia
I'm sure it'll solve your problems without hesitation
I will give this tablet 4 out of 5 stars
I enjoyed working with it
and this depends on the model
SD card and when it comes to the processor
it has a quad-core 64-bit intel atom z3580 processor
I wanted to know how much this tablet can handle
it did a great job with no lags at all
I'm now using it for two months
I pick up the same pad
I pick it up again
great tablets to the media pad
Oh Jack users because this one doesn't have one
the only disadvantage is that it doesn't have a 3.5
who's looking for a great tablet
even though it isn't expensive it has many great features
it's perfect for every type of tablet user
it really is simple to use and feels comfortable enough
you don't have to bring your charger everywhere
you go after using it for a couple of days
I will give the Galaxy Tab
I hope you liked the video
LTE as you might expect at those price points
the performance is kind of weak
come and this is my
that was released two years ago
it is a direct competitor to the cheaper
it is thinner with apron
and you can use microSD cards as internal storage
we get one speaker which is located above the screen
the picture quality is not that good
but yeah not that great
that sounds really bad but actually is still usable
don't get me wrong you certainly
the screen is fully laminated
and if you want to get it
6.8 gigabyte are used by the system
I guess that happens due to the one
I was able to read
Play Store you will notice
seven is much better doing everyday use
Nova types of essentialist one in android 7.0 nougat but
the performance is not great for multitasking
I'm really not sure how Lenovo is measuring that
obviously the runtime will be lower
life is great for such a cheap tablet
Lenovo tab for 8 with almost vanilla Android
alright that's my review of the Lenovo Tab 7 essential
so you might be asking what is the
Kobo tablet why do I need it
which is most of them
yeah on the back here
things can happen if you lose it
recommend that and then if
I think they have a tape
the tiles will kind of have jagged edges
they were missed you know
what you'll do is you'll unscrew
I'll do it on the next one
it should be closer to $100 in my opinion
you really do need this
see phrase in a plastic bag thought
it is through the recovery
C phrase which was now unusable
backup to your entire crypto bank vault then
I don't know it is
a bill fato crypto tag
I have a metal rack of a receipt
backup for all of them
so you definitely need these
sending me this hardware wallet
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
and this is the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet
this is the first business tablet
that's much more modern and very compact very portable
that's really nice reminds me of the samsung galaxy
SSDs ample amount of RAM and some interesting connection modules
Lenovo's first business tablet is quite some time running
Windows 10 and Intel Core M skylake CPUs
it's a two-part are technically really a three part affair
I asked Lenovo and they said yes indeed
the keyboard will always be in the box
that comes with a little toothpick
stylus that fits in the silo
AES technology that's the newer Wacom technology
it's not going to get lost
it's actually more effective than the the surface pro
4 uses the tablet ships with a citizen
numbers unlettered their 45 watt charger
some cord a decent length of cord
the tablet has a 12 inch IPS display and
it's a very good display
ThinkPad displays this one has great characteristics
we'll talk about that in depth in a minute
it is 2160 by 1440 resolutions
as a high resolution display
the tablet by itself weighs 1.7
the usual magnesium alloy and PPS plastic
it's an injection molded plastic for the casing
SSD should be accessible in there now I tried
there's no service manual out to this yet and
you have to have it at that angle
you can't go down as low as this
the kickstand is stiff enough to be effective
and it doesn't really wobble a lot
I mean you really have to
that's different a lot of laptops
1.35 millimeters of key travel
it's very pleasant to type on albeit
I'm good key damping not noisy
this is going to feel normal
it does show fingerprints and this looks like leather
now what could this before huh huh
we have more connectors that's because there are optional
modules here lenovo has three in the works
HDMI port USB 3.0 port
that's going to be around 150 dollars
I have HDMI port as well
we have a USB 3.1 standard port
USBC 3.1 point and on top over
here we have the fingerprint scanner
lay your finger on it and that works with
I love to hate the power button
it sticks out a lot really relatively speaking
it's very easy to press it
it's not one of those stiff little buttons
we have an 8 megapixel camera
they tend to have actually better front-facing cameras
this one indeed is both bright really bright 365
lenovo's done well now the bad news
well it's coated in Gorilla Glass
even just shooting this video
this one is not going to do that
it's not ever going to get hot in my experience
warm sometimes no hot and no fans no noise
it's fine for even some moderate work
I add core M has come a long way in
OneNote note taking absolutely not a problem in this office
but fast storage can mitigate that and we do have
M 5 - 6 y 5 7
that's what we have in ours
it's not bad at all really geek
Excel that sort of thing
surface pro 4 is no energizer
bunny neither is it a
37 watt hour battery Intel Core
side-by-side similar sizes similar design philosophy
just a different way of executing the kickstand
Wacom AE s-pen branded as the ThinkPad pen
honestly you get palm rejection here though occasionally
I'll accidentally trigger something on screen
it's smooth it's fluid there are levels of pressure sensitivity
I switched to the pencil and you can see
I'm getting a variety of lines
it didn't mark up here at all
follows the pen perfectly well like that
I'm not going too fast and how about jitter
I'm not the smoothest slow line line drawer in fact
I tend to draw pretty fast
I'm not seeing a whole lot of terrible jitter there
let's see what happens when we go really fast
it's quite good for some reason
mischief usually misses the beginning of my stroke
I'm using the grainy dry brush right now
it's just fine palm rejection again
it's just a little unpredictable
it's a two-piece ensemble you get the keyboard with it
yeah that's always nice from
something that's expensive is surface
pro 4 is a little bit of a hard sell
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
Tom from tech stops here coming your way and today
we're doing a review of the blackberry
I did do an unboxing on this product
it looks really nice in hand
it doesn't look too small
feels like it's made of high quality construction and materials
so if you drop it
it doesn't feel like it's got a break
you've got a hdmi port
which can stream full 1080p
it's a super vibrant screen
it's really nice and crisp
so it's not the problem at all
the multitasking and the gestures work really well
I really enjoy respect to the browser
it's very smooth and very quick
you can connect to a blackberry phone
totally that will be the case and
I'll really fix up this
i do prefer the slightly larger
iPad 2 size but seven inches
aren't that many negatives with it
I definitely consider you guys checking them out
playbook review tomm from tech stops here
don't forget to follow me on twitter
catch you guys next time
I'd try it out see what's going on
why not a tiger right check it out so
SD card slot as I saw her the display
that's why reading comics awesome fantastic
I figured you know what it's open
and we've got a 10 inch capacitive
how do you hold it you know
that's different 2160p high-definition playback
I'll noted I'll note about this
this is probably the best best
pack off-brand tamanna ever touch
it's protected it comes with headphones now
it's got the booklet for sand
and that's pretty much it for that section
we have our other compartment here
which has our sadly non-standard charger but it's cheaper
they're decent nothing nothing to write home about
you've got your power and volume rocker up
top and yet another horizontally oriented tablet for a reader
the ports are on the side so we have
we have our non-standard charger
we have our reset button
I actually didn't see that indicated anywhere besides right
microphone and it's actually for repair
I went ahead is I downloaded smart washer
I ended up getting three options
so our standard launcher is there
I can't imagine this would be poor
this is an older model and their new
this is a great deal
it comes with the one apps marketplace and get jar
it gives you some sort of
you can remove anything that's pre-built pre-installed
I've removed both of those other plate
app stores updated to Google
I I'd rather try for something that already
why not especially you know
I'm probably gonna take this bag
I I want something with no
we'll play need that comfort
this is the hybrid version of the x1 carbon
it also has that mi
you're gonna get more mileage out of the x1 tablet
the hinge on the back is built into the tablet
this hinge is very stiff
it offers a great experience
you see you have this little connector
that goes into the side
everything is pretty much soldered on to the motherboard
but you can't swap out the m2 nvme
the x1 tablet is absolutely gorgeous
it's qhd+ three thousand by two thousand resolutions
it feels like a potato and quite frankly
I don't understand why business laptops have bad webcams
I still want to mention
I think the tight cover on
it is better than the one on the surface pro
my unit is spent with the i-5 8250 you
let's say you're editing video
maybe you're a business professional
who likes to game a little bit
the x1 tablet does a fantastic job
there was no thermal throttling and even under full load
that's where things started looking a little bit different
I was getting some fantastic battery life
but with the x1 tablet
the lenovo x1 tablet is a fantastic hybrid business
I think the x1 carbon is a better buy
hey everybody get slot inside button
we're taking a look today at the new refreshed
this is an upgrade over the prior
Edition that runs a bit faster
so let's take a closer look now at the hardware
I've seen a bunch of different ads some from Amazon
they're trying to sell me an accurate earlier as well
the tablet cost one hundred and sixty-five dollars
I think it's probably just fine now
it's got a nice weight to it
it is 1.1 pounds that is about 503 grams
the screen as you can see here
you've got a 10.1 inch IPS display
Edition was running at things are really super sharp
the processor inside is the big story of this one
it does have stereo speakers
so you can pop in additional storage
it'll take up to a 512 gigabyte microSD card
the camera system on here is not spectacular
you do though have two two megapixel cameras
they've improved the front camera slightly
nothing spectacular out of this
so that is the overall hardware
things are springing up very very quickly on it
Prime video are also available on this
this comes up very quickly as well
Android you don't get the Google Play Store Amazon
so you can issue the a-word commands to it
we're going to mute out the a word so
there's one more mode to show you
show my advice would be to have
so they give you some options
we also took a look at some game emulation
they chose to put inside of it again
you're not going to get twelve hours out of it
that 7-inch only comes with a 90-day warranty
this one's good for a year
so it's just a good deal and something worth considering
it's not all that invasive
the four guys with quarters podcasts
Tom Albrecht Brian Parker in
i am going to do a quick review
I haven't covered in this video
make sure to ask them in the comments
I'll try to reply to every single one of you
okay guys one one extra thing
sorry about the background noise my mic
I'm guessing all cables all
it's the pin so you got a USB
I'm guessing that's the plug that plugs into it
cool here's the pin looks nice
it's rhett and test it
let me have a look
it's got two buttons on the side
that's plastic not meat over
that's fine put that over there
shut that over there so
yeah that's three it's eight nibs eight spin-ups
I think is four minus one
you hold the camera focus
this is the to actual tablet
it's so thin it's really thin
put that over there battery
I guess and this is instructions blah blah blah
I was wanting a glove
but that's fine if it doesn't come with it
I'm pretty sure you can order gloves
so you pretty select five bucks or something
oh you have to download the drivers online
it's called instructions so and we need that
the pen is really cooler
they really fits your hand perfectly
I guess I could try to plug it
I'll try to plug it in
i think actually hold up a sec guys
I think to plug it in
it's also got these little rubber bits on the back
I don't know if that's focusing on
I can't tell rub a bit on the back
you shouldn't that shouldn't bother you
the cable coming out the side good
tractors offer hell or car crash
I had wrapping all around it
Hui on or anything like that
well it's turning on so it basically shows this
I ever fiddle with that latex
I'm not 100% sure what hotkeys I want
so I'm guessing ctrl Z or Z
or however you want to pray on so yeah okay
so it's that one right there that button right
there is going to be used a lot for gone
basically you can change all those
I think I accidentally just Christa cause
I've never done this sort of thing for
look at that really light line
that's awesome okay that's cool
let's move over here work area
yup there's absolutely time so
I'm pretty sure it's everything work
yeah that's true our self an eyeball
I sat there for about
I feel looking for a mid-range tablet to buy
I definitely recommend it by the way guys
I'll be streaming on Twitch
I'll see you guys next time I guess
two out of its box
it has a pretty appealing
it is thin and fairly lightweight given its appearance
they look like they could provide some extra grip
I had was the screen
the 7-inch screen fills up
which is what kids will use
Nabi mode was well laid out and intuitive eight
large icons fill each screen
let's the Nabi 2 features something called spin
same goes for the music selection
it is all kid-friendly apps games and downloads
this is the actual tablet
so this is the samsung galaxy
a little two-tone with your camera up here down bottom
this is a lcd screen
but it's going to be a good picture
setups you got a five megapixel shooter
it's really easy to navigate
the screen controls work really smoothly
swiping is a breeze on here
it's solid as i'm tapping the screen
it actually does everything that it's supposed to be doing
which is a big plus
everything looks good with gaming
will this play those games
this tablet does pretty good
i have no issues out of that
it's a pretty solid tablet and for under 300 bucks
i think it's a really good buy
be sure and give me that thumbs up
please subscribe average that guy out peace
Sony unleashes on the unsuspecting masses
the protective port flaps are firmly closed
when you line the bathtub binge watching
Game of Thrones for example
we're willing to let it slide
so you won't look as squeezed in
hopefully you're not that vain
still the z2 tablet 1200
P is more than enough for most purposes
the mirror-like effect is constant
Sony uses its Xperia interface on top of Android 4.4
and you can fire up to five such resizable windows
there's this interesting track edit
that only happens when the talat is paired with
which is about 5 megapixels
the pictures come out with a vivid color representation
that is a tad oversaturated
but that's large expected with such camera indoors
we get smooth 30 frames per second 1080p
recording from the z2 tablet's camera
some recorded with the video is strong and clean
it has an excellent sound output
the slimmer slide is 10-inch tablet on the fly
among which is the high screen reflectivity
which makes it a nuisance to use
outdoors the pixel density also leaves something to be desired
UX with an excellent split-screen multitasking mode for the interface
I'll test the best 10 inch and wit slate
thanks for joining me today
starting at number 9 we have the one by
but it includes all of the essentials
you'll need to make digital art
there is a smaller version of the one by
you can even connect the end to us to select
the intros is twice as expensive as the one by
seven by five point eight inches
Pro has a whopping active area of twelve point
it supports welcomes best pen
rotation pen tilt and rotation
but it's not for everyone
six is the welcome one
one wait didn't we already do this
okay so welcome likes to reuse names
it's not essential to be honest
is that because the wacom
one is a display tablet
that's not to mention that the
I prefer a large drawing surface so clearly
I'll be sharing some advice on
and instead there's an optional
the stand can make a difference in terms of comfort
we're talking the full version of Photoshop
I absolutely love it for painting outdoors or while traveling
a powerful desktop is going to provide the snappiest performance
if money is no object
they also have folding legs like the smaller
I prefer the arm but both stands are great
these are some pretty beefy devices
these tablets are overkill for a beginner or hobbyist
I'll come back to the size issue
I know that's not the case now to be fair
so topping the list at number one is the
Wacom Cintiq 27 q HD touch
that has the same pressure levels as my high-end
I'd say if you can find a use two
check out my drawing tablet review playlist
I'll see you next time
it's the t9 3q 9 inch tablet
we're going to review it right now and beard tech
kitkat which is quite old now
just to have the tablet run properly
I'll review kingroot in another video coming soon
the screen is only 800 by 480 pixels
it also has a weird YouTube app
you'll curl up into a ball and scream a lot
another technical feature of the live wallpapers
I don't think you've ever seen it work though
it's slow sluggish bus trailing and even mystifying
Wi-Fi bluetooth it functions and stock Android
so that's good but it's still frustrating
it's an atrocious gaming device
poor multitasker bad audio device with speakers
horrible it's a terrible office tablet
they'll say you have a tablet and you say yes
it's recommended you do not buy this thing
I give it zero out of five beard
yes you heard me that
I've been Luke from being tech
this is a review of the Xcode 89 3 cube
please do not buy it
please want people not to buy it like this video
we've got a lot more reviews coming up soon
be detective in the audience
we will see you in the next one
I finally broke down and bought a Fire HD tablet
let's take a look hello
this is week number 13 of my 2019
I decided to buy one after using it
I have mixed feelings on it
it excels in some areas and in others
it just doesn't cut it as a tablet
let's see if it's worth it for you
first what do you get with the Fire
the ads can be removed for $15
up to 400 gigabytes with a micro SD card
Doby audio and a headphone jack battery
the packaging does say something about the durability
it is a plastic body with a gorilla glass screen
this thing does have a very durable feel
it is a heavy-duty device
you have to have to take you to books
video games shopping apps music audible and newsstand
I can hop to a book quickly
I see with the Fire
I'll get into the show mode features in another video
Amazon's app store that I already use
were not available you will not find
we take it for granted
YouTube app is a bummer
I find the workarounds are not a good experience
I just rather use my phone
where the Fire HD tablet lacks even with these complaints
I do need to recognize that
I like I do think the strength of the Fire
HD tablet is in consuming content
the layout makes for quick navigation to audiobooks
this device can take abuse
I don't like about the echo show
I would definitely recommend the Fire
HD tablet with the doc as an echo show alternative
so who is this for the biggest benefit
this is a great device for you
it is a content device with show mode
let me know your thoughts in the comment section
thank you for watching this
have a great day bye
do you like to check out
I think it's an improvement over the last year's tablets
I have you know checked out
I think a you can see
feel very nice and tactile
you know typing on them
the trackpad is a little bit more clicky than what
I'd like it to be
it feels a little bit cheap
I've noticed so that gives it
Windows 10 here no student Edition or anything
let's just have a look at the actual general responsiveness
you see the page loads very quickly
unfortunately there's no support for 5g
Wi-Fi boy does use 2g Wi-Fi very well everything
those are extremely fast just as faster than online
dell in terms of the responsiveness
so you can see for web browsing absolutely marvelous
RAM model 32 GB internal storage
it's like down to 8 2 gigs storage
were actually clogging up 10 gigs
take some space off the main emmc storage
I just show you the the speaker as well
I didn't even see a man
I'm no good at it anymore
well you know considering a very basic spec also
the battery is absolutely fantastic on this thing
I've been very impressed with this
what's going on guys the
CTA pride back here again
today we're gonna be taking a look at the
some of the best that
now hopefully this will change my mind
it's packing an extra gig of ram over the m8
we have our power button and volume rocker
they've also left a 3.5
millimeter audio jack for your headphones
I love about the new Lenovo
Tab series is the screens now
it definitely looks better than the ma
unfortunately this is the same
most of it can be completely deleted
I haven't had any issues at all
I'm actually connected to a server
that's pretty far away from where
HBO amazon prime Hulu Netflix and even YouTube video
so first up we have
we definitely beat out the ma
I also wanted to test out
and finally we have an 2 to 8 100 1766
Android gaming here we have King of Fighters all-stars
this really comes down to it having the same exact
is the eye peg at 91 67
we have the redream emulator running
so it's definitely not going to run every
you can also stream from your own
I'm using the I Pegah 91 67 controller
Android gaming and emulation is very lackluster
for a hundred and sixty dollar tablet
so that's pretty much it for this video guys
hello everyone welcome back to my channel
the promo code is valid till thirty first december 2020
amazon link is also provided in the description
like this you can see
let me tell you one thing
this is very very heavy so handle it with care
these two roller wheels on both sides
now let me show you the contents of this box
then you will get an hdmi to hdmi cable
then this is the power adapter and power cord
one is inside this case
if your laptop or computer has the hdmi port
these three cables are needed
inches and the resolution is 1080p
so it is showing my computer screen
this is the experiment software
you can see here xp pen artist
okay you can check the pen pressure like this
you can adjust the color temperature
srgb 5000k 6500k 7500k etc
and you can adjust the colors
i have currently assigned three features and by default
okay you can see it is changing
you can use this tablet for multiple purposes
thanks so much for watching bye bye and take care
I'll be using it now for a couple of weeks
so there's been a few little tiny minor bugs
I'm really impressed with this tablet
I just have to say that
so the price is quite good for what you get
so you have a 1080p screen here
which is a lovely screen
I've actually seen in a while
you have a two-stage kickstand here
you have hidden away a micro
I'd love to see more tablets with kickstands
there's really good the keyboard on this
I must say is really well done
I'll just show you right here
this is the surface 3 keyboard
and it's a high quality keyboard
it's just a minor complaint there
the trackpad works really well
which would put the tablet into sleep mode
so that's a tiny little minor little nibble there that
the magnets in there but overall it fits pretty good
it is powered by a Tegra 4
which isn't the latest and greatest
there's no like stutters or legs
you have that on top
is there really or the multitasking
I'll just show you in a minute
so no need for that
which is the office application
they do like that so again
I'll look here at Google
GPS wireless vibration is quite handy
I'm just going to flip over to the browser here
well it's actually all right
it's not maybe the fastest
but it's still quite good
it's the current application memory cleanup
so that's quickly just closed everything there just so
here out of the game so
this isn't the most demo demanding game
they do have a charger
V and change it in different situations
which is something you don't get on
there's also these volume buttons down here
and a fingerprint sensor the fingerprint sensor is pretty effective
I do have about it
I've been testing this device
I did start to get to use
start to get used to the volume buttons
that has a quadruple a battery on the inside
I'm not gonna subject you to watching me
click to open context menus so dependent functionality
it keeps it from overheating
this particular model was loaned to me by
it's in the same family as the core
so it's some in terms of day to day performance
there's a good reason for that
XO display which is pretty nice for most respects
I've used it for Netflix
I've used it for work
ok crank that down a little bit you just
Starcraft 2 which recently went free-to-play
I could not get that they into play at all
which is something that you've said
has this sort of fabric
there's plenty of dust and cat hair in the house
I think that that's perfectly doable
sort of full-size content when
there should be more units available
I do think that the performance is pretty good
that's for primarily document editing web browsing
this was sent to me by gearbest for reviewing
but don't worry along with all the pros
I'll also be talking about the cons
Fuji's m7o 8 has a 10 by 6 interactive area
having a larger active area means
workflow interest rule has 2
Express keys to the left and 2 to the right
I don't find having a cable attached a problem
the cable is 1.3 meters long
which is good if you have
the computer positioned at a distance but with my laptop
it's hard to say how long the battery will last
because it entirely depends on how powerful the battery unit
I also notice the surface of M 708
active area didn't get any scratches from using the pen
in comparison to the size
I'm done with this review
the settings is also very easy and pretty self-explanatory
there is no delay in the function happening what
straights produced are beautiful and flow of them
feels nice smooth and natural
I came across zero problem
the coloring was not my best mainly because
I'm still working on learning how to draw on Photoshop
there is of course some jitter even
Wacom tablets produce a tiny amount of jitter
I tested out in Clips
let's talk about how it performs on windows
I try to reinstall the Wacom drivers after you
I get when pressing an Express key is immediate
the streets produced are beautiful
the flow of ink from the pen feels really nice
I found whenever I wanted to click on something
I had no issues with clear system
the pen works flawlessly on the XPS 12
I've got no pressure levels in some programs like medivac
I had 12 have conflicting issues with Uzis drivers
let's have more than others the end 708 on Windows
I really enjoyed using Iggy's and 708
it was nice to use a larger pen tablet
honestly art is about improving step at a time
so there's no reason not to upgrade your tools
step at a time as well
that's it from me guys
i'm absolutely excited to see you guys all and today
this is the lenovo legion five
i bought for myself and around 900 us dollars
this is the budget gaming laptop according to many reviews
so i'm absolutely excited to get this unboxed
so why don't we just straight up
started okay so we have
uh and now you can see it
the lioness tech tip unboxing and i'm just really excited
how do you open this by the way
they should put this in many like budget laptops
when you just unbox this you just lift this up
yeah i like this actually
do you just literally lift laptop
get this nicely packed actually
let's see what we have down here
i'll show you then this side
oh this is actually pretty cool
this is i mean this is quite heavy
i don't think there's anything else inside here
there you go and let's put it aside
let's see if it actually has anything inside
this laptop is shipped with just this box
i'll get this box aside
you have served me well
of course i'm gonna just clip this in cool
here comes the really exciting bit
actually this is actually quite heavy so just straight up
i believe it comes from here
oh yes look at this by the way what
this is actually quite good quality
that feels like a laptop which is cool again
yeah there's some unique materials over here
that are making weird lights cool
here's the i o as you can probably see
we have two large outlets on the back
we have usb type c
we have two usb type
a's we have one hdmi
that's quite cool and we have a
i don't think that's 2.0
and that's kind of the outside
okay so from the looks of things
there's two large fans i can see the fan blade
there are two speakers on the side
it's it feels pretty well built
that is too much fingerprint
now this feels all right
it feels pretty good and let's get this open
around the hinge over here
the hinge looks pretty cool
it's slightly green for some reason and the edge
i don't know if you can see or not
okay i can open one hand which is really cool
okay and get this silky stuff down
it looks quite sleek obviously
it doesn't really look like a game
this actually looks pretty nice
and an nvidia gtx 1650 cool
uh now let's give it a touch
oh my god this actually feels really nice
uh i really like this kind of texture
let's give it a touch
oh yes i see why the reviewers say that
like it's the clicks are really really obvious
the screen looks decently big
uh there's a promising shot over here on the webcam
let me just show you over here
hello hello hello please focus okay
get the lenovo logo over here again
you know logo over here you get this
i mean if this laptop is any lighter this hinge
um yeah it feels quite well built
i really like it first impression
i guess let's just press the button
this is free feels like pretty
i guess that's all for today's video
i stopped thinking about owning one today
the tablet sports an 11.6 inch ips
and you wouldn't feel comfortable holding it single-handedly
and at times i use it for watching netflix
i was of course careful enough not to open too
yes but maybe not you see
i like the fact that this product gives me
- What's the best tablet deal of the year?
(cash register dinging) (upbeat, warm music)
And, I have a huge giveaway.
I got a lot of requests since a video
Alexa, are you better than Siri?
They both respond at basically the same time.
Maybe a second apart between the two tablets.
The iPad has a better processor.
Let's look at a YouTube video.
Video load time actually identical between the two.
I love to do the humor test.
Alexa, tell me a joke.
- [Alexa] Knock, knock. Who's there?
No, thank you, I'm allergic to nuts.
- [Siri] Matt, I don't really know any good jokes.
None, in fact. - Seriously, they have to reprogram.
The streaming video on the HD 10 is amazing.
Yes, it's great in Itunes.
Everything is optimized to an extreme.
I mean, this is $150.
Keep in mind, this is not a Kindle.
Don't worry, I paid for the damage.
You wanna watch that video.
No crack. And, now let's do the front side down.
You know, guys, this is a stainless steel table.
Totally unscathed, and still, completely touch-responsive. Everything's working.
Oh, my microphone and my...
Perfectly good, perfectly responsive, no movement whatsoever.
Like, it works, which is absolutely amazing, given that...
See? It's still loading. This is...
Let's look at the table.
The tablet is completely fine.
Look at that. Absolutely fine. The table, not so much.
Alexa, what's the weather in Toronto?
Seems like a cool job.
Alexa, turn my couch light off.
Alexa, play music by Madilyn Bailey.
(tablet rings softly) - [Alexa] Shuffling songs by Madilyn Bailey.
(tablet playing pop ballad music)
Sorry, I absolutely love the way
the content looks on this.
I had to buy my own.
You want yours for free?
Congratulations goes to, Connor Rebooted, you wanted a Nintendo Switch.
Yes! You've won! Whoo! Awesome.
- I'm proud of you, too.
And for those of you
Just click on my head
right here, that'll subscribe you to this channel.
this is the high ten plus
and what makes this extra special is
it's actually a dual boot tablet
it is not a great performer by any means
I'm not impressed at all with the camera
quality but then who takes photos with tablets anyway
we've got an Intel 64-bit quad-core said seven
SD card slot if we look down on the bottom
we've just got a little pinhole microphone just about here
the back of the device looks very very nice
indeed it's in this gray color and overall
I think this is a really good tablet now
it has also got a front-facing camera but what
I'm being completely honest here
I think the display is very very good indeed
it's a great little tablet decent performance
very very good price and indeed
this is the chewy high 10
leave them in the comment section below
don't forget to hit that like button
hi folks how you all doing today
I want to look at the arts
this is a 1920 by 1080p screen
which is pretty usual for a 15.6
this is a coated screen
obviously one of the few drawing tests that
I've done on this as well
which is why you're looking at the tablet upside down
just left-handed people like me
the jog wheel feels pretty nice
it has 8000 levels of pressure
it's a pretty decent feeling pen nice and solidly built
so here's the pen case
it's made of a really nice feeling felt
I I was really surprised by this
it's just a really nice thing
I found a free gift of twenty nibs
twenty nibs is pretty good next up the stand
it has a lot of different adjustable levels
there's an instruction manual as well for the tablet
I never read these things personally
I don't but there you go
it's there it is Illustrated
oh yes you get an artist glove hahahaha again something
this is a standard wall outlet
I don't think it does
the lines are consistent as much as
I'm getting thick when I want thick
I'm getting thin when I want thin and getting fast
I'm nice smooth even lines
I don't use lines moving in my test
you should never do that because you will get lag
that's just an old wives tale now
the parallax and their parallax is virtually zero
which is absolutely awesome for a budget
this is pretty awesome for a tablet
so that's the pen test and while that works
so yeah because this doesn't have till at least
yeah so let's test that out
who here is a big fan of the
Dark Crystal show on Netflix
I'm drawing at the moment
I found this about some of the budget
it's a nice inexpensive application
I the one thing is from this camera angle
the matte finish doesn't look right
here you can see there's different straightaway
why would you need to be color
a tablet like this requires all of my minimum requirements
you know it's 15.6 so 16 inches
I used most as you can see by you
I think it's personal choice
that's actually four different draw tests
you can google that you know your respective countries
can you know make your own
I hate doing comparison videos
that's right for you go for the biggest screen possible
I can produce some decent art even though you know
it doesn't have the best pen in the world
I'm putting so many different pen tests in here
I want to do a longer sketch
they were kind of flocked covered
I don't know how to explain it
but that's how ideas happen
I'd like to know what that looks like
I spent an hour so drawing that
I had in my weird imagination
you know the hokies the stand
this actually got down exactly what
I had in my weird little imagination
here is my final draw test now the reason
I've done so many draw tests
has you know all the hotkeys
it's not for you guys who are like me who
it is a tablet made for those just starting out
this is the kind of tablet
somebody's life who who's this their first tablet
this is their second tablet
this is allowing them to start their journey
this is an image from a Christmas
there's nothing wrong with this tablet
I've been on many tablets just like this
I was drawing on digital
a drawing tablet like this would have been a godsend
it has a quick dial all programmable
I've made in these draw tests
I would love to hear your thoughts and comments below
I chat to you all soon

white maybe here with these rubber end caps and here
this does not have a user replaceable battery
it has 16 gigs of internal storage
put your own movies on there
pictures whatever it is you want
Buy you have to buy it separately for I believe
it requires power to operate
this is what the box looks like
you can see the best by co-branding on here
Tegra phone results on Linpack
it did a stunning 47 of course
Linpack does favour Qualcomm GPUs
and that's what this hasn't signed but still very impressive
so you can see the three of them together
obviously they're similar in size
HTC looks you know like an HTC phone kind
7 inch the grandfather of 7-inch
I guess you could say obviously science wise
it's very easy for your fingers in your eyes

you can choose your brush
you can use an ink a highlighter paint
I'm going to go with red

and we're going to take a look at Jane
its opening in the book

you can change your display language
pick the account that you use with
Kobo books and again you can choose your font size

basically it's good for you
we'll take a look at watch
we do not have an account on this store
this can play 480 and 720p video 1080p video
that's a pretty high bitrate video
it's looking very nice the 1.5 gigahertz processor and
it's doing a good job
third person has a YouTube player
it should work with as well
we're going to take a look at HDMI output
but it's not bad looking either so that's HDMI output
it's a very nice 7-inch tablet
this is the fact that it doesn't run
they're a very popular sense on a tablet
The tablet worked great in all five programs
None of the other programs had this issue.
The PD1560 costs less than similar tablets from other companies.
The screen has a protector over it.
You can leave it on or take it off.
I’d be worried about the screen
getting scratched over time without a protector.
Wearing a glove helped reduce the oil
Then I put the screen protector back on.
The tablet comes with a pen.
Pen holder filled with extra tips.
The bottom of the holder is a pen tip remover.
A screwdriver and screws for the stand.
This is actually really cool, and I wasn’t expecting it.
I don’t feel worried at all about using the case.
The stand is heavier than the tablet.
It’s the most portable screen tablet I’ve used.
Take your folded up stand and turn it so
the long bar goes toward the top of the label.
Insert the bottom two screws into the holes.
place the stand on the tablet as is.
You’ll feel the screws line up with the holes.
Screw in the top screws, then the bottom screws.
This stand has such a wide range
Even this far up it’s pretty stable though.
Next take your combo cable
Press the power button on the side of the tablet
and you’re ready to go.
You may need to charge your pen.
Uninstall any existing tablet software
you have and unzip and install the driver.
Once you’ve installed, restart your computer.
Press the Auto button until the menu is gone.
click the tablet icon and Run As Administrator.
Do this a second time to get into the controls.
you can change how sensitive your pen is.
on your main monitor, right click, Display Settings.
In my case it’s 1.
Notice how the settings are upscaled to 150%.
Change the scale to 100%.
Close this and run the tablet again.
If you are left handed, check this 180 radio button.
Now everybody click Monitor Calibration.
Then your pen will work.
Press the Menu button to enter an option.
Press the Auto button to go back one step.
The PD1560 has a lot of options, which is nice.
the default colors were rather good.
The colors change a lot
It is more expensive, slightly
Here’s the quality ranking for the tablets
I’ve used as of this video.
so ye let's do dias okay so he
hey okay so this is another review
I got sent this tablet from Helion
I got excited and I opened
thank you for choosing this little little lion thing
if this will focus sorry
my camera is still broken
I never really had a tablet pen
what there's a weird actually love it
let me let me open a swimming
Wow it's open with magic
I know I know what these buttons do
I guess I have to figure out what this is
I don't know what this metal ring is for
I I can't review cords man
I mean it's just a regular cord
it looks like it's really long too
the cord is really short as you can see
I probably should read it
I love it so brushes okay
it's really really tiny and small
I absolutely enjoy drawing with it
I was fairly surprised that throughout the entire time drawing
I'm a very minimalistic person
that are on the go
it is a smaller tablet
I'm not really into that kind of lifestyle now
I just wished that it would
I'm trying not to repeat myself because I really do
I've already talked about why I loved it
I just it's it's just been such a long time
I wish I had this whenever I first started out
we're not talking about my poor decisions around pets
I highly recommend this tablet
this is 100% my own opinion
now you know what this toilet is capable of that
I will see you later again
we on for sending me this tablet
Welcome to something a little bit different.
We are reviewing the XP-PEN Artist
that has a few extra bells and whistles.
It’s worth noting that unlike the pro
Thanks for listening, and I will see you next time.
hello this is a very quick look at the
3 tablet is no exception
I collect peripherals for many different systems
Wacom Hey well I come for the Wii
that sounds bad out of the box
the system itself is well designed and quite sturdy
the tip of the stylus acts as a button itself
and there's a long one to the side
oh you're got the wheel come down like that
Wiimote into some future games
it's small and can tuck away very nicely
it's not like other game peripherals
Stein stylists steel steel scissors
they mean 30 minutes of actual drawing okay
I see see every time you make a line
it counts towards your 30 minutes fractions of seconds
geez dad use your imagination haha
it gives an explanation of tools in the manual
and then how to do something
but there's no practical application that walks you through it
then teaching them how to use it is real essential
now it's not a sensor per se
if you want to use that bit of a program
is that it's not made from left-handed people
it's a genuine one now
this is a kid's toy
look ma no mess all in all
it's a nice game and a nice peripheral
there's a 30-minute time limit for your artwork
but there's so much more room for expansion
Nintendo y-component n-no I think I will draw it Chuck
it's gonna make you gawk now that doesn't work
display are relatively thin as well
the display itself is very crisp
it has good contrast and viewing angles the only concern
is the display size itself
the software is very appealing out of the box
the meet pad 3 is running
multitasking is not available with this version of me
UI I read a report that said 'my UI 9.0
will be coming to this device in
you can do this on other
it's reminiscent of a full-fledged laptop or a desktop
I think it's pretty neat
it's being powered by a mediatek mt6752
the biggest con is the lack of roms got support
found in many flagships out there under the hood
we have a 6600 milliamp hour battery
give or take you get a fast
Android tablet with a good screen and amazing build quality
the biggest problem I have with it
I mean I mentioned that earlier
I'm Billy HT from phone Doug comm
I hope you enjoyed this video
there is 150 dollars there
acer is not paying me to make the video
i don't get to keep the tablet
I happen to like Acer products
I personally own the Acer Tab 8 tablet
I'm not much for the smaller ones
I watched movies on this thing
let's do business in the bathroom
hey there Konya 110 helps me
keep from being bored on the treadmill
you want to stay fit for the ladies
let's make a viral video feed
you is so not one of the things
I love about a tablet including the Acer
so we have a 10.1 inch 1280 by 800
IPS display on here LED and which makes it HD
the color is beautiful on its colour
reproduction is really awesome on their comes with
it gives you easy note
okay to sum up why
it comes with a very colorful bright
IPS display it is HD
gigs of flash storage and a micro SD card slot
you're getting a lot for your money
hi this is teal from
they sent me this unit for review purposes
so let's take a look at the tablet itself
this is the packaging box by the way
the working area of the tablet is actually thirteen
point eight inches by eight point six
so this is a very big tablet
let's open this up and show you
thank you cut the manual
there are four extra nibs and there's this nib remover
the battery is also non removable
life is quite good actually
let me turn this on
this will turn blue the top line here
the battery is running low
as for the surface of the tablet
Wacom tablet and this is a medium sized Wacom tablet
I can install the drivers from this time drivers
just at the corner of this tablet
alright let's talk about using the tablet on their
let me show you how to do that
just click on this advanced setting button
if you are left-handed you can check this button here
that's all there is to customizing the pen and tablet
that's absolutely no lag at all
the curves are very smooth as well
no jagged lines or anything on
Mac os10 I find a drawing experience to be flawless
the lines come out exactly the way
I want them to be
I'm using the Microsoft Surface pro 4
I install the free own drivers
Pro fall as mentioned earlier
this is actually a thumb
drive with eight gigs of storage
I plugged it in windows
open up this folder to show me
what's inside the thumb drive
I'm just going to minimize that now
I'm going to open photoshop
I did find some glitch
these are actually two separate lines
sometimes it doesn't so it's quite frustrating
I recommend you install this software called lazy Nezumi Pro
this comes with a trial version
I'm going to draw several lines
this is the first line
then you don't have to buy this because other applications
they actually work quite well
drawing performance with this tablet is very smooth
I have tried this with Photoshop
cs5 cs6 on windows 7 and 10 all of them
I don't have any problems with Mac OS overall
I will say this is a very good tablet
it works the buttons here works
the pen works very well too
that's all for my video review today
so you can go and download them and try them
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
Android tablet currently on the market
we're to take a look at that in a minute
after we do the hardware tour you see
there's a sensor for a dock connector over here
it's gotten a lot of fingerprints already
looks nice and feels nice other than the fingerprint nation
I want to block wireless reception
you have dual speakers here at stereo speakers
here's your five megapixel autofocus main camera
this is your power button right here
and you'll have to send that back to
it's quite a thin device or a tablet feels nice
Samsung Galaxy Tab Android OS
you might be able to fit the Galaxy
Taman now here we have it next to the iPad
you can see they're about the same length
iPad is wider though and in terms of weight
they're about the same at each one point
we'll show you in a minute
and this case that's 39 bucks
it's kind of neat case
this also $70 in fact
just fine and you can set it up
that said the on-screen keyboard is so good
but it's nice to have that option
this has a dual core
hopefully it will be soon via a software
update that's a bit weird it's running android
Talk video chatting and we test
so it's free and it works with
ok let's take a look
this is the new honeycomb interface right here
so you won't be using over cellular
we've got a million heavyweight applications running in the background
you can choose widgets app shortcuts wallpapers and others stuffing
are the hardware buttons now
there's a software control here
this is the back button and keyboard
this is your multitasking button
we have a lot of apps actually running right now
you've got your status here
I got my tweet caster running and telling me other
some applications installed the music player running in the background
I can just tap on that to start it again
we have just your time wi-fi's battery status
they're also tapped over here
you get more stuffing switch to airplane mode
Android 3 you go back home again now
and this is a side-scrolling
many of these are actually my own that
the web kit base web browsers are really awesome
they're quite small surprisingly for
you can do that before
you're playing find out what the movies are
and we'll just play transformers
we've got the main YouTube interface first
so you've got your wallet
this is not Flash 10.1 10.2
it should play those videos well
you've got fancy pagesturning animations just like apples
I booked page slider here
this can make a very nice ebook reader
of course there is screen glare
that's one thing for those of you prefer ink
we've got our own website going right here
this is the following gadget site
which as you all know is very heavy
there's no problem with that
now you have that so clearly
it's a beautiful browsing experience
and let's take a look at another page
the art time tom page
I'm not sure you expect much from this
what's actually looking quite nice
so here we are in Google Maps
and obviously this is bigger than most portable navigation
thanks we're gonna look at movie studio
I suppose is better than nothing
that's movie studio so yes
that's included with the tablet
ready really quickly for the tablet here
of course it says the Android Market
it's not quite the look that you're used to
these scroll independently if you want to search you
don't here and here you can see the keyboard then
this doesn't ship with one
and now we'll check out you do
Tegra 2 processor which is very fast
this is just a joy to use
it's so quick and responsive
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
you give us review and i was like give me
wow this is really big
um can i have some help please
and um here it is
i'll be doing a fun
um but as you can see
i don't think we need any of these boxes now
wow i don't know it's like you feel that
actually you can't feel it
actually let me open up this case this
this case feels pretty nice
oh and it also has the gaomon logo
what else is inside of this box
obviously right here we have the actual drawing tablet
this is a 15 inch
so let's see if i can open this up
that's a lot of express keys
this is actually a very small stand
um let's open it up
let's see what else comes in here
just kind of peels open
i think the stylus are pretty durable
it feels really nice and light settling
now let's get into the review
it has a battery free
i'm gonna pretend i know what that means
this tablet comes with a pre-installed
this tablet is 15.6 inches
hey folks how we all doing today
it's kind of winding down
and i looked at how much they are
and they're like 350 to 650 dollars
somewhere in that pool park
let's face it um also
i won't really need or use
i explained this and they were like it's fine river
so that's what i'm gonna do
i want something that feels like
it's not going to fall apart at any moment
i want it to feel good
i want the picture to be clear
okay so inside the box
um a little bit grubby there on the side
there's a dual camera and look
you just press the button
it's got that center home button in the middle
but i have to say it doesn't bug me
it is a little tinny
what sort of pressure to apply
obviously my ipad feels a bit more luxe
i've actually ended up preferring the feel of this
it doesn't feel too delicate
the edges aren't too curved and too rounded
it's just right the color
reproduction seems perfectly faithful to my eye
that understand all those big words okay
it's very useful it's android 9.0
pi enhances performance and reduces ads
i'm going to be honest with you
the 8 megapixel is it's adequate
you can store tons of photos
ebooks songs and movies and also actually
this is a great plus point here
you can quickly get answers
take calls play a song
check the temperature control smart devices
and and with that micro hdmi port
it also features a 5v2a micro usb power adapter now
i have heard different reports
let's have a scroll through things
they've been saying on amazon
the top reviews good and bad
they immediately shipped out a replacement
so far we've had no problems with the replacement amazon
i use it all day and it worked very well
it's a great product for the price
okay so that's five stars
another five star verified purchase
here great value hits all the marks
i needed a tablet to read emails
sounds a bit like me
this device fit the bill perfectly
i used it heavily ever since i received it
does that mean anything to you guys
i could find no setting to resolve the issues
okay well lisa sounds like
but he's given it four stars
he sent emails to tablet express support
didn't hear from them ended up contacting amazon support
hasn't had any problems quite satisfied
jack q chan this time around was exceptional
okay so a few blips there
tv tablet's a good price
so i bought it for my two-year-old's daughter
she used it to watch tv
she used it to watch tv
it has clear picture and nice
life almost does my ipad 2.
another glowing five-star report from stephen gilroy
i ordered this just before it was released
so it might be different
more wi-fi connects via five gigahertz
don't they guys i'm pretty fair
the camera is not absolutely amazing
it does what i need to do
but that's why they charge
you need to be constantly gaming you know
this isn't going to be for you
you're just going to find it frustrating
the sound is not superb
no problem i'm just jumping in here to mention that
i know that for myself personally
i'm not doing that but we're all different
we've all got different expectations different needs
how i make my videos disclaimer
i am not a professional at this field whatsoever
it's basically like timelines or like thumbnails
on how the animation is gonna look
media bang paint is not an animation program
but i try to work with it
and why don't you try
learning an animation program is stupid
yeah no i'm too lazy
of course you gotta add your audio in this video
i'm gonna do two time by jack
it's basically like the standard youtube size
it's completely up to you if you want to
color or shade your animation
here's a quick unboxing video
so uh using this tablet for a while
paint isn't an animation program
guess what card animator 4 is wait
it's the cartoon animator 4.
here you can see me
this was pretty worth it
probably thank you and goodbye you
today have a very highly requested video
Wacom tablet but right off the bat
I'm gonna say that the Wacom splash
Wacom tablet out there but for me
and then we're finding them digitally in the daily straighter
it's also really handy for digital hand lettering
1 table is very smooth
indeed there's a button in the
I find so in closing
GT as you can see
design your future today peace
Pro like the one before this one
let's let's open the box
thank you for choosing chu-young warranty stuff
it's got all these little buttons
I think this is a drawing glove
um this is weird yeah
um this here is a gift
you all shouldn't have really
here's the pin lovely is this
I guess these are extra nibs cool
all right and pen goes like that eat
looks like it uses a mini
I'm looking forward to this
this here is a drawing that
maybe enhance the color and shadow of these cords
Photoshop like there are five different ways to do this
I think that was part of the problem
I just had some some wonky computer issues and stuff
I guess we're doing a review video
I think it has eight thousand something different pressure points
this is a really simple drawing
I bought a big brush
pack from them pretty affordable
I don't know if that still exists
I'm gonna be doing this unboxing today of this
quality can be quite important
let's see it has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core Atom processor
I believe it's Z 37:35
so we're gonna see how that works out
32 gigabytes of flash memory
I'm not too concerned about that
SD card slot USB and Bluetooth
so you can actually dock this tablet you can see
this is important because if you used some of these
so this is interesting so
the screen quality is pretty good
this is in fact an intel atom z3580 gigahertz
it is a dual core system
so when you get the system do expect to have
Windows do its update and tie up
there does have a 32
it supports up to 32 gigabyte s microSD card however
there was no problem with it whatsoever
I don't have any problems with too much lag here
that's not bad at all
actually this is very usable okay next
I noticed by typing on this last night
what about battery life well
the brightness is great by the way
I haven't had any problems with it
it is a little bit slower than you know
I like to have that paired with good battery life
there was no problem whatsoever overall do
I said I did have
and how does that compare to this unit
hello everyone it's me again and today
let's get into the unboxing when you open the box
here's a little baggie filled with things
I'm gonna go play melee
it also came with an extra pen as a gift
wow how do they know that
I constantly lose my tablet pen specific
the stand is pretty cool
I'm super hurting my back
II kind of touch screen thing
so drawing on this tablet was pretty nice
Photoshop and I didn't have any problems with the driver
the pen is actually really light and nice
it doesn't come with a pen
stand or anything though so what
my posture is really bad
it feels kind of awkward
being a second monitor it is not a touchscreen
was that the middle button
quality on the tablet is phenomenal
it looks really beautiful and bright and vivid
I don't see any errors in that
the quality is also phenomenal
quality is really nice like the physical quality
although you're sacrificing the fact that it isn't a touchscreen
I have to kind of put a book behind it
I definitely recommend this once
it's not a super beginner tablet though
I hope that you guys like this
