but you get a usb-c charger and a wall plug you get a two-year warranty which is cool
and then we'll scroll and use the um sort of this is a high demand website for sure
so i'll zoom in and just uh hit go and you can kind of see those results
it's something that's going to get you a good android experience with a good screen and a good battery life
and so i think it'll if it fits in your budget and kind of does um media and entertainment
why i like this tablet is because it has this something at the bottom that make the table
and if you are in mac download the mac driver once you download your driver you open it here
so i'm going to start drawing now and let's see if we find any issue you can say
i don't really have anything much to say because i think this is a good tablet
it is good for beginner and also for professional when i was drawing i didn't find any issue at all
hey MJ here for tech reporter TV today with a review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab
a 7.0 the first 7-inch tablets from Samsung's Galaxy Tab A series that was introduced last year
it's one of the cheapest tablets out there with a starting price of one hundred sixty nine year
we're starting with the design and build quality and the design is very typical from Samsung
it feels relatively high-end considering the price there's some texture on the back which means you don't see fingerprints
it will transform into a mirror like most tablets but for the price to the display
it's a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor from spread room together with 1.5 gigabytes of memory of RAM
I installed modern combat 5 then I could install it with our problems and play it with our problems
test a1 a 720p video over and over again and the brightness will set to 50%
I'm a solo every time it comes with that free time which I really believe is very useful for kids
you just went back for and there's nothing to it you're gonna have control of what
it's going to be very frustrating if you keep up with it and there's just nothing in it
but the pen they shipped it with just wouldn't respond to our inputs on the tablet itself
i was ready to give up this whole ordeal which is also why this review took so long
but the size of this thing alone makes something like this a no-brainer and working with it extremely comfortable
unlike the tablet itself which is a hefty piece of hardware especially with the holster behind it
plus they sent us a pair of those drawing gloves to make it a bit easier on their hands
i'd say look into one of these as i'm happy to own mine make of that what you will
venue eight with a faster processor lighter design and an improved camera over the previous generation sitting in its optional
you'll find a micro USB sync and charge port um battery charging status LED the volume rocker a microphone
port and a concealed micro SD card and micro SIM card slot area on the front face
port that offers reasonably loud sound within certain expectations for a tablet of course the optional
here is inductive charging and it's only available with the Dell Venue 8 3840 line of tablets
Dells new Intel dual core powered tablet trailing a bit which is specifically a CPU bound test
i'm not particularly interested in boxes but a lot of people are and it's quite difficult to open actually
uh here it is here it is uh as i said a 10.1 inch and first of all
you know if you go lower you're gonna see pixels but uh not a bad display for the price
uh the six thousand milliamp battery full of any charges in probably two or three hours so not bad there
this was another thing that appealed to me this device comes with three gigabytes of ram
and it's got three gigabytes of ram on it and three gigabytes are working and available for your consumption
and i think the three gigs of ram a little bit wasted on it but it all works
i haven't had anything that didn't work but there is a little bit of lag there
i'm afraid uh the wi-fi very good connects fast stable good speed all over the place
i'd say five to six hours of screen on time from the six thousand milliamp battery
it's not bad so you know you know it's powering a good screen a good good display
and it's not offering me any wireless updates of any sort so i've got a suspicion
um depends where you live on the prices but you know british pounds in the uk
it's just a shame that if they haven't banged in a faster better processor to make it a bit quicker
you know that's my view on it all the best and i'll catch you next time
I was selecting this but I came across a lot of reviews that from this game called OSU players
they're called and extractor tool and a glove for using the tablets feels like pretty good quality um
when you're drawing it can sense how hard you're pressing to make it wider or thinner the line
you can get the picture all right so as you can see it works pretty well pretty accurately
the tablet itself feels pretty solid and well put together with a matte surface all around
pan the canvas change the brush size or do whatever you program it to do unique for this holiday version
I kind of like because it makes me feel like XP pan and know their target audience
it's something I haven't seen any other brand do and it's just a fun little detail next
Huyen one I've been using for a while now but the thickness is pretty much the same the case itself
it's too customizable buttons on the pen here as well just like we're used to and personally
Photoshop you also get a sketching glove and a cool calendar with this version of the artist
you'll need to connect the tablet to your computer via USB and if the USB port is powerful enough
I'm using an iMac and I don't need the wall plug to run the tablet however
I don't want you to miss out on that because it's so satisfying to see so here
the display color gamut is 88% NTS C 120% s RGB resolution is 50 80 LPI
as usual here and just want to put down some lines to check the pressure sensitivity and accuracy
and you're good to go then download the drivers and do some calibration if you want to
I didn't really expect less since most of the tablets I've tested so far are so similar to each other
that the only difference is the layout of the customizable buttons as long as the pressure
I wanted to show you the distance from the actual tip of the pen and the stroke on the canvas
this can take a little while to get used to since the thickness of the screen
it should allow me to focus on the design work and help me get the result
a brand so do your research and check reviews like this to make your decision before you buy something
I hope this video is useful to you and I hope you enjoyed this short redesign as well
you don't have to use the default one right so i'm testing it on board now as you can see
if you're teaching mathematics this is also very simple to use very cool right and i can draw
you know anywhere you like and you can start doing the writing or scrap scribbling when you're teaching online
don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more reviews and also don't forget to like this video
which means it's going to be kind of along the lines of your LG televisions that aren't OLED
so when you're when you're only a few inches away with your face in some cases
I can't really imagine wanting that I mean yes my Alienware laptop screen is brighter my Samsung TV is brighter
it's perfectly fine and the colors are represented accurately so that's fine then with that high contrast ratio
perfectly glossy shiny glass so it does look nice but it could be an issue for reflections
so at least you have the options you will see some kinda like coloration issues from the screen
you'll lay like plastic on top of a screen that happens but once you turn it on
I haven't noticed any issues at all with that as far as inputs go we have HDMI DVI and VGA
I put a little cable keeper tightening around all three cables the power cable USB cable and the HDMI cable
it's not an issue at all so we did mention the display stand and how that could affect the cords
the last thing to mention about the unit itself is that it does not have any
but that's it so that's a deal-breaker for you then there you go but for me
but supposedly the lasts that long it takes about an hour to charge and it does give you
so that's useful you also get eight needs eight nib replacements if you happen to wear them down
I've had the glove from the GT 190 for a year now and it hasn't really worn at all
that's all of the official stuff so the last thing to talk about is just that it looks very nice
it's got a nice silver bezel going all the way around and it's got nice build quality
which is a lot more money but you know it's for what it is it's very very solid
and here's the thing at this price point there's really not a competitor that appears to be better
I haven't used it so I can make a direct comparison but it more than double the price
I'm not getting a commission for saying any of this by the way I'm just letting you guys know
I was next shinin on my exhale was next did I be pissed off at this sound
I can hear my friend you and me I he's just a little I can you
I've never talked in this channel before, meet Artisul, concretely the D 22s model of display table as always
if you had one, the pros and cons and will do a speedpaint at the end to test it out.
When opening the box the first thing we see are cables a power adapter and an HDMI.
it allows us to draw in tilt up to 90 degrees maximum control over your own preference in angle
since there's no pen holder included in this model we can find a bunch of free nibs
but there's some for light adjustments the IPS screen looks like it doesn't have a strong reflection
I'm changing the screen to work as a complementary one and I'll calibrate it had no problems at all
I do for days when the device is uncomfortable also I want to highlight the quality of the display
i would say this tablet is brilliant and also it has a ips display with a built-in bluetooth 5.0
i'd like to go to the storage so i want to show you now without downloading anything
so from a gig you got around 56 gig to use to download anything or use it
um google system languages you can change the languages there as well about tablet etc now
this is a tablet that i would say is worth every penny and i would highly recommend it
Haku Bellini big quantity remaining 314 okay overall upon a cheetah okay so below market rate overall
okay basically today about the other buggy do have screen protector put up a sonic screen protector
okay the blue here to go said things to me check that said things of the
what are the other one off potato but also within that connected so making a mess on
I can't see because it's kind of dark but up here there's gonna be a headphone jack
you have a volume key here but this was kind of funny and you have a volume up as well
and then recent apps button say recent apps when they pull up are going to be up and down
I'll open up some photos that I took so these are some photos that I took with this
this is with the control over the light on when I turn the light off you can see
it doesn't really have good dark light photos in there so overall this tablet is gonna be great
I honestly probably go with this one just because I like regular Android better and comparatively speaking
it's gonna take a little bit longer to load apps and load websites again because it's a low powered device
okay so they offer a two-year warranty on all their products and they've got 100 day money-back return policy
so if you don't like the product within 100 days you can return it and they'll be here
I want to talk about my six favorite features of the n120 19 edition first up
we have this huge lovely great-looking screen okay and for the money you're getting a 10.1
it's a big jump up from some of the older versions of Android and yeah fantastic
that neo core are pushing this to their recent devices so another big thumbs up okay
and you've got a hundred days to return it if you're not happy with a product
I know I said I was going to make six points that I liked about the tablet
I do want to throw in one more bonus point there that I had forgotten about
so when they come out of the box straight away you can have a screen protector on there
and you find some benchmark information and other details at lilliputian it's fine for single tasking
now let's play a video talk more about the keyboard in a second viewing angles are pretty good there
it's sort of a little bit more like a cross between Android and Chrome OS in some ways
now you notice it doesn't resize perfectly here so let's go ahead and reload that page and then
oh you got it okay anyway so using the pen you can sort of go through games like this
well it's pressure sensitive but not all applications are no so like I recognize the pressure sensitivity
my handwriting and my drawing abilities are not necessarily top-notch as you can tell so it's something
Linux you have access to to those tools and you can install applications using sudo so I've got installed here
that's a little bit more expensive than an entry-level iPad which sells for $2.99 to edgy customers
I really for the most part enjoy using this device when I spend $329 on it
Amazon Fire HD 8 as my primary tablet for those purposes but for the education market
i have things to say so i've been doing digital art for about four years now and over that time
clunky had loads of wires in the back that the sand rested on yet to charge the pens
there's only one wire that's actually attached to the screen itself which is much better than the mountain of cables
make sure all the things are set up properly with the driver and then you're good
it's a great size easy to move around the setup and a lot of fun to work on
and we've teamed up with curio and internet matters to talk to you about the kirio tap connect
brilliant brilliant and the other thing which I really like is you can actually remotely turn it off
we're going to be taking a look at a very interesting tablet from huion so today we have something interesting
but this is not sponsored - didn't pay me and yeah they wanted me to review this and say okay
oh wow it even has like like mac and Windows versions but yeah for an unboxing
I'm gonna read off the options that they say that this is designed for pen signer
which so if you're wanting to sign a document drawling which is fair writing so handwriting interesting
draw something as a software because that actually looks like its own image it's got 2048 pressure sensitivity levels
so if you want to upgrade to get a little bit more to get some buttons on it that's fine
I'm guessing that's reports per second again 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity apologies for the stuttering and stuff
now if you if you shrink the resolution of your monitor down then it'll actually translate a lot better
but if you're using like 1080p or even 720 every little motion will be a drastic motion on screen
I think that this is for kind of a big for someone who's a professional artist
Commission work or works in a business and stuff like that if this is going to be
I what this could be if you're professional of like a more higher tier so you're doing this for work
if you're a pixel artist you can do kind of small movements and stuff like that
it's again $15 it's really easy to pick up and it's good to have around like
yeah this is a weird one but I want to thank you all for stopping by and watching
Bell notifications to stay up to date on all my videos and content down in the description
um i don't know what more to say about it other than it's it's you know
you have the stylus with it which we will get onto a bit later on then
now let's get on to the actual tablet so this is the thinnest tablet in the world
also what's cool is it has palm rejection technology which means you can comfortably place your palm
so you have things like video story boards you have to-do lists however i don't really use them that much
black gray and white the eraser function is also really cool so you can erase a selection
you can also choose different languages and if you are not right-handed but you are left-handed
practically speaking i've been using this for a few months now and you know what i absolutely love it
i can't remember the last time i took out my notebook and pen and started writing with that also
even a phone but now let's go on to some areas for improvement so firstly the pen tips
they will take the pen tips and smash it and your pencil will be gone within like a minute
you can get a tablet with way more features but what this device offers is something unique
hello guys i am nia and i'm here to do this review video of vague x-640 as you can see
uh it's not too big for my desk and it's 8 000 levels of pressure guys 8 000
these there's obviously debate whether 7-inch or anything from nine to 10 inch tablet is ideal
which will be a little better and you can actually see the pinch to zoom in action
the accelerometer you can see how that works in portrait mode on how the pictures look in portrait mode again
now this is an HD 720 just want to show you that it actually does render the video
the struggle that this processor has so no matter what video you try to look at it
that velocity micro chose this processor for their tablet this does not come with any of the
so that's a big plus on this but again this is just a summary for the full detailed review again
visit our website where you could get for the details and pull the testings that we have done so
let's look at the hardware a little bit so the nova has a flush front screen
it adds a micro sd card slot both have usb c ports and then on the back
the onyx is a little bit more tablet-like a little bit heavier with that glass screen
it also has a wacom touchscreen and comes with the stylus so it adds a lot more functionality
what i saw was even more interesting is the color is completely different on these two devices
we got to get back a couple of pages um so we get the same page here
has this color control in here where you can control the contrast and the color saturation
so and i'm not exactly sure what brightness does but when you combine it with color saturation it gets really
yeah you can definitely see how much brighter it is right now than it was by default
we'll talk about that a little bit more in a second but yeah i don't know it's just interesting
the refreshing algorithm isn't nearly as good pocketbook basically refreshes the full screen all the time
you got to have go in here and set it to do a deep refresh every page
there's hardly any ghosting like with the menus or anything like onyx always has ghosting when you close a menu
they do this on their system-wide like contrast control where like the text is a bit darker
here i also noticed the text looks darker on the onyx than it does on the pocketbook
i just wanted to show you the differences between these two devices kind of a quick comparison review
check out the main reviews if you'd like to see a little bit more in depth for these devices
your what's up guys inside our reviews and I'm today I'm going to be reviewing unboxing this tablet
I start here the main specs for this tablet that I will show later on on the video
okay so the screen size of the tablet is 10.1 inches the resolution is the IPS
it's a 64 intel quad core processor with a 1 gigabyte of RAM and 4 hours of battery life
ok so on the front we have the power and the volume buttons on the right side
automatically we also have the mercury SD card supports up to 64 gigabytes and the speakers on the back
I couldn't find the cameras information anywhere until I found it inside the camera settings the back camera was 1.9
this part right here is made of a plastic so this material does not grab the bottom of the tablet
basically at any time you want we also have the options to UM forward backwards and pan
pause the play and pause it worked on this fine but the forward and backwards options the functions
I will say a couple millimeters smaller than the normal size laptop keyboard using the trackpad
there'll be times where it will feel like the tablet will lag or slow down but for the most part
the battery life on this tablet will last four to five hours once fully charged playing this intense game
it's also got an optical processor now you can expand the storage if i just quickly actually
we've got a memory card slot so you can expand the memory on the top edge
also you have got a usbc charging port as you can see and then on the side here
we've also got volume up and down and the rest of the edges are pretty much clear
the speakers are pretty good on this one uh also of no is there is some texture on these sides
there's no face recognition or anything like that on this one but that's acceptable at this price
nice resolution pin sharp display now it mentions ips on the uh sort of spec sheet
but you do get some color shift when you're looking at it off angle but it's not too bad
of course i can see lots of you tuning in live we have got uh jeremiah jeremiah
we know people in texas and now i know you thank you very much for tuning in live
I want to show you down on as 56k tablet that I got for free to test it
this tablet is better than my previous one but there are little things that I would change
this giveaway is only available to the 26 au countries that have listed in the description box below

for supporting the channel by sending with tablets it was so much fun to use and
I'm approaching this review very much from an artist's point of view and the apps and the performance
this is not a sponsored video but they were kind enough to send me the tablet
and that's already installed on the tablet surface so a little bit about the technical characteristics
it has a front and a back camera it has 32 gigabytes of disk space and 2 gigabytes of RAM
I just turned it on and the tablet comes with all the Google Apps pre-installed so there was YouTube Google
I like to make several test pages when I first start using a new program or device
the pen comes with 1024 levels of pressure and I was really pleased with the variation I got
I'd be interested to see how long the batteries last so that's just really personal preference on my part
rêveur cable the performance of the pen was very good and I liked how light and small
so when you're drawing the screen won't recognize the side of your hand and make marks
I didn't have any trouble with this but I have seen a couple of other reviews on YouTube
it was certainly quicker to create a thumbnail and then to rub things out and to move things around
the tablet is so easy to use and to sketch and to rework things but I also do love
the company says that their target audience for this tablet is students and beginners to digital art
yes there's a little bit of lag it's small but there is a little bit and yes
testing out the tablet for a couple of weeks and it's been really useful for my workflow
I've been using it for sketching and I've also been using it for watching YouTube videos
we are checking out the latest affordable tablet from vast king called the kingpad k10 pro
as i said we have that done slot for the sd card on the left hand side
here we have the power button and the volume keys and the usbc charging port and the bottom
the tablet comes pre-installed with android 10 right out of the box and i was very happy to see that
the launcher looks very close to stock on android so nothing holding up the tablet back
i've seen other tablets in the past that have these strange launchers that are pretty heavy
but i don't think i would use this tablet for um call of duty that much
i mean this is not exactly a gaming device and even though you can do it
something that has a more powerful um processor and gpu but gaming is possible as well
with the tablet this will do great for facebook for watching videos for browsing the web
we're gonna be taking a look at a really inexpensive 2 in 1 laptop slash tablet from
I've never personally owned a laptop from this manufacturer it's either Evo or Evo but I'm gonna call it
I own a couple mini laptops with this chip and I think it's a great performer
we also have the keyboard attachment which makes this a two-in-one and it feels really heavy
it actually feels like this should have an extra battery in it but I don't believe it does
I simply pulled this apart and this is what was here from the factory in most assembly plants
Evo's so the screen on this thing really isn't that bad touch sensitivity and the image quality
Dead or Alive to get in the constant 60fps and this redream emulator works great on these end
Killzone liberation and Midnight Club double and finally for the emulation segment at least for this video
it's just not going to cut it for GameCube but in the past on other systems with this same chip
IO on the tablet itself and overall I've seen much better performance out of different machines with this same chip
you can play Minecraft with it but I don't see this lasting long especially seeing the issues
so if you're interested in seeing any of those videos let me know in the comments below
but it's kind of twitchy then my friends at Van Keogh sent me this and it's been a lifesaver now
plastic wrap off nice cardboard good and thick and here is the tablet comes in this nice little bag
32 gigabytes internal storage but it's expandable with an SD card up to another 32 gigs
it took a few minutes and a few more to install some apps and I was off before the lockdown
it's got a good battery life it charges with the USBC connector so be ready for that
I think the biggest con to this is the lack of accessories like case a screen
protector whenever you have a model that's not super popular like a Samsung or an Apple product
I kind of Miss having a physical home button something I can hit without having to look at it
the matrix pad s 20 is four-and-a-half DS quality product that's good at web surfing streaming and entertainment
we have the onyx books nova 3 color and on the right we have the ink pad color
shell form factor housing and overall design as the ink pad 3 which is a sunken screen and bezel
so it's not actually an exposed screen to the point where you're scratching the actual screen
now it doesn't exactly tell you what most of these are but we do know that it's saturation
this is what manga looks like as well it is very vibrant on both of these again
it actually shines into a layer of thick silicone gel that lays over the entire assembly
therefore the sunken screen does overall look a little bit better than having something over the screen be it glass
especially if you want to share this with seniors or kids and for someone like you
it's probably good to be more than adequate for web browsing emails watching movies and playing in 3d games
I personally use this tablet as an extra monitor when I'm filming with my mirrorless camera
i've reviewed my share of detachables two-in-ones like the surface pro 7 and of course the surface pro x
it was a two-in-one detachable that i really liked especially with that legendary thinkpad keyboard but they discontinued that line
you know i reviewed the x1 tablet the x12's predecessor and that was discontinued a couple of years ago
you also get the extension cord and i love the fact that the pen is included at no additional cost
and the kickstand allows you to have a pretty wide viewing angle going down as far as you see here
it is next to the thinkpad x1 nano i recently reviewed and as you can see
i'm gonna revisit the surface pro x as i picked it up for less than six hundred dollars
especially when you compare it to something like the surface type cover you get with the surface pro 7.
lte above that is a thunderbolt 4 port which is good to see and a 3.5 millimeter audio combo
uh i'm using the rear-facing camera on the x-12 detachable and as you can see let me just show you
i'd say that the rear facing camera which is an 8 megapixel cameras pretty good and again
excellent contrast and it has a low delta e score of 1.68 making this a color accurate display
42 watt hour battery which is a pretty good size for a two in one detachable
and the 65 watt usb-c power adapter included charges in about an hour and a half
that's the lower powered tiger lake processor and pretty decent performance considering how small and light this two in one
detachable is not too bad actually in terms of the numbers as you can see here
but you can get it with up to 16 gigabytes of ram which is non-upgradable meaning
and here's how it did on the reads and writes on the crystal disk mark test now
an even more enhanced experience use a pair of good bluetooth headphones or wired headphones for that matter okay
it does show some fingerprints but a lot better than other think pads with this black coating on it
so just keep that in mind but it's good nonetheless but i'm curious to know what you think
let me know in the comment section below so please hit the like button please subscribe
let me know if there's a device or something out there you think i should review
travel is good considering how thin the cover is but there's definitely some bounce to it when you're typing
one side of the screen are the power and volume buttons and a combo headphone mic
the tablet itself struck me as having quite solid build quality slightly better than the huion hs610
i do have two minor complaints off the bat and these held up throughout my testing
the pen tilt support which works as well as it does on my ipad pro and on the wacom tablets
i've tested you should be able to use it in any art program without any hassle
i like this tablet a lot and i'm sure in future products they'll continue to innovate and improve their design
thank you to xp pen for sending me this tablet to review and being patient with me
i do hope that i'll be able to bring some more xp pen reviews to you in the future
the design is the same so the only thing that differentiates the second generation from the first generation
and so this is the trackpad you can use these to move the cursor around the screen
you have to choose from this drop-down menu some of the woods are not translated properly
all rules actually work quite well so most of the track pack box have been solved with the second generation
the strokes they taper quite well sometimes there can be unnecessary erosion at the end of the stroke
it feels quite premium because of the metal back and smooth finishing right at the front and back
so this is a very good tablet forward drawing purposes the downside is when you draw very heavily
a major improvement of this tablet over the first generation would be the improvement to the trackpad
it now works quite well although with some software it's dude doesn't work for example earlier
you want to pan around the area you cannot if you want to rotate that feature has been removed which
actually because if it doesn't work well it's best to just remove the future rather than frustrate the user
I actually do not use the trackpad when I'm drawing because my other hand is always on the keyboard
I find out switching from the keyboard to using the trackpad and then switching back it's inconvenient
well occasionally my hand would actually brush against the surface and move the cursor accidentally so
the main selling point of this tablet will be the build quality and wireless feature speaking of wireless feature
I've had a chance to test even though this has less RAM than the Nexus 7
USB ports a little bit on that that's on the top but through the management of screen
but it's it doesn't really feel like it gets in the way too much and like
applications including this power saver application lets you choose between ultra power saving optimized or custom modes
there's a screen display color temperature and whitebalance kind of application here called splendid and a couple of other applications
let's go ahead and open up a few applications here you can see it does come with
I haven't really found anything that you can't run on this guy so I find chrome here
you can adjust the viewing angle and you're not gonna have any problems seeing so that works out nicely
let's go ahead and fire up a quick game here now with a 1280 by 800 pixel display
I think it looks pretty good and sounds pretty good that speaker even though again in landscape mode
I'm gonna be reviewing the like s 640 m tablet that was sent to me for review
alright so the tablet is quite tiny but could be perfect for outdoor use like outdoor painting
you can switch it either way you want doesn't matter it still looks the same which is really nice
nothing's unusual just not gonna make sure that you unplug your other tablet if you have one
it is quite impressive for such a little tablet as this and it it works nice
I like to click press very likely when I press someone that was with my friends
I'm going to finish it with this drawing those these funky looking spaceships that I did you know so enjoy
also be sure to stick around to the end as well for a very special announcement so enough chit chat
and ac type usb cable the quick start guide which i really need to use later on
this pen holder also serves as a storage for your nibs and can go as your nib
here are the two ports where you'll connect the provided cables from your tablet to your computer
if you haven't watched doro hedorah i highly recommend it and also the manga is really good
as the speed paint is playing on the background i'll be citing my thoughts about the product first impression
the surface of the tablet was like it was giving me the feel of like drawing on paper
i don't know the cable ports could have been designed to be in the left side of the tablet
absolutely i haven't encountered any issues after using it for about a couple of days and everything works and functions
this is why I actually could not really get a nice good secure fit with the pin charger
furthermore just talking about little minor touches this particular tablet comes with a cute little blue bear matching bear
but they're not all equally as dramatic as that once you get into about the $130 and you still get
you always had to deal with that whole division thing in juggling your device memory versus internal storage alright
oh one last thing it comes also with a net mat mesh net bag so yeah
go if you're not familiar with what that is it's a stripped-down version of android for really low-end hardware now
like i've just said but it does allow you to install pretty much all the android apps that you'll need
this tablet does enable you to install disney the disney app as well as netflix prime
this is the packaging box other than the name of the tablet and a company's name
USB type-c connector will go to the tablet this is the USB wall charger that features a double flat pin
here this is for holding the pen that is included for the price of the tablet
I'm going to ask the company and update information in my text review for us 200 dollars
this is a budget tablet at that pricing it's made for students or people with limited budgets beginners so
the screen protector is already pasted onto the screen and this is how reflective it is
you can use this for charging you can also use these to transfer files to your computer
so if you want to add more storage to your tablet you can do so the speaker on this tablet
so let's take a look at the specifications of this tablet so we have a gyroscope
the screen is 10.1 inch aspect ratio 16 by 9 this is an IPS screen so color
gigs you can expand that with microSD card the RAM included is 2 geeks so the overall specifications
those are the google apps and also the drawing app which is a sketchbook pro sketch
Pro is pre-installed but other than that there are no other apps included so this version of Android
it doesn't allow you to upgrade the Android OS so you have to stick with version 7.0
I'm going to draw some slow diagonal lines now at the camera and go that I'm pointing at
I mentioned that this is an active stylus so it supports pressure sensitivity and palm rejection
if you want palm rejection to work flawlessly the pen tip has to be really close to the screen
I can actually raise my palm on this surface which is higher compared to the screen
I'm lifting my palm away from the screen because I'm going to prevent the straight strokes
so pressure works but there is jitter when you are drawing very slowly and at the normal speed
those are straight strokes because of the palm rejection so that was the sketchbook app and now
Jeter but this is considered acceptable to me and when you draw a bit faster the lines will be smoother
sometimes there are jitter but not really a big deal so check out this lines here
I was resting my palm here and there is one straight stroke here which is not too bad
so overall drawing experience and performance really depends on the app that you use the pre-installed
Autodesk SketchBook it works fine but I prefer to use odd flow which is really great
I actually kind of like the price point at us $200 we have a very good pan
that drawing performance really comes down to the app that you use from the Google Play Store
I can't really fit the whole thing in camera but I'm doing it the best I can as always
they're meant to sit on the desk and not be mood whereas this one is thin
and it's nice that they included it with this tablet so this is the pen case
I want to point out about this tablet is that it has the command keys on the side
I say almost exactly is good that you can get for a fraction of the price
it's got a 8,192 levels of pen pressure sensitivity which is one of the highest if not the highest
it's it ten point six inches screen which is a large screen for almost around $500
so if you're interested please check that out also in my description as always are the links to my
I hope you guys have a beautiful day and I will see you in my next video bye bye you
let's just start so obviously you can see me pointing out all of the shiny stuff obviously
i guess so at first what i see are the requirements all this stuff and then what it contains now
it has a bunch of side t's ten actually and then the middle button so basically eleven
don't throw it out yet foreign so do so so do so foreign so bye balls family
well that's another case so this because this is quite thick unlike the previous model the goalie
it's on the back on the right hand side we have a 3.5 made audio jack
I haven't actually opened it to check it out but it sounds like has only one speaker
so if you're in a noisy environment you're not gonna hear what's happening on the tablet
so we have an 8 inch screen the resolution of 1280 by 800 so just over 720p
I was browsing a little so a bit of everything but it really depends from user to user
I have this set up like this at this time and then I tried it on having just one display
Windows 10 as I said before and this used to be an activated the copy of a Windows 10
so now if we click on home here you can basically see all the components out of the mini
this can probably tell it doesn't totally go the more like moving around so move back
I've seen for any mini PC that I throw when I try to make this full screen
I'm gonna skip forward a bit as I said if you don't move the mouse and you don't touch anything
but not the absolute best either so as I said not the absolute worst but not the best either
we are making on the best for gaming either however better than everything at least in hand until now
that's amazing maybe this will be fixed with some more future software updates but at this time
i recently got a brand new drawing tablet from xp pen and i'm here to review it
so when you're not using it you can just put it in there to rest it on the table
that you can program to do whatever you want in your drawing software and in the middle
it's also got over 8 000 levels of pressure sensitivity which makes drawing with this pen super smooth anyways guys
buttons brings a glove so that when drawing you do not scratch the screen with your hand
oh! gaomon also gives you a one year warranty in case you have a problem with a product
This is the first country that I draw with the tablet, believe it or not ... ready!
I don't know if I will either don't kill me ;-; this story has to do with my animation
I mean The one they sent me doesn't cost more than 65 USD with the discount
so, if to buy any of these beautiful tablets at a great price, links in the description
it were so beautiful that I didn't want to be the only one to see them
I actually really do like the the silver finish which has replaced the black edges on the color
mostly for children's books that allows you to record your voice and read back some of the text well
Barnes & Noble does have a good ecosystem of newspapers and magazines in its newsstand app
they don't have a great ecosystem when it comes to movies and videos and music unlike
so you've got a side loaded or you've got to rely on third-party applications like Netflix and Hulu
this is a graphic tablet in a compact size that you can plug into your laptop or computer
so you can have a screen to draw on and a pressure-sensitive pen before we dive in
it's a 11.6 inch tablet with a 256 point thirty two millimeter by 144 point 18
I've kept the tablet in its packaging bag just to lessen the glare on camera along with the tablet
when you're working can really help your hand to glide more easily across the screen so
you'll need to make sure that your computer has an HDMI slot free in order to connect the tablet then
I'm using going from light to hard to see the difference in the lines as you can see
I find a really useful when you're starting with a drawing tablet as you can practice
I found that whenever I do have a glitch with the pen on these sorts of tablets
then resetting the settings to default unplugging and turning on and off the screen tends to fix any issues
there were some design differences in the pen which I really liked and using a smaller tablet
I hope that this video was helpful if you were looking for information on this tablet
these are the extra nibs and the classic nip remover and we have manuals that's it
setup is it's a zip file um you need to download it first then install it
tablet and you can check the current prices amazon affiliate links are in the description below
I was on fire Kindle and it was this one here and I truly did not like it
it was extremely slow and was just really not up to the job of doing everyday normal things but now
which although maybe not full HD it still manages to provide a 1024 by 600 resolution
Wi-Fi connectivity and of course one of the best things about the new Amazon fire 7 tablets
but to be honest that is pretty much exactly the same as most operating systems out there have
itself don't get me wrong however this is not a major problem and in terms of general use
if you are one of them people who must watch something in the true HD 1080p formats
it can run games and of course allow you to watch movies and YouTube on the go
it may not be the best in quality up there but in regards to its price
i hope you all find this review interesting enlightening and it changes your life for the better
like last time i will be straying off the beaten path of typical unboxing / review videos
so here's the diagram provide in the user manual now that you have your tablet set up
once you've done this open it up and you'll find many different useful functions in the
a small amount of resistance allows for more control of your lines and simulates drawing on actual paper
I've never used a drawing tablet before that has this kind of resistance and it's very nice
I sure did now under the second portion of any review / unboxing video the unboxing
the dog was useless in opening the box so I enlisted the help of my female assistant
okay pause so apparently this cover on the screen of the tablet is supposed to be there and stay there
I'll start with the things that I'm not too fond of with this tablet first off my biggest complaint
just a clarification for some reason on the goemon website they try to market this tablet as portable
like you'll whip it out at the airport while you're waiting for your plane to arrive or something
this thing is far from convenient just because it needs to be connected to another computer to work
I can't express how much I like the slight amount of resistance between the pen and screen
there are plenty of shortcut keys the larger screen size at least compared to the tablet
i bought this tablet with my own money and wacom did not supply the tablet to me
it's smooth but not too smooth where your pen is struggling with how slippery the screen is
then come back and yes i could have changed the shortcuts but i liked the shortcuts
hey there today i just wanted to give a little bit of insight on how i make my animatics
you can have on mac or on windows or just on on linux as well as just like anything
this can be really useful to make sure the frames are consistent and moving at the right pace
this video isn't sponsored but the people at gammon very kindly sent me this you can see online
so if you check the description all the links will be there unboxing it origi you know initial thoughts
um i hope that if you were interested in making animatics this can help you out
i have the channel memberships now so if you want to support the channel then just click the join button
it's pretty easy and fluid to use and offers a lot of customization you get this
is the app tray and you scroll between the same using this and the next thing
this tablets puts the 10.1 inch screen and it supports a very good resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels
let me just open some websites to give you an idea if you open a new tab
you get a quite a few apps but again if you compare it with the native
let me click on this and you can actually normally type like this but this keyboard also supports
I'm going to quickly just start scrubbing the video and you can see that how quickly it performs
and there is no problem for the tablet to catch it up because of the powerful dual-core processor it has
I didn't do extensive testing but I've found the battery life to be also very good on this tablet
so you are stuck with the storage what you get on this tablet another con that
I did some Skype calls on this tablet and I didn't have any issues with that
there's also another version of this galaxy term known as Galaxy Tab 8.9 that's puts the 8.9 inches
taking a closer look at the tablet hardware itself its main casing is made of plastic that 10 inch ips
you will find both the volume up and down the power button as well as a headphone jack
the next thing i just want to talk about is what you get in the box with the tablet now
i've heard out there or tablets that i've tried in the past but it certainly isn't the worst
there is just a slight hollowness to the sound that i do find is noticeable audible
even when it is in front of you or plug in a set of headphones into the headphone jack
it costs 149 dollars in the us and about 140 pounds in the uk for that
i'd like to thank dragon touch for sending this one over to us to actually have a play with
I have a new email so we I will show to you how the swipe works
it's kind of hard to hit everything in the menu but yeah you can see it's smooth
Angry Birds and on the bottom here that was just for my test purposes actually real
it's fast its responsive and really really love this design and we actually even can play on an external display
you have here the compass which shows you in which direction this is actually a non
that's one of my colleagues and then you will see that it pops up automatically here with some emails
that's even nicer to do two-handed thumb writing or even just connecting your words by swiping
I see so Android is in favor of McDonald's but I don't care much as you can see here
but it's not that new you can use it with a Bluetooth keyboard so it's pretty nice
four two three display through a 16 to 9 displayed as of course some difference and in thickness
Wi-Fi if you are using it really hard right now and HDMI is connected but still
is this kind of is the magnesium vapor castings that Microsoft do and it truly is
it is beautiful it is very very well finished and you know just build quality wise it's impeccable
aside from that it was very very uh it was pretty good the a couple points
I did like was the accessibility to the micro SD slot which was located underneath the flap
it's much easier to click in and click ad on the surf the first iteration the surface
it's so it's not on par with the likes to some of Samsung's you know brighter option offerings
it required a little bit more force on the keys and it didn't always register this
it's quick it is actually you know it's it really is very good for lengthy typing no
It's the KAMVAS GT-221 Pro , and I am NOT an unboxing channel, so we're just gonna get into this
that's a good feature a stand for the back of the tablet power cables a USB.
Sixteen point seven million colors, I can't even count that many colors 8,192 levels of pressure
the display is good but it has a narrow viewing angle and can look washed out
there are no physical buttons for the volume which must be adjusted by using the on-screen controls
I think you should be pleased with the performance of the t-ten Plus thanks for watching
hey everybody its Luke over Galaxy tech review and today I've got a product from irulu
that might be my third con but beyond that those are the cons now as far as a pros go
so that's the one we're gonna reviewed it as let me get everything out of the boxer for you guys
and that's because of that half gig of ram but once things are loaded it runs really
you're good to go you know we'll just check out you know la beasty - cactus
load up but look the playback is is not bad at all so that is it's pretty cool
I mean the verticals that wash out a little bit but the you know the the side besides great
I do have a 1080p movie trailer on here on my external card and I want to show you
I mean actually pretty impressed with the price point that they put this out so anyway
it'll work for what you need to do with it that type of thing the rear facing camera
DX Pro X one you can pick it up on Amazon at the time of this video 438 99 go
please remember to like and subscribe if you have any questions or comments about this guy
this keyboard case is made of soft fabric and has two magnetic parts to keep the tablet closed in
interestingly you open the flap turn the back into a triangle and rest the tablet on it
there's also a trackpad and you can use two fingers to swipe up or down but it's really sensitive
this tablet is packed with a quad core Intel Atom processor with 2 gigs of ddr3
and fortunately there isn't much we're doing basic tasks like going onto the web or watching some videos
that was the least graphic and processor demanding on my list and it was pretty much unplayable
and don't keep the tablet fully secured and the tablet slipped out and almost fell on the ground
it's just so much more smaller and lighter to carry around and it gets the job done
there was only one time when the tablet died out on me and that was when
and this is the Archos 7 home tablet this runs Android 1.5 and given the name
power and lock over here micro SD card slot right here it has 8 gigs of built-in storage
also then we have the stippled metallic-looking back here which does flex you can hear it and see it
what's not so great is that it has a resistive touch screen and this is one insensitive touch screen
andreat app at several times and scrolling can be quite tedious also not so cool is this is just vanilla
there's no Pandora the stuff that is generally the most popular on the market unfortunately is not here
I've downloaded very few there is no YouTube player here either so a mobile YouTube player app
it's easier on the eyes certainly and right now it's working on loading the Google homepage
CPU and it's running on Wi-Fi and it seems like it could use some tweaks Wi-Fi reception isn't the strongest
if you go about 20 feet or more you will see the signal drop significantly right now
you can switch between classical pop heavy bass jazz and there is a custom so like all
Arcos devices it's a pretty good media player for music and for video in terms of other applications
and you get the settings here since there is no hardware button for settings on the main menu
there's no pinching zooming but this works pretty quickly and the photo frame functions kind of cool just prop
I understand and if you're keeping it plugged in it's a nice alternative use for the device
and that's we're gonna take a look at the e-book reader that's a nice interface again this this
if you want to read in portrait you have to use the software controls in the reader to navigate
it does have a large display but there are enough caveats here that I have a hard time recommending it
this is the innovator 16 from XP pen and I got to point out point out
that's not because of us but that's it's good to see all the little clown fish on this
let's take a look at the specs here and we're gonna unbox this unit and then
they said we're gonna send you a 24 inch we're gonna send you a 16 inch and the 24 inch
everyone is creative all right and we believe that we believe everybody can be common our teacher
it's probably gonna wind up purple and black alright so we're gonna go try this tablet out
I did a drawing of I was called her bubble jam but you think she should be called
Stevie if you watched for long enough or clownfish is named bubbly Steve by me and Triscuit
Steve so like it's an anime girl so she should be Stevie Stevie okay well we can call her
but the innovator 16 is actually thinner than the Wacom tablet which kind of blows my mind
I mean this is the thickness of an iPad know how to put some earrings on them
I mean obviously it turns on your computer but no jitter works beautifully in clip studio and in Photoshop
I think it does yeah so I'm going to go over some tech specs here for those of you
it's it's really a nice cross between a desktop unit and a portable unit again that feels very right-sized personally
here are some of the tech specs for it for those of you who are interested in the tablet
we're gonna unbox it and try it out on my computer just like with my other reviews
I know I just want to open this nicely without having to remove the other sticker
Wow okay I just love opening little boxes so and it tells you what's in it
here's your stuff but this is like here's your stuff your highness and I'm like oh my god
yeah okay let's put that okay so next we have this um this is all the cords and stuff correct
I really like this tablet and I'm not just saying that I actually like I can't believe this
the texture is so nice like the texture of the tablet is not too smooth and not too rough
Wacom I would have some kind of disconnect where I have to take some time to get used to it
like what is going on and the size is really nice like I just felt really comfortable
it was really small and it would kind of hurt my wrist because I would have to keep moving around
I did not show myself drawing in the corner like I usually do like you know with the actual tablet
I only had one problem with it and that was just my laptop being a but but um yeah
so if you guys are kind of confused as to whether or not you should get it
I definitely say just try it out for yourself and see if it works for you
criticisms in my right guys alright thanks for watching and I'll see you in my next video
i was looking for a good large tablet at a good price and i think i may have found it
we have a really nice case and it's got a bead blasted look and obviously black
but i tell you what this is going to be my companion on my next trip
i don't know if we would use the term retina display but at 1920 pixels on the long edge man
they are absolutely outstanding in terms of representation and one of the things that i have noticed here
the pablo co 16 a great little host power drawing tablet for all of you right-handed artists out there
so here's a quick draw test that I did quite early on while testing out this tablet
this is actually a lot of fun and I got to grips with the tablet quite early on
now this stylus it doesn't have rotation as with the more expensive tablets but it is very accurate
you can see the ports there which we'll get another look at right here so moving on here
I'm seeing quite a lot from tablets that I've reviewed in the past couple of weeks
CD with drives on but you can go and download the drivers which I certainly did
I personally use my own artist glove but here we go just to show you that our glove in use
you've got a couple of millimeters there but I think that's forgivable especially on such an affordable tablet
I think the same as I do of a lot of these tablets too had a soft rubber nib
that would be awesome and that initial pressure would be absolutely fine but pen pressure wise
I think I'm going to work up to a finished piece for a little host powered 16 inch drawing tablet
you can see the difference between the video and the screen capture out of the box
that's just the way it is so it's up to you which way you want to go
I'm actually managing to do quite a bit of work that I'm quite happy with by this stage
we have just a regular laptop allows you to work like that and that's kind of cool
I close everything else down apart from my email and my web browser everything else gets closed when I'm video
editing only premiere is open why because it slows down your computer up a lot even though
I know it's cheesy but I think with a little more work could I do that
I think it's easier to move over to a larger drawing tablet and do it quicker
sit around in the studio sit around and electric via put the tablet on top of the keyboard
Wacom I will never ever get another huion tablet again as long as I live like
it's not worth it like all that hassle when you paid all that money is not worth it
this one's model is called gaomon pd1161 a small display tablet about 10 by 6 inches
it's a pretty small boy and lucky for gauma and i'm a huge sucker for small display
you'd have your usual accessories for a tablet which is the pen pen holder connectors adapter manual and artist glove
especially if they don't know how display tablets are usually arranged as just a thought double bond
then you'd need to manually set it up on your computer with a few clicks and then there you go
so i know you guys use phones and stuff but yeah this is a heads up anyway
and you'd know why if you've come this far and actually listened to the whole video anyway
and maybe i'd continue my current workload with it for school commissions with pmvs and what what not anyway
of course this one is definitely a little bit bigger and as we've already seen this super cute pencil pouch
oh and this is nice comes a little thing to clean your uh screen which will be good
the other thing with this is it also has a container for the pen if i can get it out
i think this is a great starting point so something to kind of introduce you to this
these drawing tablets is that you just install the drivers from the xp pen website it's very straightforward
because i'm sure there is going to be different preferences for people but that's just a very small detail
i'm sure that you can get a other stands for your tablet if you really want to and then here
i really really like the dial the wheel on the side to be able to zoom in and out
i put where i found that the buttons are handy as well and here you can see
uh that is available to you on your computer like illustrator and indesign and those kind in photoshop
these are programs that i don't actually use on my ipad because i'm worried about you
because i hate having to wait for x y and z to charge and so another thing about that is
the top was the display gamut so so basically what this means display gamut is how much of the like
let's get it out of here so I can get this big box out of the way
I realized that but yes my MacBook only has USB sea ports so I had to buy the adapter again
what's the term pixel density as far as like the number of pixels per inch or per centimeter or whatever
I will try to do that calculation and put it in the video when I'm editing
this just seems to be the place where it's most obvious but for the price right now
I'm actually impressed with this with this thing because honestly you can't expect a you know
I could see the difference in the visible gamut like the visible colors that this can duplicate
I've noticed it with some pages more than others and I'll show you guys what I did on
spider-man was like the red was coming out more saturated than it did on my macbook or my desktop
I'm having to stop myself from doing gestures on the screen because again I'm Way too
used to procreate right now but so far so good and let's just keep coloring all right so
I'm like I said I I honestly didn't have high hopes and to clarify something here
oh you have to say this you have to say that you know none of that
I it doesn't feel cheap though as far as the the build quality is very solid
because if you want to draw on your screen and it really does make a big difference
i showed earlier where some of the colors looked a little bit more or less saturated but i
I don't know if it's a big enough problem for me to say like you know
it's subtle and if you're not used to it you would probably not even think it's an issue but again
I'm coming from you know really dense high pixel density screens so it seemed really obvious to me
it might just be a translation issue but on the website it says it supports 4k
so when it says supports 4k keep that in mind it is not a 4k monitor
the only thing about the pin that it took me a while to figure out was
I guess and it took me forever to figure out what I was doing because I knew it wasn't
okay the other thing is if you work on you know like high resolution you know
I'm not getting paid for it if you buy based on the link in the description
8 one tablet with companion keyboard dock that runs a full version of the OS and comes with Microsoft Office
the transformer book t100 ta offers very respectable performance especially for its modest price tag here
we are running the 3d mark ice norm benchmark and the T 100 ta puts up scores
I'm Dave alte villa here with the Asus Transformer book t100 ta thanks again for stopping by
i just call it artist club because i'm an artist myself and would you look at that
then we have the cleaning cloth to clean the tablet obviously and there is the quick start guide
then there is the cable so that we can connect the tablet to the computer or our android devices
so that whenever you're working it'll just stay in place and that's all that's in the box
i'm gonna leave her channel link in the description box below if you want to check her out
my thoughts about this tablet is pretty good pressure sensitivity feels like it has 8192 levels of pen pressure
one shortcut key isn't customizable though because it's for the lights but again not big of a deal for me
the pen is pretty responsive the work area is just right not too small not too big
it's pretty easy and totally natural but after sketching you still to scan your artwork into Photoshop
it's always been kind of clunky so we'll give that a three now speed kills and the
typically you're going to pay about $50 depending on which direction you go for a really great
what do you think is the most valuable is a tablet even worth it or do you find that
that always helps a lot and is a super cool way that you can help out this video
okay let's put all these stuff away and let's take a closer look at this drawing tablet
it's a half a glove and it goes on your ring and pinky finger and what it does
they're trying to stay out of things as much as possible when it comes to design
Snapdragon 801 chipset running the show in there it does also come with three gigabytes of RAM
I've tried a few other games with this as well and the performance has been pretty consistent across the board
this is one of the fastest tablets that you're going to find out there on the market right now
so it's no surprise that they've loaded up with the z2 tablet with a full complement of multimedia applications right
Play Store but this is preloaded and it does give you quick access to Sony's unlimited streaming service
they've just about nailed it if you're on the market for a 10.1 inch Android tablet
it is one of the best out there right now and that is a fact the Xperia z2 from Sony
that came out last year and also to the Xperia Z before that but looks can be
so you're gonna have a fairly recent edition of Android or Android 10 currently but this says Android 9
we go get some gaming on with the asphalt 9 just to show you it runs
I said it's fairly decent in terms of dislike using it and going through the menus and just overall usage
Android 9 is on here about the tablet 2 gigs around max 10 android 9 but
show you around the tablet a little bit later in the video but the speakers are awful
they're just they're bad they're awful and just give you a quick little peek around this tablet
you do have a camera on the front as well at the top in the middle
I just wanted to do a speed test on the Wi-Fi with my Galaxy Note 10.1
I got a score single core of 716 and a multi core of 25 at 71
hey guys there you go an awful school or 145 them a single core 626 on multi scores
so if you're gonna use this for like Netflix or like YouTube or like stuff like that
I said earlier when when you don't install any apps on this you get about 25 gigs of free storage
so you won't be able to do a fingerprint on here the if you go into
so you can do that if you turn that on and you double press the power button
if there's a system update you can come in here and check to see if there's one
Chrome for you just so I can shake and you can see that a load up the Samsung website
what i'll do is i'll go over various features and accessories that comes with the original product and then
wakeham it does incorporate a few things provided accessories you do get about a three meter micro
they do have led labels across each side that are you can pre-program or pre label into whatever you want
it does come with standard pre-programmed values does have this scroll wheel as well as a middle
you just kind of move it unlatch it and then there's the battery component there in order to get replacements
let's dive right into the next segment and kind of show you how it performs inside applications
so let's say this is just as you go darker where you press a little bit harder
you can get a very faint line for sketching or any kind of detail or as you press harder
absolute ton of wireless equipment in my room and still perform performing without any types of issues right
nibs that kind of leads me to the first issue that I kind of had with the 10 tablet
how heavy heavy handed you are you do go through nibs faster than I would think right
I I do tend to write or press down a lot harder than I probably should
you won't find that unless you're really far away from the source device that you're connecting it to
i have the link in the description but i believe it was an 18-hour specified battery life
you have to get a replacement battery so be careful with that when you use this
I find this a little bit more comfortable and ergonomic to use this versus my mouse
i don't want to destroy the box because if i don't like this it doesn't suit my needs
read the description if you go over to amazon and take a look at this thing okay
that have already got this and said that they didn't like the ghosting box is fine
we're going to take a look at it but let's look at the accessories in the box
let's bring this back over and just to make a comparison just so you can see the size
you can kind of see the coloring in the different areas i did not put a screen protector on here
i've heard it's been pretty dark and that is an issue that i'm seeing a little bit
now let's get into the notes so the notes i've been playing with it a little bit
it's a little bit glassy and i think if we end up with the screen protector
i'm not going to take thick notes right so i don't know if i really need the coloring
this is the device so i personally do not like the riding experience and then you can see it ghost
it's ghosting that okay and i think what does that do does that take it back to
i i think this is a little too small anyways to be my primary note taker
version of tablet we've looked at the Lenovo IdeaPad k1 which is their consumer oriented one
you're going to like solid build quality and that traditional think pad soft touch finish with the logo
and here we've got the optional pin though it has a built-in silo for the pen
but they're not that easy to press accidentally but I don't see a need for them
but there's no chip inside actually to make use of that this is your full-size SD card slot over here
next to it and we have a micro USB port HDMI ports a mini HDMI port
there's no problem getting enough power to it but it actually did not mount it and see it bummer
because there's many options if you hit watch defaults to em spot video service it also 18
yes and it's going to put those at the root level of the internal storage area speaking of all things
USB if you plug this in using the micro USB cable to your computer it will charge
but it's there as some kind of fallback that's nice if you don't have your handy dandy charger with you
but we hope it's coming and your Apple enter is the standard Google honeycomb look here found our apps here
sometimes no probably going to want to use something like Aldi CO or cool reader or
Universal in reliable as I mentioned we've got Zinio onboard as well and a copy of the user guide
you can see the usual display of continued watching stuff of interest and we're going to resume a video
typical of Netflix is going to buffer up a little bit and then it's going to play shortly
Wi-Fi since that's all we have looking good so you got Netflix on the go with this
so this is no lightweight this is no iPad 2 or Samsung Galaxy 10.1 and hand-making
I mean that's not so different from the EPI transformer which is 1.5 pounds or the Motorola Xoom
there's a bit more taper going on with the IdeaPad and it's got that kind of gritty
which has as you can see it even brighter display it also has much better speakers
and if you want to create a new document you just hit the plus button down here and choose between
so we're going to take a look at some of your editing options here and you can see
select select all copy paste undo redo that kind of stuff so a fairly basic interface
it has those ridges typical of the field folio cases and you can choose which incline you want
that's on here or if it's a little bit slow to respond the HEC Jetstream also uses the entering
so if you're looking for YouTube content that's also a very good way to play YouTube stuff
this is a more secure and vetted place and since this is geared towards corporate users
you know there's a place you can go where the applications have been checked out no
but then there's enough here to look at and keep you busy for those of you
and this is the font that it uses after his recognised stuff and you can see
it does erase and another function this one just functions to activate erase if you press and hold it
this runs full window so you can run old applications all the way back to the 90s even DOS
apps can run with software that you can find that will allow you compatibility like DOS blog
they will run all and tell me right there on the box and tell inside never thought
i didn't forget about the cleaning cloth i'm gonna keep it here all right the sand
okay so this one is different than the stand i had for the last one i mean
what i like what i don't like as much and some of the specification to help you
if you are looking for a new drawing tablet as i know some of you are okay here
which is anti-glare giving it this realistic pen on paper experience when you draw on it
mind if you like to use the eraser a lot on your tablet pen i like the nib a lot
but this one keeps the tablet sturdy no matter how high or low of an angle you walk on now
the tablet is compatible with and while adobe animate isn't mentioned i can already testify that it works as well
since this tablet came with a graph that actually fits me for the first time in my life
i've ever owned yes even my 12 year old wacom intuos one which is a drawing tablet not a screen
because it's only there to mock you if you do want this tablet but like shortcut buttons
you can try and bypass this issue by having one of the pen buttons be the shortcut button instead
the pressure levels on the pen didn't seem to show on the menu despite having the drivers installed
but what's even weirder is that the pen worked fine in photoshop and i wouldn't have known about it
the huion canvas 22 plus is a very decent tablet aside from the absence of shortcut buttons
that doesn't require any battery and spots pressure sensitivity up to slightly over a thousand levels
so it doesn't require any charging there are is no you razor at the back overall
this allows you find a control over the pressure curve and you can test a pen pressure
you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts by just pressing the keys or you can choose one of this
I don't have issues with the other apps black clip studio paint MIDI Bang affinity Krita
SX because this already comes with a pressure sensitivity stylus so you can already draw directly on this tablet
I have both tablets in vertical portrait orientation so the active area is still the whole surface on
the build quality is solid and the drawing performance is fantastic on both Mac and Windows
that's not a problem of this tablet because I have tested a lot of graphic tablets and pen displays
that has black so we need outside of this tablet is when you are working with
this video is sponsored by xp pen who are having their 15th anniversary right now to celebrate
they're having a discount of 30 off all of the products on their webstore until september 15th
the first type of tablet i ever used was a tablet without a screen that basically just means that
you can get really comfortable with them and leave them in your lap and i like that
they come in a lot of different sizes whereas screen tablets tend to be on the larger side
now this works as a second monitor on your computer and you draw directly onto the screen
there's a setting for that in the this little menu so if you want to use it vertically
do not and making sure that it's at a bit of an angle off your desk
i'd recommend when you get your tablet is to try and look up some information on how to clean it
sometimes people use like window cleaner on their screen tablets and that's generally not considered a very good idea
it's all like scratched up and uh that also can happen when you don't change your nib enough
i was impressed with the fact that it came with a stand and a smudge guard
you don't want to run out of nibs and because these are the anniversary edition for xp pen's 15th anniversary
and i'm going to try to answer as many as i can when this video releases
fable tell me lovely angel phil q musgrove trace nicole ludwack nicolette queen roone raincrow rainwater pearls ice cream pal
that's the power button and on the left side it has the perm the volume buttons
okay if he's a constant news if he's a now in the news you could lost at least two days
okay so they gives you some touch distance stuff like that he has of a few aces customizing
it also has screens your backup settings if you go on about it shows you 7.0
but actually it says ed 3:01 am best actual one okay so if you are interested in one of these
i'm making another tablet review video all right now that i have thoroughly pissed several of you off
uh xp pen has recently gotten in contact with me asking me to review the new innovator 16.
so the innovator 16 is a 15.6 inch tablet so it's a medium sized one and inside the box
we got the three in one adapter connector as well as several power connectors in case
the other way causes the wires to go right onto the desk which well that works
it would probably be fine but it could lead to a little bit of messy wire management
this is right at 92 adobe rgb with an 88 ntsc and 125 srgb in layman's terms
i'd probably give it a 4.5 out of 5 which coincidentally brings its total average score to 4.5 in total
it doesn't take a long time to load apps like that one did the only thing
so you had to pay five bucks for a week or 30 bucks for the year which
so is there any more expensive tablet and yet to pay for the apps versus the PBS apps
Verizon it's an LTE honeycomb tablet that measures 8.2 inch of the kind of unique size
we're gonna take a look at it now so this is the Motorola Zhai board 8.2
if we take a look at the sides you can see if got a rubbery coating here feels durable
USB port your micro HDMI port and this is where your SIM card slot is right here
here we've got the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and this is the IR blaster port because just like the 10.1
together you can see the size difference so kind of a just right size if you're
anything like that you know it has the 8.2 inch display running at 1280 by 800 resolution
say on your settings menu is going to be a little bit teeny err but it's still viewable
Ice Cream Sandwich and for tablets right now and even some smart phones like the Galaxy
we get heat dissipation issues as well as power issues there and speaking of casing size and battery capacity
and we're seeing it run between five and six hours on a charge and that depends whether using
no skip ahead to some a little bit more exciting so I was playing just fine off the flash drive
I don't want to play 1080p to the internal display because it doesn't support that resolution
8.2 does pretty relic is a 2822 on quadrant 56 on lynn packs multi thread test
we saw more like 22 or so for download speeds and about 6 up when we had say negative 85
has they have zoom to and the zoom to Home Media Edition for the smaller guy
you get the idea in terms of what's different between this and the zai board 10.1
if you're having trouble deciding if you're not set on this more compact size obviously mentioned the sideboard
so if you're looking forward to note-taking drawing that kind of stuff you want the 10.1
you have two options and fortunately doesn't use the standard USB mass-storage or Android file transfer Macs
I think the Moto Kass USB is a better option especially for those of you want to sync with iTunes
but hey you can use your finger and draw or capacitive stylus too for that kind of thing
Verizon's account manager and Verizon's video service sling box is also loaded on here and for office
board has dual cameras as a 1.3 megapixel camera on the front works with Skype and Google
that's actually takes pretty capable photos and decent video - definitely a step up from the original assumes camera
if you're trying to decide between the two and the size either one is going to work for you
I I didn't it's not even like Christmas it's like December like 10th or something on Christmas
but also for you know a free new kick-ass tablet so uh in other words we sponsored boys
when you open the package you'll see it comes with extra nibs along with the tablet itself
really cool the directions was links to drivers to download and a neat little carrying case that
Wacom Intuos the nibs were in the tablet but I like this much much more now
you can map on the settings for the tablet for instance my left is undo in
I have the black one which they would have to be the red one but you know
I haven't done a self-portrait in a hot minute so forgive me that it's that is so simple
now the case is designed in a way where it's very thick even you can see the corners of it
it's very thick that's designed because when they when the tablets in in there and the kids drop it
it also takes a micro sd memory card and the charging port is here on this side
so i've switched here on so i can show you some some features that he has built in mainly kids
so it does have a lot of pre-installed kids apps so when you have started up
so i can show you how much memory it still has built in now without going
for example draw it has draw built in and then you've got uh that's another kids app
i'm gonna just skip to the storage now without downloading any apps because of the pre-installed apps
so our 16 gig five gig is already used up so 30 of it is used up
it's a tablet that um operates quite um quite slowly and it can be quite frustrating
also it has the opera android 10 operating system 2 gig ram and 16 gig internal memory
so that's everything it has built in but for the price range i would say is worth it
it has two programmable buttons but no eraser and it basically just works as a travel tablet
there's a little loop on the side to hold your pen and it has electric green accents
that looked like they haven't been used much at all and those were going for around $200 in general
the design gets a 5 out of 5 because of all the buttons the touch wheel
my first impression of it was that it's very light and it has this very nice color on the back
which basically means you don't have to have it plugged into your computer at all times
it'll allow you to get a lot more comfortable and not have to worry about getting tangled in wires
this tablet cost $200 which i think is a very good value of five out of five for sure
because it's wireless so that gets a 5 out of 5 next up is the Wacom Cintiq pro now
I had a lot of fun on peeling the plastic off of all these little cords
there are non screen tablets and then there are these types of tablets which are stand-alone basically
its an asymmetrical design which means you have to flip it with the camera upside down
if you are lefty it runs its fans at full speed almost all the time which can be quite noisy
you'll probably just stop drawing on it really quickly so if you have any questions that you think
Holly poo poo ik Rachel Singh Rosie warlock sergeant pendulum the artsy musio boy se Dixit and Zooey Stardust
it's got an excellent screen and number you know for a budget tablet and number three
you do a lot of video chatting though the front facing camera is I believe it is a point
I do remember that much another viewer and also commented and said that I they must
I realize that but to answer that our to respond to that viewers respond of their comment
it is a popper it's called dots and I don't know if you're familiar with it
it don't matter when it comes to any one of these devices whether it be smartphones tablets computers
also the live wallpaper would go back to the factory stock wallpaper and also I use SwiftKey
I'm using I had another viewer also asked how do you change the boot animation on this device
so that's that's a good thing guys girls guys and I'll see if I can get in
well the customer representative had sent back an email to me saying that they had no future
this device is great for that and I personally say I don't think you can go wrong
buying this device guys to spend another tech tip video brought you another tech tip guy
and today i'm going to be sharing my review of the amazon fire hd 8 kids edition tablet
but i sort of wanted to broaden their horizons with like more of a more of a grown-ups tablet
friday sales amazon does discount its tablets throughout the year but on the whole like the retail price
so when you first get your amazon kids tablet you set up a profile for your child
and because you've set your child's age amazon is only showing your child within this app
the stuff that is appropriate so what it means is when your child turns on the tablet in their profile
this tablet is that they've got access to a range of things that sort of makes them think like
i don't have to worry about that kind of thing just yet um but you know that
who's a teen and on the cusp of like maybe you're happy to give them some freedoms on the tablet
i can navigate to bella's profile there and i know that that's all she can do
it all comes under this kids plus app so you get one year free with an amazon kids fire tablet
they can look at educational content if they want to books movies and tv websites web videos which the kids
they really got the hang of it very very fast so i was impressed by that
it doesn't just provide like cushioning all around the tablet because you know how kids can be with their stuff
um it also makes it super easy to grip so there's a bit of texture to this
and she's got quite diddy hands but she has no problem with picking this up carrying it around
it doesn't take too long and i would say that the battery lasts for around about 10 hours
but when your child is literally tapping on everything and downloading everything they see shiny object syndrome
post review of this tablet which i'll link in the description below and you can get more details there
obviously we don't want our children to just be zombies on their tablets all day long staring at a screen
maybe I mean I could try it but it's not as good as I say like a third party
but even if you want to install some apps so there's some mobile friendly games from the Microsoft Store
the lack of any onboard storage makes it really hard to download your favorite mobile titles like asphalt 8
I do give it props referent though as I will give this a solid 5 out of 10
this device feels a bit slow but when I go offline and I play these games right here
it's a bit clunky to get into but there's an SD slot and the USB OTG slot
which only does that the you can't connect it to a PC and it doesn't charge the tablet very it
I guess that's useful but considering the SD card support is for up to 256 gig
snap and easy wake up which are unless you route it you can't uninstall those off the go book
wakeup however is quite good because you can double tap on the screen to a kill a lie lap
the processor is a for those who want to know immediate ech quad-core processor the model number being mtk mt6589
it's a fairly light tablet considering its size or I think is the back of it
Adobe speaker bar up here so there's the two speakers one on the Left I want to write
I have headphones plugged in or something it would mess up with the volume like when you unplug it
on and off at certain times you got the screencast feature with Android 5.0 5.0 here
I kind of like it actually but it does get kind of weird at times it is experimental it notes
you can view them in one orientation or the other with sunglasses on either way you view this one
it's just a spirally weird color so it's not very outdoor friendly that's for sure and like all
I'm not a big big video game person but I have played a few video games on here
just for the simple fact it has a few extra features like hyperlinks work and stuff
so I got this for $30 off I have it sitting right now on a stand
you should be able to see these it came with this and a stylus pen which
I want to given that to a friend of mine but now let's get back to the tablet itself
it has a mtk mt6589 tablets but more than enough to play some games and watch
with a tablet 16 gigabytes of built-in memory does have an SD card slot which I will show you
because especially running the android 5.1 lollipop one gigabyte of ram does 10 would normally 10 a struggle
P range up here explains it has a rear 5 megapixel and a front 2 megapixel camera
because it's extremely grainy and you got a lot of noise in the photo once again
so it's definitely got all the goodies that in modern tablets should now as for accessories
it's not like those cheaper tablets where you got to push and hold it for it to actually scroll properly
it's kind of hard to do this one-handed but we'll get there as you can see
I'll go ahead and play a YouTube video for you guys real quick just to show you it
does in fact have a nice smooth fluid playback and as you can see it's not struggling at all
it's actually it actually reads as a cortex arm a53 processor again running at one point three gigahertz right now
it is indeed a 1280 by 800 pixel or a screen resolution on here it's got 212
nothing on the left side and pretty much nothing on the bottom going to the back
I've been asked by people my impressions and thoughts on here on tablets and up until now
the setup experience was really easy the stand came separate and not attached to the tablet which
it came with the stand attached which is a really comfortable and easy to use sort of trigger mechanism
but as someone who requires and depends on the use of a digital tablet every day
that's nice is even when not in use with pen in hand and painting program open
Wi-Fi and they all play pretty good but of course you know it takes a couple of minutes
this is the game that it came with and this is perfect to you for some somebody under two
I haven't really checked out all of these in here but you know ask you nicely okay
or if you're on a you know gonna go on a long road trip and you just want
I don't really care um but yeah I mean I think this is great for you
I would have rather have spent maybe 25 30 bucks on this but it seems pretty pretty durable
she does kind of like to pick at these so these are probably the first to go eventually
life shouldn't be that much of a problem as i had stated before it runs on android 10.0
i have the sound off just for copyright concerns and you can see the performance of it really
honestly it's it's gonna be second nature all around to you but like i said the performance is quite good
and here is a video from the rear camera recorded at the maximum resolution it supports also 720p
that's really better suited to cell phones and things like that but it's here it works
and that's really all you can ask for so all around the voguer prior pad x 100 10.1
there are some tablets that you pick up and they just feel like a piece of junk
they're going to be running the same android software and they're probably going to have similar specifications
all around you've seen the quality of video you've seen the quality for games so all around
it's a great deal from voguer the prior pad x100 10.1 inch tablet if you'd like to purchase this item
i'll leave a link in the video description where you can find it available for sale on amazon
LCD display so very nice there as well additionally it has dual front-facing speakers for stereo
which kind of keeps them from going places where you might not want them to in child mode
they're all pre-loaded on this thing and your child can read along with them and enjoy the different stories
they're not long or extended or anything like that but there are some pretty neat stories for example
there's just so much going on with it so that would probably make for a bit
this is the genius in 912 a graphics tablet or pin tablet as they call it um as you know
we are going to draw so as you can see by my ugly drawings and scribbles and writing there it's
I'm really not and I hate to say this because I like to find good things about everything
I hate like not liking things because everything's awesome in its own way but I don't like this tablet
I like to do nice loose long strokes and I can't do that at this title
I feel like I'm captain like do this to get any like good lines out of it
I know they're more expensive but you can either even get it like a smaller model
I would rather have like a small Wacom Bamboo create or touch the really small one
they have got a z7 10 and all are available with the high specs as well
you are getting one customer survey card if you're happy with the product or not share with the manufacturer
7-inch lcd display android tablet with 3000 milliampere hour battery which will last for at least seven to eight hours
which will help you to navigate files from internal memory of tablet straight into the sd card
you need to plug in earphones kind of pretty much straightforward applications are available in here
this tablet will be used by kids and performance of playing video game over the tablet
you can see that how quite nice they are pretty defined actually to be honest with you
having a google play store you can actually install disney application netflix applications or stuff like
now as i have mentioned before within the specification the tablet comes with a built-in gps
or if your little ones who are under 10 now that would be completely all guys
if you think i missed anything please let me know in the comment section down below
the first is the unboxing we can see how it's packed in what comes with the bus
Jazza and if you use that on huion comm or on your appropriate country amazon website
you can get this device for 5% off and that is on top of standing discounts
open it up with you giant very sharp sword turnout to hold the blade oh good
I suppose for mounting you kidding me this comes with a smudge guard that I did not expect
are the new touch strips and shortcut keys so this is going to be fun to play around with
it is quite big but it's quite light as well and take it with you tube
the rest of this stuff is reasonably unexcited and self-explanatory we have various cables and plugs
I was actually genuinely really excited that they had my jazz a coupon code on display on the website
it is a really nice little touch before you jump into the art creation with the tablet
Mouse drag and all of that stuff and then of course you have the shortcut keys
and the sliders on the sides of this tablet beyond that there's also the pressure sensitivity which
of course were the nice little carrying case and extra nibs the sexy smudge guard which
the first is the lack of a double click function in the quick click button thingies
bonus is the addition of the touch strip and the shortcut keys now again being completely upfront
I had set it up and established my workflow there was just an unbridled flow of creativity on the device
I guess what I'm trying to say is the cake that you get in this device
but don't want to feel like they're making compromise by having to purchase a expensive smaller tablet
it does not come installed you have to install it yourself but here's how it looks
i really like it um i must say it's one of my first time using one of these tablets
share and subscribe so youtube would recommend this to other people who are interested in um giant tablets
um to the tablet but rather the computer itself so just keep that in mind okay so otherwise
it's a very useful and you know a nice minimal setup for the digital artists out there
my mom is vacuuming but today we're going to be reviewing the um what is it called again
I'm going to review this graphics tablet that was sent over to me by this company called
this is the USB charging cable for the pen so the pen users battery it needs to be charged
it has a nice weight it feels a bit plasticky but overall the build quality is quite quite solid
it's actually a bit smoother compared to welcome all who yawn tablets on this side of the tablet
I feel that it's a bit loose so be careful not to let your hand fall out
I'm going to show you what you can do with the driver with the driver you can assign specific
just click on the soft keys and you can do the same thing with the shortcuts in this
I mean a sign you can assign functions to the buttons on the pen as well
I cannot draw the second stroke and after a while it starts working again but it stops working again
I move the palette around it snaps back into place this is MIDI Bank paint Pro
I would just like to thank all of you who have come and subscribed to my videos
that is an amazing milestone so far so I want to thank you all very much
I would like to thank RT shol'va as they were kind enough to send this to me
I'll come back here and then we can basically go on to a few more steps
well sorry inside the bag you also get a little cleaner for the screen and a little startup guide
where if you were to view the pen against the screen at a sharp enough angle
this is a great little tablet and its size is really nice as I said so
I think should ever deter you from buying this tablet but anyway don't just take my opinion for it
if you'd like to pick this thing up you can use my link it'll be a Amazon link
there's lots of new things in the catalog so one of the things that we've got that
today is the tracing light pad so it's in this beautiful box here and I thought we'd go through it
okay so when you get the light pad out of the box it will be wrapped up nice and secure
I'm not sure if the if the designs coming up there but there is a little design there
but they're doing quite good drawing and then you want to make a birthday card so this is just one
so what you're wanting to do is when you say you've people say we pick this one
today is look at your point and place that point in the point in the center
then you pick up your blank piece of paper and place it over the top once
so that's one way to use the light pad to make a mandala the other way to do it is
is that no matter the thickness of your paper there is going to be a whoops
I'm just turn that off going to be a brightness that suit so this is actually 350 GSM watercolor paper
that's great so what I'm going to do is still use my mandala piece because it's got the circle
were going to use the backing of the light to add stars and create depth and interest
and there's a little patch in there so you can slide all your drawings in there and keep it safe
so there's some things like stencils and sticker paper and all sorts of stuff so very exciting stuff
yeah but that's it and thank you for joining me for some drawing you all right
but it's still better than most of the tablets out there in the market and the screen is extremely responsive
I also downloaded adobe flash to this particular tablet you could still do it on the Internet
just use an older version of the flash player and the puffin web browser actually works with the flash
I've done it on two different locations now with no issues and I have different browsers on here
I've loaded a lot of apps on your haven't had a problem with any apps not running again
so it's got the camera you your one of most people carrying a tablet taking photos
this is what you get when you go for the star g640 line friends edition and yup
now let's put it to the test while i do the first step in creating my background
i actually prefer this small tablet especially if i want to work on the couch or at a coffee shop
and then we have some paperworks and the stickers testing notes and the cutie ruler slash
then add the light source and some highlights then change the shades of each objects and add shadows
it is actually the same size as my laptop so it fits perfectly in my laptop bag
it's super convenient for zooming in and out which you can set up in any way you like
and that's thanks to it having a fully laminated screen which also means it has no parallax
i just add very mild highlights and shades everywhere and a bit of additional dreamy lighting
the feel is different and the response is a bit slower because of the slightly noticeable delay
the deadline of submission is on april 20 2021 and the announcement of winners will be on april 30 2021.
This tablet literally went live today, I've been reading up about the specs and details and it seems like Wacom
I'm excited to kind of try it out and see if it lives up to the hype.
XP-Pen knows that I've recently reached a million subscribers, they're super generous and so Christmas came early!
Oooh, ahh! [Sparkle noises] I feel like they really improved and upgraded the quality, versus the other XP-Pen tablet
Brought the tablet over to my setup and this came with the tablet, it is a box of wires!
Aahh gross, I definitely feel like they could put a little more effort into their packaging
This is a character in my book named Amé and you might have seen her from the Master
So this is the piece that we'll be working on today, I don't really have a background figured out
so maybe we can like spice it up, we can make a really cool background and set the mood.
And getting into colors and display, the Artist 22R Pro has better NTSC at 88% and better sRGB at 120%.
Here is why I feel overall numbers-wise, the 22R beats the current Cintiq model, because one: it has USB-C!
And you do have the options of these express keys on either side, where the Cintiq doesn't.
To be fair, the Wacom Cintiq Pro does have USB-C but it retails for about $2,499.
Also I think there's like a 30% off deal going on so that's even a lot less.
All that doesn't matter if the drawing experience isn't good and so let's give it a shot.
Amé is an arcane mage, just kind of like a vampire. She's deadly AF and she's awesome!
It no longer requires batteries, that was something that I didn't like in the previous one.
I've collected some of these over the years, it's just endless inspiration and reference for me to use.
Yeah let's try to find one of these stock images that kind of helps us with our mood!
Sometimes we can't come up with moods all by ourselves so we just need something to help us.
I just spent a few minutes trying out different things and the possibilities are endless, you know.
And I have this hand on another layer, and so we're just gonna give it a glow- Oooh!
All this cool, you know, and then we have this focused point of warmth which really makes Amé pop.
I feel like as I introduced the background for Amé's piece it also effected my real-life environment!
[MAGIC NOISES] So let's see how well this can color dodge. Ooooooohoohoohoo! That is so juicy!
I'm not sure, I kind of like my style of working for the last few years.
The best way you can find out for yourself is if you just try out all of them!
And although putting everything in a box may seem practical, it could look a little more aesthetic.
But some of you guys, you know, don't care about packaging and that's totally okay, you'll throw it away anyway.
If you could draw anything and have it come to life, what's the first thing you would draw?
which i think is a bunch of crap the MSRP on this is three hundred and fifty dollars
it's mostly a gimmick it not on a tablet but on this kind of thing this kind of laptop combo
Celeron processor which is mmm you know passable as mentioned it has a touchscreen there we go
if you don't really care about how it looks you can skip on a little bit and get to where
I'm showing you the port's where I'll hold it up like this and show you the port's general construction
it makes it look cheaper than it generally would which is too bad the other sacrifice of the screen
I believe so let's talk about what comes on it it does come with some basic
I do a whole lot of indie gaming so if it ran my indie games just great
that's kind of rare for a mechanical hard drive so yeah that is pretty nice port wise
there is also another thing that you don't generally see on very inexpensive lab tabs is an actual Ethernet port
so you can just plug it in there charge away not bad also there is SD card reader
it's just sitting there on a button on the machine itself so quite nice um battery life
I have found that I could easily get six hours out of it you and when I'm beating on it
I've been able to get between five and six hours from it so that's actually good again
I you know this is a $300 device really quite nice alright so I suppose you're wondering
I think it's an attractive looking laptop which is kind of unusual in its price range
the processor is okay memory quite good for the budget range or at least acceptable for the budget range
actually when you go to the settings you will be seeing a lot of seniors in the keys
the way you towel things off and on that is all changed and you can see
there is no much hassle with the keys a very few a physical keys are given
these are all the ones power the back and the menu and another volume toggle keys
hey what is going on guys lon here from Android authority and usually when we think of budget or cheap
I don't think many people will have too much of a problem with it while I do wish
just fine no real problems there but with graphically demanding titles while certainly more than playable
it's not going to replace the camera on your smartphone which is most likely better anyways
the a 8 and a 10 are running on the latest version of Android with 4.4.2 kitkat
I think they're pretty fairly priced for what they're capable of and are a perfect example of you
brightness of the screen is okay but the resolution is very low it is 1024 or 768 pixels rate inches
which is great for reading books and surfing but Widow will be small round of the string on the bottom
just make sure you don't block the speaker tablet is built on in toffee texture and it's powered by into
what should does not reckless drivers for touchscreen which is a dog problem like on most tablets
how about have 32 gigabytes of Samsung memory and there is Penta gigabytes free space out of the box
both cameras on device are 2 megapixels with similar picture pole they are usable only for communication
there is once patron device the top edge with distance and but your life is not great
I need to last for half a day of larva usage and three and a half hours of intensive usage
maybe a little smaller than an iPad so I'm just keep this in my computer bag
and then only the pen will have an effect on the tablet at that point okay
so let's just choose next the wireless connection which we've already done and we can do this later
let's go down to our tablet settings under preferences make sure you install the latest welcome driver
so let's have a look at the settings right now okay so we can go to
I just work in this very very small area and I know some retouches will do that
I hit that button so you can set them up to do different things but notice right now
I'll say it for modifier keys options shift and command and in that way I can do my keyboard shortcuts
now the forward and back buttons on this pin you can also set these buttons to different keyboard shortcuts
I like to do that too for undo and redo so that would just be command
so there's a couple of things we're gonna look at shape dynamics that's gonna be size so if
the other way we could do is we could change it to pan tilt but that means depending on how
here's our size here is opacity and this is flow if we airbrushing so why don't
I'm just adding a little shadow in there little shade give it a bit more dimension
maybe put this up to 30 because I want to just give this a little bit more
response and a lot of those 8,000 levels a lot of those are pushed into the very light areas
so you can just use a very very light touch and that's one of the things
ring that notification bill so you know when I upload which is usually every Tuesday and quite often
thank you take the spotlight with a release of one of their mid-range tablets presenting the Vanco matrix pad s8
you have an 8 inch isp display and a 2 megapixel front-facing camera to the side
a micro USB charging port and a micro SD TF card reader and to the back of the tablet
it's one of the few apps that allow you to set the display quality from low to high resolution
the box has chorus for playing 4k videos such as h.265 each EVC h.264 and vp9 decoding
tony here with itech check and today we're going to be taking a look at dragon touch's notepad 102.
i'm going to run some videos and you can also get this on amazon right now
we have the tablet which i'm going to be putting off to the side for just a minute
it looks like we have our little instruction booklet and a little sim ejector tool here
and it has a usb type a plug on it and that is pretty much it for the box
it feels like it has a all metal back which is surrounded by a plastic edge
we have both of our stereo speakers and we also have a little connection for an optional keyboard
it just makes it uh that much more sleek and less sharp on those edges okay
so i've only installed pubg like i said it's already used 30 of the storage 9.67 gigs used of 32.
left that's still a good amount of storage and we have the expandable storage as well
and if we go into our settings here i can show you what the graphics are set at so right
the back camera for the video is only 720p and the front camera is going to be only 480.
it's still just as smooth as it was when i first turned it on as you can see
it's not the best but it's definitely going to give you a decent video experience now
one thing that i did notice is taking this outside to take some video and some pictures
there was a lot of glare on the screen and it did dim the screen down quite a bit
it's definitely going to let you do all the normal things you do on a day-to-day basis
does it feel like it's going to break or you're going to be able to bend it in half battery
i hope you have a great day and i'll see you in the next one later
today i'm going to be looking at the lenovo chromebook duet which is a two-in-one chrome os tablet slash
that was uh kind of a bust right off the beginning but i feel like they've done a great job
that is kind of flimsy but it does fold out and does have a wide range of angles
has you know a metal back with like this blue accent on the top that i think looks great
i cannot believe the value that you get for the price here as for the keyboard
inch tablet so you have to go into a purchase knowing that this is going to be a smaller keyboard
you can only click down on the front of it but it's a little bit small again
it works for what it is and it comes in the package so i can't complain too much about it
the back kickstand does have a really nice magnet and a good connection to the back of the tablet
i never felt like it was going to fall off or slide off at any point
well now this specific one has a mediatek helio p60t processor that's clocked in at two
you know when you need to type out longer assignments or reports or whatever you need to do
this doesn't have the processing power to really keep up with that workload and number two
you're probably not gonna be able to get all the software that you want on this
you know super intensive games like call of duty and whatever else you might be looking at
make sure you like and subscribe and i'll catch you guys in the next video you
Ling effect here in the top on the side you can see there is lips side
there is a stereo speaker provided and on right side there are lot of things going on
it's a USB C type charging and then there is accessory box provided in the accessory box
they have provided the long USB C type charging cable which is quite long to use
so you don't have to be near to your socket and then there is a adapter which is again
let's fire up the main tab okay so by default it's into portrait mode under unlock
having everything is descent a resolution is not for a are not very extraordinary but for daily use
which is a little on the low end but unless your child does a lot of multitasking
this helps protect the tablet from small drops and bumps which are bound to happen with children
microUSB charging input and volume controls are located on the bottom which they can be accidentally bumped
if you're not using the cover overall the king pad kaydee seventy-seven is great for kids
I have to record the most satisfying part of any unboxing and that is the screen protector
you're working with now before we go into the tablet even more and do some drawings
you need for the tablet so let's quickly discuss how you fix these setup issues so first problem
I encountered was where I actually tap on the screen but it goes back to my main display
you just download the firmware for the tablet and then install the drivers after setting that up
it is very very good at detecting when you're pressing down hard or soft and that's good because when
I have this on a flat surface and push my hand against it whenever I'm drawing
it feels really nice to hold and there's nothing wrong with it but the buttons on the side
obviously they sent this tablet to me for free in exchange for a review on the channel
place them in the comments and subscribe to my channel for lots more toy reviews thank you
i have to download the driver as usual so i went to their site downloaded the driver
according to the pen displays model and set things up here is a brief description about this pen display
where you can customize when you download the driver and the resolution is 1920x1080p which is the standard resolution
the colors are really nice too but it seemed a little bit warmer in the tablet
i don't know how to unbox boxes because this is my first time unboxing an actual box
and then you have openings for all the the power of the volume rocker you have openings for the camera
obviously it's very protective and it's a really easy one to hold and handle so for kids
okay it has an amazing metal body slim design you can see see by looking at it
okay now let me when I switch on will see how the quality of the operating system is
jack as well it comes with a free USB type-c charging cable and a mains plug
I mean it takes ages this loading bay for lucky you know the latest Android tablets or smartphones
quick about their loading for some reason takes a lot longer should I just load it up straight away
so when it comes to protection is quite difficult to buy spare parts for it for this
have you have the display here so notification ring apps storage so storage without downloading anything
already taken up so you got just a bear around just say your 25 gig left ok so to download
okay so this is the quality looks this looks like a VGA camera when you take you know frantic foes
wouldn't be the best but the fact that you can do a video camera and videoing
they're 4k video playback it has a USB type-c it has a high battery capacity the downside
you get the pen you get a pen holder and inside the pen holder are some spare tips
and if you have the optional wireless kit installed there is an on/off button for it just here so
the tablet is connected to the computer now on the surface of the tablet is the active area
it's delineating by these four corner markers and it's in this area that the pen operates and effectively
and we'll see that a little more in a minute and associated with the touch ring there are four
Photoshop and I've got the brush tool selected and I'm now going to draw a couple of lines
the top button has this drop-down menu associated with it and the bottom button a similar menu
it's moving that cursor left would one click at a time if I press the top one
now let me give you just a very quick example of one way you can use this tool
I'm trying to remove their pencil lines on the top of a piece of white plastic work surface
I just use it and press harder when I need to and so there are my bits and pieces healed
and there's one down here in this corner and that's it so you can do this very easily
- Today, it's the $1,000 tablet versus the $100 tablet, plus a drop test that led to this.
If you've never seen me before, I hunt down deals, I test products, all of which are available on MattsDailyDeals.com.
for my next video, and subscribe, turn your notifications on, you'll never miss one of my huge deal drops.
And then obviously, you'll see the night and day comparison on where this tablet holds its own.
Oh, they've actually improved their packaging a little bit. Now this is by no means Apple packaging.
So, the iPad Pro uses Safari and Amazon's own Silk browser is present on the Fire tablet.
Let's go to, I'm trying to find videos that I haven't opened before, so "10 Shopping Secrets."
That's fine. Let's open up something brand new. All right. By the way, you're welcome to join my email newsletter.
For this page load test, I'm going to load the $24 action cam deal that I featured.
If you look at the pages side-by-side, you'll notice that the retina display on the iPad
I definitely get a lot more annoying pop-ups on the iPad Pro in terms of backup and cloud storage.
I am very high up over the city of Toronto and I am going to shoot both photos and video.
I'm trying to do a fast pan just so you guys can see how this all looks.
You got a little bit of issues on the border, on the rim, but let's go again.
With the Amazon Alexa service built in, you can simply say the A word. Alexa, turn off the studio.
It can help you in different professions, and this tablet might not be the one to grab for that.
So for consuming content, Fire tablet. For producing content, iPad Pro. And either way, the tax on the iPad
Pro is more than the entire cost of this tablet, just to put that into perspective.
And again, if you did like this content, please feel free to give it a thumbs up.
it's almost like a chiclet style keyboard and it does feel very nice to the touch premium keyboard included
it is guys the high ten plus a very nice-looking two-in-one tablet so on the front
Windows 10 home 64-bit operating system Windows is activated and ready to use so from the 64
Windows and from that we have 31 gigs free to use so this is the full version of Windows
you see it's normally closed but then when uh tori um scans somebody with a temperature that passes
with the setup of the relay box and then a door lock and with a torrey software
look if you want to check out any of these cases you can find a link in the video's description
we have a microphone the 3.5 male audio jack and the volume buttons this tablet also supports
and how does I hope for so here is a quick sample of how they sound
and of course all the videos seem to go fairly smooth as well now you may have noticed that
but that's quite normal because of that fire OS and because everything is very integrated in that Amazon echo system
it offers a lot of value and for that $79 70 could get some much worse on tablets of realistically
Android apps don't actually need a super-fast processor so for basic things like surfing the web
it's impressive that it has a processor at all to be perfectly honest but you know
you might know just a little bit more here with the 1024 by 600 and something else
but you're gonna want to make sure that you pay attention to the viewing angles because from some angles
you know if you can afford to spend fifty dollars more and get something like the Nexus 7
I think the Nexus 7 is a much better Buy but the memo pad 7 offers acceptable performance
and look at these two tablets side-by-side and a video review of the memo pad 7
I'll be reviewing this tablet aspire brand code Xcode II and it's a it's meant to be a kids
okay looks like a easy cheap tablet you can find one of these for less than 30 pound
you can has a front camera with a low reserve megapixel probably gonna be around team epoch
so rear camera has a 5 megapixel with dual flash there it has built-in mic at the top
so it's more like carving things and stuff all right so it's not as sensitive to touch all right so
all i had to do was install the latest driver which can be downloaded from their website
and there's also a dial which has three main functions you can use it to zoom
and you can scroll up and down and you can switch between them by pressing the middle button on this
luckily for us the zoom function is actually very easy to access on this graphic tablet
you add layers in traditional watercolors as well so the whole layers thing in this one translates very well
i make sure that the brush or the layer is set to a multiply a blend mode
sometimes i can adjust the opacity of the brush but because the stylus of this is pressure sensitive
set i downloaded them for free on his website which i will link in the description box below
but in my opinion i believe it completes the entire watercolor look of your digital portraits
the same button allowed me to switch from eraser to brush which was very useful for this graphic tablet
it is what it is for its price and i think it'll be good for beginners
i am also welcome to any art products that you would like for me to review and try
it's not like Murphy cases where you can squash them to use them as a pillow
SD card slot will like that as well because micro SD cards are a pain can get lost very easily
so no trickery like that there but there's a menu home and back button which we like
facebook usually included in that list of things but as you can see their facebook for android is an option
let's load up a nice heavy website like I said oops BBC BBC as you can see
GZA mochis is a go to full site button but not as you can see it
i do believe there is this for touchscreen multi-touch battery life probably about two and a half hours
it's actually it's responsive usually tablet if the Enduro 9s at this point will go no one to but look
the problem is most the graphics have been replaced by squares it might just be corrupted
I just won the level so if you enjoy playing not a specialist for the BMP
I've had this for a while so I put several random bits on that is a different market
which is not half as good and there you go if you want a review of Android
i would say it's almost as heavy as the ipad and this is only a 7 inch screen
hello you guys and welcome to a very special kind of video as you can see
I usually use but keep in mind that the actual playing field is only like this big
review I'm still going to give it a fair and honest opinion so yeah initial reaction is
I like it and the fact that it's so small it's not going to waste any space at all
I do think that I have a good understanding about the tablet and stuff what I thought this was like
then if they were to use a wireless a wireless pen then the price would go significantly up
uhnot so if you just started out and you think that a mouse won't do you any good anymore
this tablet is very focused on learning and has been launched with a special software this learning software called
bean 4.2 has a dual-core 1.6 gigahertz processor 1gb ram 8gb internal memory and there is also a card slot
sometimes the cursor teleports or stop suddenly it would be very annoying if that happens to me so
I think I'm not sure but I like to spend and the penny is not happy to next
all we have to do is download the driver from the company's website but guys don't download these drivers
thanks for watching this video and please check the description if you're interested in tablet bye
the tablet has a hd screen right there on the box it's a given that in 2020
but i'm glad i wasn't able to some plastic around the back putting the tablet aside
usb cable come on guys let's say bye bye to these things usbc would have been more preferable
good to know you get two years of that and finally the user manual so back to the tablet
it does feel a little bulky in the hand being one centimeter thick and even though it weighs 920 grams
let's quickly go through some of the specifications before moving on to the rest of the review
if you want to get better speed from your wireless connection finally you have a 5000 mah battery and gps2
the 10.1 inch ips display isn't full hd with its 1280x800 resolution at just slightly above 720p
there's no fancy skin running atop they pretty much stuck to something close to stock vanilla
considering this is a budget tablet it was a wise choice to keep the software as light as possible
but don't forget this is an android tablet with access to all the google apps including the play store
you're not using browsing the web or even scrolling through the catalog of movies and tv shows on
youtube is a little slow especially when trying to load the other elements but once the video is playing
whilst the 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor and 2 gigabytes of ram is good enough for basic tasks
i certainly don't but what we all do care about or at least should care about is definitely the speakers
so you'll want to make use of some wired or wireless headphones to get a better audio experience
it does most of the things you need it to do without any issues browsing the web consuming media
if you enjoyed this video and it helped you please subscribe and like that would really help me out
there is a simple USB cable but there is also tiny mini USB to USB cable
it better play that or I am going to be pissed of course it's made in China
if they can't make a god damn tablet you have to wonder how shitty their video cards are also
that's when i got a trackball mouse and i've loved it since and i get great great results
so the ideas of using the mouse that could cause carpal tunnel in my right hand
that's um no so i always opted for the easier way you know i just found
and that is the xp pen deco pro the deco pro line have two options a small and a medium
there's not much difference at all some of the features on these is that it's powered by usbc
this is finished lovely on the side and wraps around to the back with a brushed aluminium
if we compare the design of the pen you will notice that it's almost the same as wacom
that is the defining thing when you're doing a lot of exposure blending and dodging and burning
there is a little bit of a coordination that you're going to have to build practices needed for that
just edit the photos in lightroom but go into photoshop and do more extensive heavy-handed editing
your work is outstanding and i think the xp pain is a great option for you
they don't even know i'm doing this video like i said already i've owned two of these
it's one toward the price of the wacom equivalent and it offers everything that wacom are offering
because it's dark and you've got a couple of lights in your room now don't you
Raptor mommy and then you said I'm gypsies getting daddy in trouble without human ships's you yeah
wow this is the paw patrol learning tablet or paw patrol my first tablet the bidding always shop
this truck is blue bubbie drunk and who rides the police truck and is then is
we've got a USB port right here and it also has hosting capabilities even comes with the adapter
I would say is pretty bad as far as cameras go so basically like I said it runs Android 4.0
we've got the Amazon App Store in the one mobile market on here between those three app stores
it'll fit at that screen so let me go ahead and show you some of the other apps
I've got on here so one of the failings I think with this tablet is the screening
you've got different pictures of a whole bunch of different things that are up here in your app drawer
it just depends on what apps you have installed and in different widgets are associated with different apps
the box says four and a half for video playback so battery life is definitely the weakness of this tablet
i think the most i've ever had on a tablet is four so it's quite a lot
um you know for different usb port types and to fit in android and things like that
i've not had one with round buttons before i don't know that will make a difference
there's also a download guide on that same page if you need any help and click on the software
that's correct for you in my case windows um download it once it's downloaded go into your downloads
i probably could have used them but i felt i wanted it a little bit more sensitive
it wasn't any less sensitive as far as i could tell than like more expensive tablets
that is the one criticism i have with this tablet like everything else is absolutely brilliant
then i could just whip out this little tablet and this is like perfect for that
Sai and the tablet drivers every day just to get the tablet to work out of the box
all the time and accidentally deleting undoing swapping to erase or swapping to the cut tool
I think it would have been better leaving these as actual buttons instead of as neat little capacitive touch screens
the tablet has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity and a report rate of 250 PPS for a smoother drawing experience
and while they did ask me personally to review their tablet out of the blue from nowhere which
I super appreciate being able to keep my desk clear while I'm drawing so overall what
yes actually if you're looking for a good low-cost tablet to get started into digital artwork the
I had the pleasant experience of enjoying how smooth the pen drags across the tablets face
the pen is lightweight and doesn't require a constant battery charging like the Hawaiian Age 6/10
Pro does even though the battery lasts quite a long time on though aged 610 bro
and they also make an 8 inch version this one retails for $129 and the 8 inch version is 99
inch screen the 2 gigahertz octa-core CPU 3 gigs of RAM 32 gigabytes of internal storage and Android 10
and to my surprise it actually has a metal back so hopefully this helps with cooling that 2 gigahertz
a USB type-c charger port micro SD card slot compartment our power button and our volume rocker
so that extra gig will help out in the long run the display is a 10.1 inch 1920 by 1200
and this one is exactly the same we have a five megapixel front shooter and a 5 megapixel rear shooter
we have those dual stereo speakers up top and it does get pretty loud so YouTube works really
I did install the beta version just so I could see the FPS up at the top here
I've been able to run this on the $50 Amazon fire tablets and here performance really
SNES pc engine NeoGeo final burn alpha Game Boy Game Boy Advance and even Nintendo DS using the drastic emulator
but when we move up to the harder to emulate systems like even dreamcast using redream
i've run into issues even with some of the easier to emulate games like Sonic Adventure 2
we just can't maintain that 60 FPS threshold even with an easier to emulate game like this one
but that's what we get with a hundred and thirty dollar tablet really appreciate you guys watching
CD but they will provide you with a round shaped paper same size as a CD at first class
if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe and as well as thanks for watching
we're going to look at the xp pen innovator 16 and this is the anniversary edition
um it's ultra slim nine millimeters and it also comes with a portable stand and all the cables necessary
if you're into wearing those i personally don't use them but if you need it there you go
now let's take a look at the stylus in one of these caps on the cylinder
so it doesn't slide away from your grip comparing it to the stylus of the xp pen artist 22r pro
the main difference is the shape at the bottom of the stylus and the nip on the innovators
remember to remove absolutely all previous tablet drivers before doing this and after you install the driver
you can adjust the tablet's brightness on the two buttons on the side of the tablet
i like to work with it on full brightness because it brings out the colors better
if you're interested sign up to release the hero tier before october 1st 2020 to receive the term
it will be uncut and almost at real time so first of all you can also use this tablet
so from now and until their anniversary ends you can get the innovator 16 for 399
and thanks to xp pen for sending it over for my honest and personal way to review stuff
found it informative and if you have any questions feel free to put them in the comments
but the real key to it is all the software that comes installed on it has the
but we'll quickly take you through the hardware of it and then really focus on the software so
I'm gonna do now is just take it off so I can show you the tablet like I said
is you can tie chores to rewards and that this kind of not be points in dollars they get
you know toy you want if you do these chores so you do these various things
go into this parent mode and then this is going to look very much like any standard
so there's a major element of earning kind of by doing chores or educational lessons and things like that so
you can have your photos you can access the web all that stuff but in a safe environment
time when they're using this come on over to dance comm well the full review over on the site
send it to me and i'm gonna give it a review so let's just get to it right
this is the tablet and it's very nicely wrapped it has a sticker and it is very cute
and the little thingy that used to take out the nibs from the pen which i think
you're gonna connect your tablet to your phone and i'll show you how to do that
next was download the driver but i just went to their site on the note and downloaded
uh the tablet with different settings on the pressure levels on different applications like for example
i um set it to work software on clip studio bay because it just makes prettier lines
don't don't judge me okay so i tried it on with my phone to me personally
it is quite hard for me but it didn't feel like a pen was acting strange at all
you don't have to use a keyboard for that okay so i did a speed paint
i'm always used drawing on screen tablets so if it looks weird that is just my fault
i ended up using this for my online classes for my phonetics class in which we need to like
oh i use a graphical tablet and i was like happy that the teachers knew about that
it also has a nice heft to it which doesn't make it feel too cheap now
the plastic on the back does get dirty quite easily and so does the front display
i think the only reason they included the pictures is for that kind of gimmicky thing
i think that some people will find that kind of amusing from time to time especially kids now
when it's loading all the files up it does lag a little bit but after that it's all flawless
it doesn't get to the point where it's not bearable but it's definitely worth mentioning now
you want to feel like you still got 50 worth of money and this is it
as far as battery life goes it actually takes quite a bit of time to charge
a whole 24 hours and it only lost close to 10 percent which is really good
and then you're going to be fine and you can multi-touch and zoom in and everything without having any problems
you get the tablet itself power brick and USB cable I opted to pick up the green version
RAM which would definitely help out this little 7 inch tablet but we do get a better CPU
I gotta say the screen actually looks really good in my opinion that looks better than the Amazon fire
but they claim up to seven hours of reading video or music on a single charge
I'll leave links for that in the description so with the looks and specs out of the way
I'm not a big mobile gamer but I did find this on trending this is fury survival
Z some type of zombie game and it seems to perform well here and finally grand theft auto san andreas
I am using an Xbox one controller here connected over Bluetooth pairs right up with the tablet
buffering is pretty quick as long as you have a decent connection and it plays fine next up
FBA this tablet is perfect for it so like I mentioned the price on the new fire
it's definitely worth it but keep in mind that you're purchasing a low-end tablet this is what these are marketed
now if you're looking to buy one of these tablets just for video playback music and ebooks
okay so you can see on the screen different language that you can use on this phone
it sunset party portrayed a scanner so you your camera automatically will help out to had taken their pictures
it's a good brand is good tablet for a child if you're just put into fire
i didn't film an unboxing footage or anything so i'm just gonna show you these first of all
it has these two buttons just for switching between pen and eraser mode the nib is really good too
when it's all set up as i said this thing holds the pen and this is what it looks like
i don't know if other tablets do this but i think it's pretty cool one thing
overall deku is a good quality drawing tablet and i'm sure my journey with him will be a memorable one
the link to where you can get this tablet will be provided in the description below
it's got the tapered sides here which is a lot like the Dell Streak 5 on AT&T
it's another stereo speaker and underneath the door there is your SIM card slot and an SD card slot
the email if you've got it set up and adjusted all-purpose Android window so this is nice too
it does work in portrait mode as well thanks some of the widgets actually look better in portrait
Magwitch you can see more of your social networking updates if you have them loaded over here
something like the mytouch 4G for example on t-mobile when you stretch that to seven inches things do look grainy
Buy and Fry's in other places like this next book 7-inch ebook reader and Android tablet
now this has a resistive display which means no multi-touch no capacitive goodness and it really is very faded
thanks to dual-core CPU on the graphics Center in here you've got Blockbuster Video Brain Pop which is brain teaser
so that's the Dell Streak 7 it's available now on t-mobile from $1.99 with contract it is
a sm - t28 0nz kax AR featuring a 7-inch display this device is lightweight and portable
now that's the 2 megapixel rear camera 2 megapixel front camera camera is not really needed for kids
it's a seven inch tablet by the way so that it displays seven inch it has a android 10.0
gigahertz and has comes with a box speaker as well so box speaker is pretty loud now
this video is brought to you guys by dragon touch and we're taking a look at their notepad 102.
you also get bluetooth 5.0 wi-fi that supports 5g wi-fi and 2g wi-fi and gps built into this
but i think my favorite thing about this is the design it just looks so sleek
the uh display itself is also really really nice but i think my favorite thing is
and you can have video playback up to five hours because this is a 6000 milliamp battery
it can run your favorite games a little bit of web browsing a little bit of multitasking
USB port a headphone port it has a reset hole a power button and on the bottom
it's only viewable from front distance of about a foot and a half any further than that
it gives it a little bit more contrast and a little bit and it's a little bit sharper
let's go down to the about tablet you'll notice here it's Android version 4.4.2 and it is KitKat
let's go back to the Google Maps and I'll show you a little bit of the way they work
but this is the newest one that's popped up and supposedly the most powerful so in this video
viewing angles are pretty decent but they could be better because this is a non laminated display
if you look close enough there is a gap between the touch panel and the display itself
GPS built in an on user replaceable 6,000 milliamp hour battery and they're claiming up to 15 hours of usage
but it's still pretty good for a cheaper lower-cost tablet as for the version of Android that's pre-installed
it's only gonna run at a maximum of 50 and the flickering is very noticeable with this app
we have the Geekbench for score for the s 30 single core 797 multi 32 35 over on the right
it did beat it out in every one of these individual scores also in the final test
I wanted to run was some native Android gaming so we have King of Fighters all-stars
I'm using the beta edition so I could see the FPS listed on screen and we're around 36 fps
you won't get over that and even now when you get going or you get mining really hard
it's really hard for me to recommend this tablet at the hundred and fifty dollar price tag
now it's a dying breed most definitely but I'm still a big fan of Android tablets in 2020
I was planning on doing some emulation testing on this s30 but since we're running that 50 Hertz display
this is an eight point four inch Android tablet and it costs about 200 bucks on gearbest.com
typically repairs will cost less than your local retail store will cost and they guarantee there are parts for life
give them a call to even come to a coffee shop to get you going again
it felt like a build quality issue with it so immediately its curb appeal was not pleasing to me
the other thing that we noticed here on the screen is that it really picks up fingerprints quite easily
you can see just how greasy it is here and we really haven't been using it all that much
our out of the box experience was not great but that's said from a hardware perspective
not stereos and not very good sound quality out of this but overall I am ok with the hardware configuration
I think by and large from the gameplay perspective most of the Android games should run fairly nicely on here
nothing great but if you need a photo in a pinch you can probably grab one
not great but good enough for doing a Google hangout or a Skype call or something like that
so overall if it's not already apparent my enthusiasm for this tablet is not that great
I think you can skip this one if you are in the market for a $200 tablet
I do like the fact that it does have an ample amount of RAM and storage
which is good to see but that doesn't make up for its low quality build this is
hi I'd like to show off and give some of my impressions of the dragon touch
here speaker on the back speaker works ok so I guess I'm going to get into my impressions now
I'm gonna go into a darker room because you're not gonna be able to see it here
put the card in and out and then covered it up and maybe hidden it away from him but anyway
it's not pitch-black because my camera would have trouble taking pictures of it then and you can see
it's gone down about 10 percent of the battery so the earlier video in this one
I mean it has a wide range of videos that your kids can watch if you wanted to
essentially they can either put stickers on or they can draw lines but I mean they can choose different colors
which is a good idea because who knows who they're going to send video mail to and then like
this is the pin so you can enter any number you want but apparently has to be a realistic
it goes right back into kid mode so your kids can't really you kind of get around it
I've tried various things I try to go to the home screen and try to fall
but it's you can again download any apps that you want and the speed is okay
it does have a quad core in it but that doesn't mean it's a fast quad core
do you want something that you're not gonna feel too bad if your kids you know
I do think you get what you pay for but I want to manage your expectations
so you're gonna get a pretty decent set of hardware you're gonna get okay software with it for your kid
so huion recently sent me their canvas pro sixteen graphics tablet for me to review so in this video
I would use this tablet for 3d sculpting photo and video editing and for this review
a three-in-one cable which of course allows you to hook up your tablets to your computer
this one is made of soft lycra and nylon ten spare pen nibs with a nib clip
this tablet uses a full HD 15.6 inch screen with a 16 to 9 aspect ratio
the battery free pen has 8192 sensitivity levels and has plus minus 60 degrees tilt recognition
I like to set one of the express keys on the pen as the middle mouse
it makes it so much easier to get those precise lines exactly where you need them to be
I was really excited about the glove and I just couldn't wait to try it on
you know when you draw with a pencil on paper the angle at which you hold
your pencil has a huge impact on the line width the texture and what not so
this tablet's essentially allows you to recreate this digitally which is awesome especially for 3d sculpting
so the reason why you'd want more than one is that they tend to wear out and flatten with time
I'm surprised Huyen didn't include these and instead included ten identical ones but hey I'll just get them separately
that's a higher resolution than your 1080p nice flat-screen TV that you might own at home
CPU that one will have an even higher 2560 by 1600 resolution which matches the resolution on the 2014 edition
Note 10.1 and the Nexus 10 tablets as well but back to this guy right here
go back home over here and then go to books next sees all real quick and right now it's defaulting
Dropbox style putting your files up there that you can do that kind of thing too
Drive like I have music up there and this is not stuff I've even purchased them
bevel over here and there is a bevel so notice even if you put it on the table
the speaker's so your audio won't be muted which is very good so definitely some of the best audio
we have a microUSB port for charging and for copying stuff from your PC to the device
Android jelly bean underneath the heavily heavily customized operating system that you probably even recognize as Android
don't worry your ports in that vent that's just the way it's designed on the other side
this contacts and calendar application is an email application there is no gmail application by default display
we have our text to speak speech feature over here as well and the rest of it not as exciting
that's pretty much standard for a higher-end tablet or smartphone these days so that's plenty of
RAM to run any programs that you want it's available 16 32 or now 64 gigs of storage as well
you 229 the 32 gig is 269 if you want to go up to 64 gigs 309 dollars
it's up to you turn it off and turn it on and there's your offer so
obviously the book store the video store the magazines started the you name it they sell everything store on Amazon
it's actually pretty easy to sneak some of the Google applications on here you can see
the fellow has done a lot of work towards getting some of the google applications on here
and then look for the folder where you put it like downloads would be a wise place to do it
beautiful screen has whispers pink as you whispers sync as you can see so it can sync between Kindles
I've advanced my reading since I last use this device so very fast very nice white neutral pages very clear
it makes more sense if you have a big ten inch or larger screen to do that kind of thing
it scored very nicely twenty thousand three hundred eighty-two on quadrant which puts it up there with other
ice storm the extreme test not the basic test sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty seven
WebKit based web browser and obviously outside loaded Chrome as well but I have nothing against silk fluid
it's fast it plays html5 video and we'll look at a video in fact review our Note 10.1 2014 edition
well you know there are plenty of seven and eight inch tablets on the market right now
well that's going to work too because there is Amazon Prime for iOS but for those who have Android
be sure to visit our website for the full review and don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel
I borrowed it from a friend so I'll be comparing it to those so starting off with the pen
it's a nice luxury but it's not really necessary and but basically the design of this is really ergonomic
I like the way that this part thickens and the rubber grip the weighting of it
I think and I'm not really that like I don't baby it and I don't like try to push
I can't imagine he's pressing down so much harder than me that it wore it down
I don't doesn't affect the functionality of the pen and the pressure and stuff you just lose those two buttons
wrap the cable around a couple times and then stick it in my bag and that's how
because you know it's all computer and everything like that but this thing is super sturdy man
I think I already showed it from side view but it's really think the construction feels super solid
I'm going to bang it around and push my luck but um but really this is
I don't remember if I use many brushes with the tilt feature there but it still works the tilt feature
it'll work you don't need to like plug it in before you start up your computer or anything too
let me compare it to the bamboo more the memos significantly cheaper but I would not recommend it
one of them had like a big crack down it or something and you could tell the whole
I kind of liked the idea of having it at a at a 45 degree angle
you just go like that as opposed to having to really move across the whole screen so
a lot of people might not be able to afford that especially right now so today
we're gonna be taking a look at a more budget-friendly tablet that has a lot of great specs
it's got a 13 megapixel rear camera and an 8 megapixel front camera it has bluetooth
Wi-Fi antenna GPS and it has a 6000 mAh battery that should supply about 15 hours of use so
it feels nice and solid doesn't feel cheap or like it's going to bend or break on you
sometimes it can be really bad and really uneven here with the matrix pad as you can see
everything seems to be working pretty well and I haven't had any issues since I've been using it now
it'll definitely give you a loud enough sound to listen to anything you need to you
that's going to be using a tablet that's going to be streaming and wanting to you know
I don't really care how slim the tablet is as you can see as paired up by the galaxy s6
so if you did need to use this tablet for reading you can definitely do that
definitely going to be easy to do some reading now as far as the screen brightness goes right now
the only time you're really going to have problems is if you're watching something in direct sunlight
really well if you're going to use it for a streaming or reading listening to music browsing the web
it does pretty much everything you need to do except play higher res games and like
I said before you're not going to buy a hundred and fifty dollar laptop it and expect it to run
your you know really high-end game so as you can see we're playing temple run here
and then here's a little sample of what the video quality is like on the tablet
don't forget to subscribe and hit that little notification bell to let you guys know when
I did quick unboxing of this unit that I plan to install in the build f-150 and it's a 12.1
you do have to follow the directions which you're only in video form on their website
if you don't intuitively know how to do it you end up reusing parts like this
if you want to add in the beer cameras and a front camera you can do aftermarket it
okay if you have the other style the manual you actually have to order a different kit
here's the choices you get you do rear cam but if you guys know anything about
Reverse right if it's in Reverse it does its on its own and it's actually pretty good about it
take you back to your home screen and then you can get back to your you know so
I mean I think I can even enact Street View on this is which is pretty
I'm on the fence with this thing do I keep this or do I send it back
this was in a very dynamic video but I really don't know how to explain this thing very well
it is what it is you know just is what it is alright guys signing out for now
today we're going to be reviewing a star of five by XV pen today is going to be very different
your evaluation of it changes over time drastically and that was the case for me for many other tablet products
I'm not going to name which is which but some tablets I didn't think what's going to be
and very decent turns out to be like literally unplayable so and that all stemmed from the fact that
I don't know children a better company to like deliver products like this or something like that anyways
you can like use it very very simple and the this is the signal receiver the USB
this is so there's that and there's also this there's like a sticker bottom like tab
but then like it's so grippy it's amazing it doesn't move around at all of my tat on my surface
and it withstands that very very nicely amazing job you have no idea of born business to me
as to like the tablet being too slippery this like no issue whatsoever amazing job 10 is nice
I'll be more than glad to answer any of the questions that you may have a little
its case already packed some instructions charger which comes in two parts really easy to put together
it's gotta be the case that it comes in and it's totally robust as you can see
it's about a few smudgy marks on it and there's because it acts like a bumper
but she's a bit younger than my son and then the other really cool thing that it comes with here
great product reviews bias guides and advice on some of the best parenting products out there
now this one looks like it has quite a few more languages as well which is interesting
Tabler is worth around the price of 50 to 70 pounds UK currency and you can get various different colors
he also comes over as a premium designed dragon touch case as well as you can see here alright
he also comes over two different kind of charges discharge up as you can see at the top
very takes ages to start up to navigate through some things it takes ages as well
I set so that's one good finger Barry so mostly when it comes to sensitivity was ease decent
you can all operate via adult mode or kids mode so you can go to the main menu
and you know that's none of a good thing about this other than that build quality was
it's not made out of aluminium or Metro anything like I just made out plastic and it feels quite cheap
but you know if it's for kids and then you know he's decent but for the price range
we also get a cleaning cloth and last but not least the user's manual along with the driver
that are about twenty five point four by fifteen point two four centimeters according to UI
Express keys that can be reprogrammed in the software to assign functions such as control Z
has that rubber grip on the front and features two buttons that can easily be reprogrammed in this software
I know I might as well sell that picture for $5,000 if you're interested let me know
even including an 8 gigabyte micro SD card with that said I can definitely recommend this you
don't forget to subscribe and visit my website to see various there earlier than on YouTube
I think it's a human tablet that's a hand-me-down from selvan after uh they got their Experian
all right drivers done installing did not need a product key so that was pretty cool um
one the sticky time that came with the XP pan is actually for holding your pin
i hope it's serving you well but let's just get right into the good stuff once
it's got 10 challenging dungeons each with a super tough boss that requires specific teams and strategies to beat
raid's super active with over 200 000 clans fighting and competing right now and with over 25 million players
things i like about the game is that it provides a challenge and i'm always up for a good challenge
i personally enjoy the graphics and find it to be visually appealing especially for a mobile game
the extensive amount of content and champions also make the grind worth it the fastest way to level up
there's really never been a better time to start playing and to help get everyone started
back to the tablet review my cat butters couldn't wait anymore so we quickly set it up
it has eight programmable touch keys on the left and five menu buttons on the right
we were already working on a rosalina model and we used the tablet to finish the job
as the other models we made sculpt it out we topologize it rig it and into unreal it goes
but um i didn't open it yet because i kind of promised my family that i'm gonna celebrate with them
and now we're gonna be going to the resort this time so yes we're gonna swim at least today
oh if you want to say hi please say hi you were talking about that a while ago
hit home screen settings after you hit home screen settings then just hit this button right here where it says
just go ahead hit that and then you could hit silence right here so that one that way
this device is add different users on it so just swipe down from the right hand side
you can select the app tray but if you don't want it to do that just click tilt mode
just hit the button right here where it says screenshot then what you want to do is hit
then it says this device will be updated and it will fix the bugs and increase this device
type um lenovo tab m 10 plus full hd plus and then you just click that
it's going to be somewhere here where it will take you to the apps or you could just see here
when that's unchecked it's going to say dolby but hit that and then hit this option
it's on the home screen and it's actually password protected so you can go into the settings right here
um what you can do is wait for the screen to load on the web page
it's going to give you the option for screen recorder so you just go ahead hit that
it tells you that you could start now and it will um you you might want to hide sensitive information
and now even if i'm like in instagram or something like that the screen will automatically rotate
um to the way that i'm using it just because that app is now controlling the screen rotation another thing
that's pretty cool is in settings when you go to this option right here called screen assistant
a.m in the morning and then hit okay and then um you know it'll turn off
i usually put that for five minutes on my device right here so that it won't timeout
you wanted to hibernate from that a little bit so you would just turn on those ones
for the lenovo tab m plus full hd and i'll get right back with you later group peace you
we are checking out one of the latest affordable tablets from vasquing called the kingpad s810
the tablet itself looks and feels more expensive than what it is and that has a lot to do
asian feel of this one so the top we have that slot for the sd card on one side
and of course you have a usbc charging port on the front we have a 10 inch ips panel
so it's not the fastest charging out there all right so this is running android 10 as i mentioned earlier
we also have a camera on the front and one on the back of the tablet
zerrin and i just wanted to give you a quick overview of this 9-inch proscan tablet
I bought the two of these last Christmas and thought they would make great gifts this
you're just not going to be able to write a lot of apps at the same time and you know
expect expect what you're going to get for the price but I think what I would want to say
Can I just say this is one of the biggest reasons I love Android and over the years
All of it made possible by the fact that you can kind of put Android on anything.
So it should come as no surprise that it's perfectly content to run an E-paper screen as well.
Instead Nova 3 Color packs a basic black plastic casing with wide radius corners and sort of retro home button
But honestly, after just a few hours with both I scurried right on back to the Onyx homescreen.
Now that said this display does offer much faster refresh rates than any E Ink screen
It's bizarrely satisfying to be able to run the same apps and visit the same websites
Well, as always there's a trade-off, the faster the screen is set to refresh, the bigger the image persistence problem.
That's where shadows of images you were just looking at, stay on the screen even after you scroll away.
Even when you're set to normal mode you get more ghosting than you do on a monochrome screen.
swipe gestures or stick with Android's old nav keys which have been stuffed into the notification shade.
So if you're listening to an audio book you have to keep the screen on while you're doing it.
- Or if it ran something more modern than Android 10, the $419 price tag would be easier to justify.
I'm glad the Nova 3 Color is on the market and it definitely fills a niche.
I just hope the next version is a little more refined, or, priced a little more palatably.
google has pretty much given up on them and samsung is still trying to make android tablets
they're the most popular tablet out there period but one company that's continuing to make android-esque tablets
i've had my fire seven tablet for a while now and it's been an interesting experience to say the least
let's start off with specs because that's where you can really see this fifty dollar price tag
and that's what you really want to keep in mind with this tablet the price tag
it's a cheap tablet by just looking at the design the display has some rather large bezels
you can download on the amazon app store a web-based youtube application which i guess gets the job done
the good news is that it does have a expandable storage slot up to 512 gigabytes
you can move applications around and but that's pretty much it you kind of have amazon services up front
have this already built in apple for some reason doesn't have the ability to add other profiles to the ipad
that's pretty good right so the question is who is this tablet for and is it worth it
because you don't have to worry about losing it or it getting broken it only costs 50 bucks
but now you can buy here at lazada an absolute steal and much cheaper alternative to the budget
all you need to do is to click the link on the description box of this video now
as a result you can expect up to 7 hours of none non-stop video playback while streaming on mobile data
it's the the Burdick with access to a solid display insolent battery life in above average performance
if you're looking for a gaming tablet but if you need a clear and bright display the pit in each
you'll see lots of clouds with a high 49 degrees and a low of 39 degrees
so you can have more control over your mobile games like you would with a console game
note if that's possible we've got a camera located at the top here and then our 7-inch touchscreen display
we then have the power button as well as the volume controls a microphone a headphone port and a micro
you have to kill things and complete quests and upgrade your armor and stuff like that
and this actually got a score of 3629 the graphics cool with 3221 with a physics score as 6512
it's happened on various tablets that I've used in the past so now let's talk about this controller device
I love the fact that the tablet slots into the controller and then it's completely stable
and we've also got our triggers on here as well like you would expect from any controller
7 inches is a nice width to have your hands apart and I really really like that
it doesn't feel weird it doesn't feel too big it's comfy in your hand and this doesn't weigh really anything
I think the wiki pad is a great device for someone who enjoys mobile games but would like a controller
most people normally take your phone and have a normal kind of xbox playstation style controller underneath
this is the kind of thing designed to use on public transport where a laptop wouldn't really be suitable
it's got a huge variety of games that are compatible with it and it's endlessly growing
you should definitely check it out if you are a mobile gaming lover personally for me
it does just look like you're attaching a controller to a device with which fans me
because we have videos individually on both of these and explanatory videos on what collido is
the keyboard case connects easily and provides a comfortable typing experience and the built-in trackpad is responsive
the tablet also features 64 gigs of built-in storage with almost 49 gigs available out of the box
for the purpose of this demonstration so add fingerprint and put your finger on the sensor
try again so you're just moving your finger about and the natural sensors making a copy of your fingerprint
there makes it certainly easy to turn on and off so where we are now also included in
we swap the the voltage at depending upon the current state of charge of the tablet exceptionally fast charging
front camera is 13 megapixel and the rear is 8 and the results are astonishing again
I think the only other thing possibly would be no SIM card but there again I expect
most people are going to be using this around the home so um not a big issue really
this table has been 2 years in the making from teclast and it's a vast improvement over previous models
I paid roughly the same for my old one back then as the q1 1k costs today
yeh technology now if you didn't already know this tablet is wireless which concerned me a little bit at first
nibs that the tablet comes with as well as a little place for the wireless adapter now
I did run into a few hiccups when installing drivers but it was kind of almost entirely my fault
remember kids when the instructions tell you to install the drivers before plugging in the device
one of the buttons is automatically set to switch your brush to an eraser which is great
I don't know how else to describe it occasionally when I was doing some quick frequent strokes
I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone who has even at just a passing interest in digital art
what do you get first of all you get the tablet and as you can see here
you can actually just turn a little switch so you don't have to worry about it now
it's really nice and then when you grab the pin and you start to draw it
there's the after image just playing around a little bit on this tablet so overall what
it's kind of like working with markers on paper which works fine or you know both point pen
you can do different things and then when you're retouching your photographs or your drawing or sketching painting digital coloring
there's a little bit of card separating the new tablet from the rest of the box
cloth that you can see me displaying wonderfully here you have your smudge guard which is so you
don't leave any debris or grease or sweat on your tablet screen while you're drawing it resistance
there is another box and this contains your wires to set up now inside of this it comes with a
I like to affectionately named the pen tube which keeps your pen and all your spare lips inside
and it's also really unique and makes the most of its space now on to the actual tablet itself
the driver specified wait for it to install and then open up and let it run
after this you need to reboot the tablet and you're pretty much all ready to go however
it is a fantastic feature that allows you to go through your your tools very quickly while you're drawing
being able to switch from an eraser to your stylus by flicking your pen is fantastic
it makes your workflow faster and it feels more natural one drawing this is a feature
this tablet only cost me one hundred and seventy pounds and it's fantastic value for the money
if you're looking to buy a screen display or a few who are getting your first screen display tablet
Wi-Fi as do all tablets but it also has 3G now three G is a cellular connection
this is particularly cool because this particular tablet actually does a great job with video content and it supports
in a little card with ready for this up to a hundred and twenty eight gigabytes of additional content
pretty cool and there's a little teen 10 camera in the front and the camera in the front actually really
I said video playback at 1080p which is full HD and it supports Direct TV etc
that's alright it's pretty fast for a little device sizes so this is the full version of Windows Windows 8.1
you got to log a pixel camera at the front and a two megapixel camera at the back
the weight of the device is 280 grams and is eight millimeters thin light and portable
ok just installed sonic - a game to see what it's like playing the game on this games
i think um i think i've done an android tablet once or twice in the past
screen uh 1200 by 1920 so a little bit better than hd technically um and it
i ran it on all of the stuff and that way i had something to judge it against now
i don't think you know i didn't expect that to even do close to any of my bigger items
i don't like that i'd rather have a door but then again once you put the sd card
it's not kind of designed where you don't know it didn't come with an sd card
i had just an extra cheapy um small one that was lying around and uh yeah
um now i have let me uh sign into the tablet real quick and there we are so now
it's nowhere near the power that even a 5th gen ipad has so to be honest about it
you're not going to do anything heavy gaming on this thing it's just really not built for it
some of the more intensive games um yeah battery life they say expect 10 hours of battery life on this
i've hacked the fire tablets before i've done a lot of things but this is already blank
um not a bad little tablet um you know i wish i could show you more
it's it's not the ipad pro that i'm used to but it's not supposed to be
uh scan engine that uh we're calling it flex range internally and it um it's it
the scan engine is small enough and that it'll it'll fit in a product like this
I have reviewed a lot of tablets on my youtube channel as well as online blog
there's a little note if you want an extra month of warranty you can like their
each one has a firm audible click to it and also it gives rather some compress very nice tactile feeling
be careful not to lose this and this is the USB Drive with the drivers on it this
even though there's no rubber grip it still goes quite firmly because of the matte texture
there are two buttons on the side and tips is here you move very slightly no different from others
Dollars and right at the back there is no eraser there is also no much hugging
it doesn't need to be powered by battery which means it will never run low on the battery
and this is the stem you can put the ten on it horizontally or vertically like this
this small hole at the back can be used to remove the tip from the pan
you have to turn the Pens then the bottom of stem counterclockwise and this will review the eight replacement tips
maybe you just want to use half of the tablet for whatever reason you can change it
here is tap for the expert keys so you can assign specific keyboard shortcuts to the six
so that's all there is to change the function of the scroll wheel you click here
I've just connected a charging cable to this tablet so this light is lit up right now
I have zoomed in to 200% so I'm going to show you the thin strokes that I drew earlier
when you do cross hatching the strokes they taper very nicely so this is great some tablets
The Strokes they taper a bit of broccoli here it's white smooth and the transition between the Dean and fake
choose pressure set the variation to the maximum and now pressure is working without the welcoming towards driver
if you want to check out the 100% screenshot of the files you can visit my tax review
I will put the link in the video description below so the strokes a paper very well
- the transition is very smooth from into thick and unlike Photoshop when you draw with mini Bank
the pen does not require charging so this is very convenient and the overall accuracy the pressure sensitivity
it's been sitting here for two weeks okay and I just want to check if it was in there okay
I didn't actually open it though so there it is BAM man to see this there
I can finally take some minute check it out BAM there it is thank you for sponsoring me
just just pick it out this video it is reflecting so you can see everything in the background picture
this is the button - oh hey yeah and if you look at the side there's a power button
the answer is no you cannot this is uh only registers for pen movement and honestly
I'm gonna talk about the shading because the shading is the most important part for me
I don't even know if this is the right way to do it so what I do is I
it's a display that you can draw on then it also works at like an external display
now if you want to compare this against something like the Wacom Cintiq that everybody keeps talking about well
this was definitely a lot of fun to do and it was a nice little change of content
hey i'm ryan from technically well and i'm checking out the dragon touch i eight pro
shown here play very well for those interested the Geekbench multi-core score comes in at 2011
meaning that you can view it from an angle and the display does not look washed out
so you're not stuck trying to tap on the small screen elements the slim form factor
a type-c usb cable the manual the other half of the power cable and a type c usb adapter
the screen is a full 1080p and crystal clear when it comes to drying it comes with a stand
Keo in exchange for my honest opinion and I'm not gonna hold back on this one
look though it doesn't feel like the most durable piece of tech I've ever held and ok
that you simply don't need and tons of ads - unless you pay the amazon ransom first of all
charging speeds are pretty common with cheaper tablets so I can't complain here too much okay
go leave a comment on my latest photo of what you'd like me to review next because yes
anyway it does make it very hard to get feedback on the edits you're making so
I really can't recommend it at all here for more creative tasks which is a real shame of course watching
there's been no issues during regular playback at all so does the f30 live up to its own hype
I could see why the matrix pad s30 has so many five-star reviews in such a short space of time
it's got a black and white reading mode and zero bloatware thanks to Android Pi 9
okay it's not quite as powerful but thanks to Android Pi 9 it's a true Android tablet
so you might want to check out or you can check out my 5 best budget
A&C headphones by clicking here so pick one of those and I'll see you in the next video
I'm going to be bringing you my review of the Wacom Intuos pen and touch tablet
I like because I have the ability to set it right next to my Apple wireless keyboard without any problem
keep in mind that you may need to install a driver depending on what operating system you have
there are many different options as to what you can do here one of the things
keep in mind that this is a multi-touch tablet so you do have the ability for many different gestures
your radial menu allows you to have quick access to your most used functions this being my first
in applications like photoshop and photoshop lightroom one of my favorite uses for this tablet while i'm photo
but that's how you go home by pressing the bottom here but you have safari on here
alright now let's go ahead and check it out so for those of you who are new to the channel
maybe a handful of games but I don't like I don't really care for the bulky tablets
the company logo is right in the center and taking a closer look around the unit
the volume up and down buttons on the top of the device is where you'll find them micro
IPS stands for in plane switching and best known for its rich color quality and viewing angles
and there's just after that you've called 8o 64 and what this will do or what it will tell you
it will give you some more some more info on your system ok so starting at the system
I guess and my battery level is like at 69% so oh I need to cut some notifications off
I've been loving it since they since the company sent it out to me for review
I'm not a big game or anything like that but I'm more than happy to give this
I mean skills not all that but like I said all for the video and here we go well actually
this is a decent tablet beautiful rich display and is very responsive and most of my apps now
listen thank you so much for your support and I really appreciate you taking time and watching
though i would suggest sending me a screenshot in the future would be a good idea
here's the packaging very sleek if i do say so myself i like the fact that it's all cardboard yet
the only thing i didn't like about it is that um you're only allowed to draw in a specific area
i promise i won't talk a lot about numbers because that would be boring coming from me
the whole tablet is 12 inches wide and it has 13 multimedia buttons which is very useful
i'm the type of person that would rather draw with a heavier pen and this pen felt really light though
it's probably because the tablet is quite cheap but good quality nonetheless and i would recommend buying it
i tried to hide that fact that i was a sans fan girl from my friend
i'm that quiet art kid that still gets along with some people because they can quote unquote draw
those were the fun times though by that i suddenly gone across to a video called funny undertale comic dubs
our class suddenly got an announcement that we will have a transfer student to our class
i got the courage to go to them again and suddenly nervously ask um is that undertale
i could feel more panic inside my chest for even considering talking to them they were cool
well if you all remember the old undertale fandom was is that we would all say bad
but i don't remember much that's all i remember but i suddenly liked her and shipped her with sans
i've read and i've even made my own fanfics so you could just find it yourself in a matpat
my friend always knows what i'm doing since i always showed them what i've been doing
they've supported me when i made fano and wouldn't be and i wouldn't be here without them please
I was recently shopping for a new tablet pen tablet I was previously using the graph fire
four fingers up does a function four fingers down does a function five fingers in Photoshop
I've got my actual tablet up here in Photoshop running and I'm going to show you just a few things
I've got it set up for control alt pan and scroll like said since this is touch sensitive
if you want to pull up more properties all you have to do is go to touch properties so
I'm going to pull that up and it's down here at the bottom of my screen
does undo four fingers down does redo tap and hold five fingers it saves the file so if
it's really ridiculous if I don't want any opacity changes and just change the brush size brush size
you is my own opinion and has not been influenced in any way with the disclaimers out of the way
though it can be expanded with up to a 128 gigabyte microSD card 2 gigabytes of ddr3
button the power button as well as the volume rocker on the top of the tablet
thanks to the fact that they forgot to apply a copyright attribution to the film itself
you don't have to drop $30 for 50 movies unless you want a physical copy but of course
think of this like the old eye of the beholder games but with an open-world though
I will admit the main reason I've been spending so much time with this game lately
if you're wondering about this audio it's being recorded using the built-in microphone on the Matrix pad s7 now
yes some people might be put off by the fact that it doesn't have 5 gigahertz
the glorious touch screen runs a 920 by 1080 resolution on a 13 inch LED backlit screen with reinforced gorilla
Intel i7 processing chip 16 gigabytes ddr3 RAM with 512 gigabytes of storage on an SSD hard drive
it's here you can see the true power of an upper ed laptop really coming through on this
two-in-one feel / a tablet that being said there is of course an option for an on-screen keyboard
but for those hoping to use this device more for its tablet function it is recommended
the additional cost however is another 57 pounds 60 from the HP store as far as security features
it really is impressed by packing the punch of a laptop much larger and heavier than itself
the one drawback is the hefty price tag that currently accompanies the device coming in at 1954
let us know what you think of the HP lex-2 1030 g3 in the comments below
I've actually got the f5 attached to a vehicle docking station and with that vehicle docking station
then I've got my extra screens keyboard a mouse attached to it so there's a vehicle docking station
there's carry straps and shoulder straps and there's carry cases motion have got accessories like spare batteries
so you can see that it is a device that is designed to replace a laptop or a desktop
it'll just keep running while you have the battery out which is fantastic in the bottom of the tablet
Windows if I swipe my finger across that fingerprint sensor there it's effectively the same as typing in my password
here this is the unity is IP 54 rated so it is very water and dust resistant
we've got a few notes on the page here and I'm just going to configure the pin
we want the standard set up there so you can see that it works really really well
so it's something special that we offer with the motion tablets and it's available to you exclusively through tablet
I should probably have a tablet so I decided to jump in and get this one
the $400 + 400 to $600 plus ones like the iPads or even a $200 plus tablet for that matter
that's a huge bonus because even with 16 gigs which is pretty decent for a tablet microUSB slot
you get one gigabyte of integrated ddr3 memory and for a wireless connection to get eight or 2.11
but this is more of a budget tablet so it's kind of what you might expect you get a micro
I haven't played around with too much but that's one of the more recent functionalities built into Android 4.2.2
I found it very useful to do data entry while I'm running bit remarks since I have the Google
I'm disconnected from the internet while I benchmark and also I've been using for taking down notes
you might notice here in the corner for example some of the finishes actually rubbed off
I got the the carrying case for it but yeah oh okay build quality just a seven
I would say that it is fantastic and again that's a really big reason why I had
I've asked it to do so if you're interested in a tablet this holiday season check it out
he's really missing out but remember the Nexus 7 a fantastic upgrade option for this Fiona
I find that it's probably better to think of it as a notebook than a laptop on flat surfaces
have the option of doing prices start at about five hundred ninety nine dollars for model with a core
you shouldn't have any real problems with the high resolution screen but I do find that's interesting
it's not a high-end gaming machine here but I've just fired up Batman Arkham Asylum which works reasonably well now
I just want to show you that it can play and you can use the keyboard if you wanted to
so you can see it better but you can see my reflection so the camera angles are adjustable
the fabric of the cover and sort of the palm rest area is sort of this well fabric
I guess one other things I like to show is that it is capable of handling high resolution
so they're you two videos one 14:40 and one at 1080p and I'm not really sure what's going on there
this is Brad Linder with little feuding and a look at gaming web browsing web video reading ebooks
depending on the model you get this model actually comes with it and the keyboard comes standard
now it comes with a lot of attachments like keyboards uh mouse they give a lot of attachments
i don't have nails to open it but yeah it takes two aaa batteries to operate this
and it also takes a micro sd memory card so this literally is packed with a lot of features
so i've went through all the connecting to the the wi-fi you know putting the password on et cetera
i've gone through that so i can just show you exactly how it looks so now you can see
and there's chrome so i'm going to go to settings now on settings uh you have a few apps okay
like i've shown you and yeah so that's all the features so let me look for the galleries
that's the best thing i've taken one picture as well so i can show you how it looks
this one is pink but there's also a blue version so let's check out if you want this
let's peel off the film by the way there's also this custom case that comes with the iPad
Kiros is an app where there are educational games and save videos for your kids to watch
there's also Google Maps and email so you can also download new apps with the Play Store
there's also many different apps like this tag with Ryan ping-pong and there's even roblox alright
I think this wallpaper is pretty good so I'm gonna choose this one now that the wallpaper has been changed
I love how they have the kiddos and the parents can see what like the kids are playing and stuff
iPad so you guys can come with that down below so we really recommend this because this is pretty cool
iPad I think this would be the first iPad because it's cool like the kiddos the educational games
they can play that if you're just into getting this awesome iPad you guys can check it out at Amazon
it's linked in the description down below like you get two back yo for sending us this
if you get this question right you can get a bonus entry for our 20k giveaway
it has a girthy 21.5 inch panel which i found to be very nice as my usual
unfortunately i have no way to test the color accuracy so all i can say is it look good
so far is it doesn't like to move these things right here for some reason yeah
no just because of the resolution would i recommend it for someone in the market for a middle price range
the camera is located flush with the total body therefore that there are no protruding components in the plan
it's not especially heavy so it doesn't include a good deal of burden to the general package
the keyboard itself has a matte finish but the total situation has a velvet finish which makes it seem premium
multitasking isn't advocated in this manner since it tends to restrict background processes both the cameras around the chuwi ipad
the chuwi high pad lte shines we struck no real difficulties in wi-fi or bluetooth connectivity
it's possible to observe four to five hours of movies or play games on it for a couple of hours
so for most circumstances that the chuwi hi-pad lte ought to last you a whole day
it almost takes six hours for the pill to charge to 100 with the inventory charger
I have a little review of it for you and so that you can see whether it's worth it now
so let's read the box and say 7-inch capacitive display with 800 x 480 pixel resolution
I acid we got 2,300 milliamp hours like a battery for up to five hours use
it's a tablet perform using your busby seven for the first time please charge the battery completely
we'll see what milliamps this outputs actually help and to do 1000 milliamps of 1 amp
we have some power buttons which is always helpful and probably volume there and a back button
I'm just going to reconfigure the camera so it's a little bit easier for you to say okay
Google insists that everything is tied to the Google email account so how to Google account well
I'm not going to do that on camera obviously but I will you go away you know
I say you know it's it is what it is and it's 4799 delivered so I can expect so
it's quite responsive so you might show we go for about something that we all know and love
so that's downloading whilst it is downloading take an opportunity to just step back button there
let's see what happens if I pop the lights on here ye tun pretty much shipping this quality
i have no effing idea uncle bricks or something and it's already trying to sell my six-year-old something
I just hit the button to come out of it or did it crash what do you think
quick start now no idea right find it fairly difficult care so it will come out that
I hope you've enjoyed this review this is Mark for Mark fixes stuff signing off remember
here is pretty good and pretty close to your standard u-series ultrabook cpu and speaking of that
so we're getting a fresh look here with the intel 11th gen and intel iris xe graphics
i think most people will be pretty happy with it is a glossy display not crazy obnoxiously
that's more nicely configured say with a core i7 16 gigs of ram and a 512 gig
stick pointer for those of you who prefer that method of input so this keyboard is rigid
it supports touch obviously as well as the pen and the pen input on this is wacom aes 2.0
on this you'll have some diagonal line jitter but not bad for note-taking it's delightful for art
just because usually i don't think people pick durable think padlock tablets for that sort of thing
that's about where you would see in a 13-inch ultrabook these days and the 65-watt fast charger is included
so that's the lenovo thinkpad x12 gen one their competitor to surface pro more for the business market
they just want to get the product into your sweaty mitts and look a bit of Chinese writing
yes let's move that to one side and look at the device shall we immediate thing
mmm disappointing the rest of its so well made anyway have a quick look at it
some tell you when it's charging someone's tell you when you are connected wirelessly on the sides we have
so you know you can connect via 3G and all that the deep built-in 3G modem
we have another button from app x windows which is a bit disappointing is the same as that
also rotation lock although I've never got it to rotation lock from what I can remember
but it didn't take that long actually in fact it was about the same as the Android tablets
yeah that's kind of summing up with the whole thing really in fact we could probably leave the review there
click hold down for a second blip little circle appears and there comes your context menu
what you do is tap on the box you want to enter text into and nothing happens
we are potato has worked as I say you know I was comfortingly now now it does it
I'm going to stick to everything bog-standard on this because if not I would be here all month right
there is also another method for entering text and writing recognition which is actually really really good
good if you're on the fly like I find it much better than the crappy standard keyboard
it's a bit of a problem really so as I say download one of the others
oh sorry folks is not easy through a viewfinder right we can now probably expand processes
in what is technically an SSD I suppose solid-state drive but only technically don't expect be singing blistering fast file
this is far more on the speeds of a sort of USB interface e type thing
ISM there know as we haven't looked at the display adapter which is important for accelerating the videos
I mean everybody if you want to watch a video these days it nearly always h.264 isn't it
think an h.264 video file in 1280 by 720 or 720p as you may know it
I mean open with no dragon to that thank you as if I'd want media player to play it
I suppose a fairly unavoidable mm-hmm with more power comes greater responsibility and more fans as Uncle
now look camcorder filtered to talk into so you don't hear this all the time actually
we ensure them that today mate here we go it basically looks like a bit of paper
well i suppose now we have to do the infamous thing of throwing this on its side going
7 of course is nowhere near as tablet friendly as the iOS which is kind of specifically designed for it
well you've got the massive massive bonus and this of it being a massively open platform in many respects
and because well he had a really weird use for he's got it set up right
he talks without interrupting what he's doing on the main machine at all and also does the fact
he has it plugged into the mains all the time and I believe he runs it
it just occurred to me actually must have already plugs an external hard drive into it
yeah it's a really powerful and flexible tool but it's a bit rough around the edges
I don't know whether or not that is on but the tablet all comes in a separate USB
so this tablet has let's see 12 shortcut buttons and 16 soft express key buttons here
I think they are flush more - it's the surface also another difference is there are now 2 indicator lights
this is let's see live or the graphics tablet so it comes with a free glue
oh it actually comes with a pen cap now so older models they do not have two pen cap
I wasn't able to do that so be careful not to lose the cap so now
what went wrong with my tablet driver and it turns out he was the wind tech driver so now that
I have assigned this to control end which is a which is to create a new foul so once
so this is much more gradual compared to we our strokes which have this thin line right at the end
I'm going to create a new file and pick a brush here and see whether or not I can create
it's very good and main attraction is it has so much features and it's free so it's already hired
Pro let me show you the strokes the taper quite nicely as well very very nice
I've also shown you a workaround which involves installing the plugin called lazy crow lazy Nezumi
I will also post a link to the text review for this tablet in case there are any updates
For video recording, the back camera records 720P HD and the front camera is 480P SD resolution.
And the only accessories this comes with is a USB-C cable, wall charger and instruction manual.
Also notice there are headphone and microphone logos on the ends and the plug has 4-sections on it.
So just plug your external microphone into the microphone end and then plug the TRRS adapter into the tablet.
10 is set up to record video using audio from an external mic plugged into the headphone jack.
The 10-inch IPS screen really makes web surfing and watching video really easy on the eyes.
So if you want a full-featured tablet that's easy on the wallet, give the DragonTouch Max 10 a try.
my first impressions were that the screen is huge and the colors were very very warm and accurate
it is tender so you can change the pin with any other pins that you have also inside the standard
it weighs only 1.3 kilos which is almost 3 pounds for the first days of using this album
i had a few backs and witches some backstabbing such as my laptop was shutting down
a laptop is msi and belongs to expensive products and also have a very good hardware
i think that if your laptop belongs to those cheaper products you need to love it
still a recharge effective programs such as animate animate pencil c and blender these programs perfectly same with the product
i'm gonna go ahead and pull it out of there right pull it out and look it's clean shiny
but i'm getting it working on a cartoon so like and subscribe for when that comes out
you'll get a notification if you ring the bell but it does everything you're gonna need it to do
they don't really make cases for them but in the next video i'll show you what i put on mine
it's the spectra 360 convertible laptop tablet comes with the pen comes with a little leather sleeve
so you can stream and edit at the same time screen capture and you can do everything on this
and i'll see you next time in the next video when i talk about you know what i put on
I've had I would say in my opinion enough time to have a good feel of what this tablets about
you know but the my main problem is is a side viewing angles for for this
it's kind of hard to see as you are kind of tilt it a but then um speakers back here
it lags not always but for a low-end for like a pretty cheap tablet like this
except it's decent you know if you're looking for a 60 hour tablet this is uh
about what tablet is like the best to use when doing digital art and to be honest
inch of the tablet's active area the higher the number the better but to be honest
PPS is points per second and it's a measure of how often the tablet responds to your stylist movement
in a given second the active area of the tablet is six by five inches and now for the unboxing
i've seen don't have this but you can actually turn it on and off with the button on top
and lastly you got your spare pen nibs for when they wear out although the tablet is flexible
I did try this on paint tool Sai and it works fine there but for this example
I'll just be drawing in flash because you know that's what that's what I'm comfortable with
I can say that it does work well or as well as what I need it for
it's pretty responsive you know and it actually doesn't jitter that much or at all actually what
I'm just following the grid and it's a rectangle but I drew a square on the tablet
this is actually very good especially for the for the price this is what I notice
wow what a treat would probably double my work time but for the sake of his demonstration
is this tablet for you or not are mentioned on the back of the packaging starting with the 8 inch
where as buttons to control her available top left hand side starting with the volume control
not that bad at all you can also manage your storage easily to any now in terms of system wise
that's a typical user would do in terms of navigation within your YouTube application is flawless and straightforward
you can search me if you wanted to start with by just writing my name in there you know so
let me zoom the camera in a bed to give you more idea the performance of running
I'm on let's suppose let's go on to the Amazon website and you can go on
when you open it up you just need to plug in your earphones and off it
you can take a picture if you want to with that now to check out the front camera
purchasing this tablet was to play my plex media from an ass drive and so far so good
I would be happy to investigate and reply on that for sure now to conclude and give my final verdict
but what makes this special is that it's also a dual OS template it also has Windows 8.1
we've got the Marvel unlimited app here which we can use to read comic books and the display
I would expect in benchmarks for for a tablet running Android with an Intel Atom processor
now one of the nice things about having a tablet that can run both Android and Windows
Windows I think there's a lot of games and Marvel unlimited for instance and the official YouTube app
we've got this the windows experience here which is designed for touch screens in terms of the the
Google Chrome now you can use web browsers and Android but when you use them in Windows
it's a little bit different in that in that it's easier for me to make typos now in that
actually it's faster than I would expect for a Windows computer with an Intel Atom processor
I've noticed is when I'm doing things like transcoding videos using handbrake or virtualdub or other applications
I'm going to open the earth and view image editing program here and open a picture that I edited recently
there's and again it's go ahead and open that same picture and you'll see how small it is
and this is treating that the 2048 by 1536 pixel display like a big screen 2048 by 1536
that's that's not so bad but for the most part in order to keep things comfortable
I've kept it at the largest setting so that's one thing to keep in mind when you're using
I mean I'm sorry it only has 4 gigabytes of free space out of that 32
or two for it to reboot and switch operating systems in order and then switching back
Viacom or other sites that ship overseas he's buying is the site that provided me with this review unit
I can reset the clock in Windows but when I reboot to Android and back to Windows
I 6 err 3G dual boot dual OS Android and Windows tablet and the last thing
Plus this is the latest max version which will give you a 10 core CPU which is a Decker core
so we have dual cameras three megapixel on the front and on the back there is a 12 megapixel camera
so the tablet itself is made mostly from plastic however the actual kickstand is made from metal
now it's time to check out the results for all the various tests including Wi-Fi and benchmarks
Like and subscribe thank you so much for watching and I hope you all have a brilliant day
Gamal for sending me another one so the Galman s 56k is a flexible drawing tablet
it's not rechargeable like a lot of other tablet pens tend to be and it's not standalone liked
I found this wasn't an indication of the tablets actual performance because when I went into paint tool
but it didn't take me too long to get used to using that size tablet again like
hence the arrows and the green cloak to blend in with the forest and she's also from a merchant family
I just thought you know what I'm gonna make this character seasick so just have fun with it
I'm just not used to the texture of the tablet and the way that the surface feels to draw on
so yeah if you're just getting into digital ah and you're not sure what to go for
I would definitely put this forward so thank you gal mom for sending me another one
please do ask me if you have any questions and as always thank you so much for watching
it also has a USB host port a traditional one unlike the Arco 70 which was lacking that
did read some stuff online pertaining to this panel being the same one used in the viewsonic
256 Meg's of RAM just like the 70 the same arm a cortex 1 gigahertz clock processor a good chip
I put a little new source here not that CNN is my favorite but you know a popular one
we'll be missing some Flash content but as you can see really responsive working well pinch-to-zoom looks good you know
just as an e-reader again you're gonna want to use this in portrait not landscape which
kickstand know that in advance the accelerometer g-sensor seems to be working pretty well and yeah
use natural touch and flow so basically it has rotations rotational skills such as a scrolling zooming and rotating
it's not as big as my hand and great for those just getting started it's made by
so if you're not totally left out in the dark and have to replace everything so often
they're defaulted by turning on and off touch controls to the the tablet as well as other incendiary features
so it's not just there all for looks or anything you can actually use it that way
you can add shortcuts in there so you can shortcut to your favorite applications that you might use
and there are actually a plethora of applications that you can use for the tablet which
so that's just me given the test the trackpad a quick demonstration for you which is very nice
you can touch to play games you can you know just tons stuff you can even write out a tweet
Windows 7 Windows XP even a Windows Vista as well as Mac from OS 10 point four eight or above
use that link to let them know we sent you by the way for your United Kingdom viewers
I really like it because the previous one didn't sit well on my hand and don't look at this
but the thing is that you click with the pen you know you have to change them and the pointers
the welcome one was kind of short and that bothered me a little but yeah it was
but more about the tablet it does really smooth lines so the line art is just like
Jack very proud of this drawing because we didn't take it along but I think it's cool
I think it's really good and I really recommend it so basically everyone many my friends have them so
I said that just because they told me to but now that's not sure they didn't to meet you
music and videos storage can be expanded with microSD cards using the slot on the back
I bought it out of my own pocket so starting off in the box which I've already unboxed you
it's more comfortable for larger strokes and it's more precise also for higher resolution screens one buying a graphics tablet
Express keys all on the left side allowing for quick shortcuts on your fingertips you can also rotate tablet 180°
I the keys can be configured on the eg software that you installed from the installation disk
it's very useful for porn the undo and redo buttons and change in the brush sizes
it doesn't really bother me that much because when I'm drawing I'm looking at the screen
instead of looking at the tablet itself the tablet does have a nice slick design to it
so there is a wireless bundle but yeah it needs to be connected at all times
and the rest of the board just has a kind of a graphite finish to it on the back
I need a charger and actually the charge lasts lasts a very very long time one thing
and then we have the neighbor mover just in the middle right there if I can get that
then there's the double click time and the coordinates just gonna click apply real quickly there
but it's simple after you get you you get it figured out so you can pretty much use any monitor
I'm gonna work on Marshall one for now so I have went to all these sections now
you want to click that because people have said the press sensitivity doesn't work on some software's like Photoshop Autodesk
I'm an Autodesk and I'm just gonna draw a few strokes right here as you can see you can see
now there is a bit of jitter so when you're trying to draw straight line now
I talked a little today to the eraser by accident and you can see their pressure
if you enjoyed this video please drop a like and make sure to subscribe for more awesome reviews
thank you guys very much for watching and I see you in the next video bye bye
did you know in an access for access but other than that on the parents side
it's pretty much a full functional tablet on the kids side you can limit the internet usage
I didn't tell you anything about the device other than the various apps and it makes no sense
but anyways the speakers there's speakers on both sides they stick out like that it's kind of cool
this is the tablet itself with out the case everything is labeled which is kind of interesting
obviously you do have a camera on the front and back as well so yeah definitely
makes it a lot easier to figure this out and decided on how to review so yeah
Wacom tablet along with a quick user guide now from the tablet itself it is powered by one
I said before these programs these buttons are default ly programmed to right click on the top and pan
I highly recommend using this program for any sketchbook or nuts good good for any tablet needs
I found this tablet very customizable along with it's very key feature please rate comment and subscribe to my channel
- I'm Aaron Rutten, and today I'll be reviewing a brand new display tablet made by Wacom.
Let's start this review by taking a quick look at an overview of what the Cintiq 16 can do.
Quick disclaimer, this is not a sponsored video, but Wacom did send me this tablet, so I could review it.
The Wacom Cintiq 16 is a display tablet with a screen that you can draw directly onto.
The pen also supports pen tilt, which you can use for expressions like drawing with the side of your pencil.
The screen also features reduced parallax, so there isn't an abnormal gap between your pen tip and the brush cursor.
The Cintiq 16 can be used as a single display or as an independent display in a multi-monitor setup.
From the Wacom Desktop Center, you can control a few basic display properties such as Brightness, Contrast and Color Temperature.
I much prefer using the stand, so, in my opinion, it would be best to get one.
The stand is easily attached using holes for a VESA mounting on the back of the display.
If you wanted to use an alternative VESA-compatible mount, such as an Ergotron arm, you could do that as well.
Remote is supported, which will give you 17 programmable keys that you can use for shortcuts.
Absent on the side of the Cintiq 16 are any USB ports like those found on the Pro models.
But, in my opinion, Wacom has one-upped the competition by showing artists the level of quality
I can't speak for every Cintiq alternative out there, but some have glossy screens that create a lot of glare.
As I mentioned earlier in the review, I much prefer the Cintiq 16's matte screen with it's anti-glare surface.
It doesn't feel sticky or slippery like a glossy screen would. When it comes to pens, there's really no competition.
I'm not 100% certain, but I don't think many of the Cintiq alternatives support anything other than their default pen.
Comparing the Cintiq 16 to the Cintiq Pro 13 and 16, the Cintiq 16 does not feature multi-touch.
The Cintiq 16 has a decent anti-glare surface, but it does not feature the higher-quality, etched glass screen
The Cintiq 16 has a plastic bezel and does not feature the edge-to-edge glass design of the Cintiq Pros.
The Cintiq Pro 16 is about $750 more than the Cintiq 16, which is more than twice as expensive.
I was quite comfortable drawing on it, even though I'm used to having more features available.
Next, I'll recap a bit by discussing the pros and cons of the Cintiq 16, in my opinion.
And in regards to the optional stand, the stand is very stable when pushing or drawing on the screen.
Pros is definitely nicer, but don't get me wrong, the Cintiq 16 still feels great to draw on.
Another con is that I found it difficult to go from desktop to my lap, with the stand attached.
But of course you can hide that UI and then get more screen space to draw on.
But the overall drawing experience was great, and I felt right at home on this device.
everything that you need is actually built into the tablet display itself an interesting design feature that
one of the great things about the z22 is that it's powered by the latest generation
Broadwell is no exception but the big thing that you will notice by looking at around the Z 20t
so we're really getting into a good place in terms of battery life and power consumption of these devices now
I think that the z20 T from Toshiba is going to be a massive hit for companies
who are looking to roll out a laptop replacement device or a hybrid tablet laptop replacement device
funnily enough this is also a redraw which like the last tablet review i did was also a redraw
so this is all just my honest thoughts on this model and this thing is an absolute unit
the tablet itself comes with an adjustable stand which is also super nice and very welcome
it was so bright that i actually had to turn it down a touch when i first got it
space is only like two percent smaller than the innovator 16 which was actually my last tablet
nowadays it has 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity and also includes 60 degrees of tilt support
it's just a general psa for any screen tablet users when your tablet is plugged in
there is a small weird behavior when powering it back on as your computer will detect that
there are a few considerations that you need to take into account before you get this tablet though first
the redraw looks so much more dynamic and better proportion than the original in my opinion
this is a really cool opportunity so i said yes and now i'm here to talk about it
you can find the driver at www.gammon.net download or in the link in the description now
download the driver the setup page itself is pretty self-explanatory it's really easy to use and navigate
taking out pen dips when they were worn down but no longer no struggle for me
and it was really cool to receive one with the tablet instead of just buying it separately
it keeps my greasy greasy hands off the nice the nice cool tablet and it makes me feel cool
so it's like a fourth the size too big for me but point is is that it still works
big a 50 tablet which you can check in the description below or click on the
this tablet can be very very useful and it can be used casually as well like a mouse
a fifty is its build quality like the fit and finish is really nice as well as sleek
so there are eight buttons and a gesture pad which can be everything customized according to your liking for example
I use this gesture pad to zoom in and zoom out by swiping up and down respectively
now here you can systemize all the lay out like how much space you want to use
the awesome thing about this tablet here is there is actually option to use it like a mouse
the screen are supported which means you can seamlessly switch between the apps and can use it without any hassle
this tablet lets you customize buttons gestures for each application individually which is awesome and super convenient
it's so affordable as compared to other computers in the market with similar specs as well as the customisation options
this is a slightly lighter gray bezel but that we've got the exact same industrial design
microphone your power button back here and that extra special sauce underneath this little door just like the last color
little rubbery back much the same as the nut collar in fact almost identical this changes
pretty common for 7-inch tablets of all kind but inside we've now got a dual-core 1 gigahertz
so you don't get a whole lot of accessible user internal storage there underneath this runs
you can put application shortcuts customize it in that way it doesn't run widgets like a straight normal
and we've got recommendations based on that book also and this is a side-scrolling newsstand shows periodicals and
so if you want to access your library just tap here and there's your library right now
it doesn't really interrupt the flow too much or look something up and you can also Google and Wikipedia
we're using the vnn reader to look at it illustrations and we'll try it in landscape mode
you can't blow out the limit or anything like that and down here on our scrollable list you can see
she probably wouldn't play anything that's high resolution but nice another can do it so here we go
just fine you can also view JPEG images on the step using basically the gallery application basic playback controls here
I think you all know what pandora looks like and there it is complete with cover art
so here's the New York Times full web page by default which is nice responsive to scrolling
so you've got control of your browsing experience and now we'll check out our own website and watch some flash
it's just the casing is a little bit smaller but the nope surprising way is just a little bit less
six ounces versus fourteen point one both of them being a little bit on the heavy side
you're talking about a weighty book they're not too bad both of IPS displays and in bright light
we're gonna be doing a full comparison smackdown of these two so be sure to come back and watch that
Barnes & Noble for those of you were all about Kindle products and services well Amazon
five six viju here are some main features directly pulled from their site made feature number one
Wow looking at packaging if I wasn't mistaken I would think it's one of them comes with a pen case
okay and sorry about the camera shape and then we have cover for the actual tablet
please tell me if these camera angles are ok for the actual like product opening in such review um
where has all the things know if you can see this but there you one second ok
and it's a very shiny tablet obviously and what comes inside basically to packaging and the quick start
I guess if you were try it out it's very fast if you're like play something on there which
hopefully you liked this review and I'll see you tomorrow for Monday's first two episodes of the week oh
we went with the 32 gigabyte to put as many movies and books and things like that on there
this is only a hundred one hundred and thirty dollars depending on where you buy it
there there's they block you from all the apps that you wouldn't want your kids to use at that age
and that just shows what kind of apps you can use that blocks all the bad content
I'll leave a link in the description and if you found this video helpful please hit the like button
I was recently contacted by huion and they very kindly asked if I could try out their canvas
they just wanted to send the tablet along for me to give my honest review in this video
I was making sure to test that that's why I was working on a drawing with lots of hair
I think this tablet is great and I would definitely recommend it to any beginner or intermediate artists
I really hope you've enjoyed this video and I hope you've enjoyed watching me create this kind of Tokyo
they've really mean a lot to me if you'd like to follow my progress and see progress photos before
it's a fairly good sized tablet and I have kind of big hands so it's got plenty of working area
I got your hotkeys right here at the top and they're programmable and it also has I
slip it up under there and instantly digitize it that other way now comes with spare spare pen tip
angling me trying to work this because the tripods right here in front of me so
button is obviously the pin tip but this button right here is not just a single button
it's got a front part and a back part and you can set the buttons to be whatever you want
I'm using two screens on my computer and it does work with both screens and some little awkward
the whole tablet is just that one screen but if I was to quit yeah discard it
it's like a taskbar icon in Windows XP except windows 7 taskbar icons are kind of weird
it's a little easier to see but that's all you can do is you is draw
but you can see my cursor right here well where it actually is picking up where you're drawing
I'm pretty sure that's just a with or the compatibility with and windows 700 shoe touch revert
we go no keep changes if you do that or if you're only running one screen it beginneth works perfectly
I said campus free and it's very powerful layers all sorts of tools smudge tools pretty much
you don't draw the same old line no matter how hard you press down on this thing so right now
and you can even use the shortcut keys to even make moving around your programs and stuff even easier
you know you have all of these are programmable but as you can see they have you know webmail
Wacom was for example like the Wacom pen or the Wacom pin and touch if you want the touch feature
maybe the outline as you can see here but I mean I can't even fit it in the shot
here's where you choose your button but you can also choose your scope so for example
what's also cool is you can do screen ratio whoops okay full area screen ratio so
I have a sixteen by nine monitor and it automatically sizes it to 1600 by 900
edge is where it puts a little dead area all the way around it for example
I have to say you can also adjust your pressure in here and test it around and whatnot
uh and there's hot cells as well and you can set the hot cells to like
it says because the hardware different understands the hardware each place representative function has them to go down out
they haven't asked me to say anything in particular nor have they asked to pre-approve this video
it's got a 13 megapixel rear facing camera dual band wi-fi on here as well and a really nice premium
when you're sort of transitioning between orientations but overall it does actually perform very well indeed
it's actually very keenly priced a nice budget tablet but with a good quality ips display
the tablet is super thin and lightweight it only features one USB C port on the side for connectivity
the tablet size is 10 by 6 inches and it has an industry-leading 300 PPS report rate
this should help the performance of high speed pen strokes it features three different light modes and seven shortcut keys
EMR Pen features 8,192 pressure levels and tilts supported at 60 degrees but that's only supported on Mac OS now
both the top of the pen and the back of the pen are rounded all the way around
the overview this is information-gathering only except for this button which shuts off the LEDs on or off
now what's really nice they've given you pre-configured shortcuts for some of the main arc programs
I really appreciated that because I can never remember half the shortcut keys in the pen settings
because we're really looking to make sure we can get a decent gradient between three as you can see
you know from beginning to end and at the end of that circle you could see once again
I didn't get a chance to review the z2 is running the latest version of Android 4.4
US dollars but I have seen it on sale for one hundred and sixty one thing
there's about a 1 millimeter gap between the touch panel and the display itself and it is pretty noticeable
Network Bluetooth 4.2 USB type-c for charging and sync micro HDMI out a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
but you never know if you're gonna get an update from a company like this loading up
we'll head over to YouTube and check out a 1080p video as you can see it loads up pretty quickly
so video streaming on this device is going to be perfectly fine whether you want to use
these are 149 dollars and they go on sale for 99 all the time and on the left hand side
the m16 is perfectly fine but when we move over to something a little higher in like
I do have the graphic set to low and the framerate set to low but one of the biggest issues
so let's move over to Dead or Alive to 640 by 480 and we're around 43 to 45 fps
anybody um there are better tablets out there for cheaper unfortunately this mediatek X 27 CPU
oh ok drop the other piece there you go and then that's what it looks like from the back
I don't really like it that much because it almost never really does what it's supposed to do
good real fast and you could press this little button down there what these buttons do
it'll just take you back to whatever you're doing unless you're already on the home page
it'll take you to the home page volume down buttons on the screen volume up button on the screen
book has a tablet the TW 700 tablet and Micro Center is selling this for $59.99
but which is what you'd expect but there's a physical button that'll bring you back to the desktop
I should have a higher screen because screen because all my phones are more than that
but you know it's almost look how small these icons are it's almost too small to tap an icon
and now you have this right below and PC that runs actual Windows right legacy windows on
when what did you expect come on by its fifty nine dollars by five but you could plug in
let's turn it up and we can hear Bruno Mars and Mars Ronson funk it funkify just touch the screen
let me find the camera under why they don't save the money and just put a better front camera
you have to put a frank so just put a better front camera and don't put it
I feel like we're living in amazing times for $59 you can get a seven-inch tablet
you can run desktop app you can get an Android tablet $59 and it's not an Android
HDMI converter I could hook it up and we could see what the screen looks like
I don't think you should buy this for a camera it's probably adequate to do Skype
you probably want to stick just because of the size of the screen 7 inch screen
it's not gonna be that easy the other thing you can do is adjust the native resolution
the internal speakers are not very loud and sound better from the bottom of the will so
the power was disintegrating a little bit more than a percent a minute there is no doubt
the device plugged in at all times while in use that way it stays charged since apps
I downloaded a few hours of videos on the SD card however I will still say on hot days
wow it's like my christmas here and then you can put the rest of these in here i think
so yeah we're just going to uh uh watch a test um all right guys and yeah some of this
you got those nips over there different type of nips that you can use and you
and when they open up the package there were surprisingly they said it was pretty good quality
i really like the the weight of the pen the way it can feel pretty much
it would be one of my top choice if i have to use it to work on it professionally
it looks like a very very high quality products and they're not paying me for this
they will probably pick this one up if it's if the price point is is uh cheaper than welcome tablet
they were surprised that this tablet is really good and i was kind of surprised too
i promise you i will do an actual maybe tutorial or more painting that i'll do myself recently
all right guys well have a good rest of the day and enjoy the painting bye you
you'll see you have your data communication auto rotate and everything you would find on your hisense smartphone
they do have a lot of eye protection features that they're pushing because this is primarily for the fact
distance reminding ambient light and jitter so these things will do things like if there's not enough ambient light
meaning that this is not e-ink it looks like you're looking at e-ink but it's not
how does the ebook experience look on this device as you may ask you will see
i'll be showing off at the end of the video so please stay tuned for that
there are a couple ways you can go about this and each way is to your own personal comfort
a few starting off is going to be how i personally do comics and plan them
what's going on and what's happening before they do thumbnailing but sadly i am an extremely visual person
it's been a huge file in my drawing program and i create little rectangles for the pages
this is how it typically looks for me and oftentimes by the time i get to the actual page
the style doesn't change drastically if you have the time and patience to sketch an entire chapter then do so
i keep all my shading colors and my drawing program with the colors on hand and different lighting
i've had to remind myself of that while working on comic pages and many times tell myself it's fine
sorry so it's completely not portable at all like this this big boy chunky versus this stunning little bar
it's compatible with android so you can plug it in to your phone and other stuff huh
this tablet has been ever so patient with me because as a lot of you guys know
i was recently in the hospital so i couldn't get this video out as fast as i wanted to
but i don't believe it works on iphones from what i can see and i use an iphone and it
it didn't like me so i'm assuming it's just because of the the cord and the port
we have the beautiful stunning ten dollar tier of don the wanderer ravens strong killies nightmares rosemary
thank you for your patience and i hope you like the video and hey remember drink some water
the oyogu has several tablets that are pretty much this exact same configuration that have different memory configurations
you have to look at the sticker on the outside plastic to find out its CM 63
there's gonna be sticky cellophane all over that keeping it from getting scratched that looks nice and shiny
so it's a little thing to be noted now it has a crappy camera on the back of the front
let's turn it on the first time you boot your tablet up you'll need to login to the
I've already got mine all set up in case you're wondering I'm using the go launcher
you're gonna find that you can't install any more apps or you won't be able to update apps
they'll need to update the ROM so that it is a date of media ROM on other devices
now you'll notice here under frequency that this process are only clocks between 120 and 12 hundred megahertz now
battery monitor widget in the listing for this tablet is that the battery capacity should be 6500
you may want to contact the seller before purchasing and has to see a screenshot with an app
I'd say average for a tablet a really good well supported tablet like the HP touch
this could take anywhere five to ten minutes so be patient and don't do anything with the device now
we can see a list of all the apps we're going to authorize with root permissions here
it'll pop up this little menu here and ask you to allow or deny the app the root permissions
in addition be careful when purchasing these tablets some unscrupulous sellers will list the wrong information

I've always had a thing for Disney stickers and I love that they package them with this tablet
this one specifically actually solves a lot of issues right out of the gate for me with tablets
if you plug in the headphones you can listen individually or you can just listen via the tablet volumes
Disney now loaded in this tablet so you can click on that and you can access Disney now account
a few of my favorites have been in there that my kids read and the durability of this tablet
push and pull with your tablet but when they have a tablet that's all their own
it obviously works from the footage that you're seeing which is the tablet that I'm using
I'll have the name the title and probably on the screen but it has a ton of issues now
it's only a little bit bigger than my trackpad on my laptop if that is a good comparison
my fourth and final complaint is that it isn't compatible with certain versions of my art program now
maybe but if you're looking for a tablet that you use often don't buy this one
I would probably invest in the normal $60 Wacom tablet and I'll have the link for it in the description
but this one is a 10-inch version it's a it's a smaller tablet than the 11.6 inch to 702
same as the Q 702 and it has and the Q 572 has very similar screen brightness
do that's around about the same weight as an iPad for example but having a removable battery
rollouts it's not tire that consumers like an iPad or a galaxy or something like that
this is a tablet that firmly fits within the scope of corporate tablet rollouts and that's where Fujitsu really specialized
but the thing that makes that on-site warranty actually possible is the fact that you can see here
it's ooh technician can actually come out and open up the tablet and make repairs in the field
one more connection just to point out here is the the docking connector on the bottom
it's running 2 gigabytes but we can actually run up to 4 gigabytes of RAM in this tablet
a lot of corporates have gone with a 64-bit SOE deployment for Windows 7 and Windows 8
it's a little bit noisy but I guess most applications for this tablet are not going to be in
Landrum's this is not the kind of tablet that you'd buy to surf the the net on your couch
and there's very little lag there in using the pen and it works really well so the
this is in a hospital and a local council or a government agency with staffer out in the field
if you're an artist or an avid osoo player you probably heard of the bamboo tablets
that haven't been out of the box but they usually go for around two times the regular price
it comes with a pressure-sensitive pin with two programmable buttons and an eraser and removable pin tips
here's the little bag of accessories that came with the box inside of it and never mind those earbuds
it comes with three pin tips and a little removable while tool to help you remove the pin tips
Amazon as well and to replace the pen tip just simply sticking them with your hand
the overall size of this tablet is just about 13 inches by 8 inches and the active size
USB cable that's included which is very short and I do recommend get any Wireless can
I don't have it right now but I do recommend Ginter you can get it on Amazon
this thing has 1024 levels of pressure and not to mention this thing works perfectly for both
now you first setup you got an Internet install and CD which did not work right at all
I I will say that but doesn't fly plastic either so now the area that my hand is outlining now
it works almost exactly as if you're drawing on a sheet of paper or you're actually paint with a paintbrush
there's different programs you can use and it's punch levels of sensitivity as you can see
I am learning jessica's a lot better at this than I am but as you can see
Mouse to do all your normal functions on so overall I really like this drawing peg
Diamond tears and it also has a very nice rubbery grip material onto the side we have a trance
Start screen has a or your Start button has expanded out and you now have this kind of like
you know the whole thing there you can see all your different applications that are on your
Start menu but if you tap on the top left hand corner it gives you everything that's on your
well it's something that you just have to take some time to look at and it'll be easy to use
a lot of people will find useful in just use case scenario but this is on a 13.3 inch device
I think it works well especially for what you're doing on a tablet and the product productivity functions there but
I wish i I was there so right there in the center but easy to quickly
they'll forget to like and share this video subscribe to the channel and always enjoy entertainment
I believe this is a QuickStart guide or something and this is a warranty certificate over
the audio quality is reasonably good for an entry level tablet although distortion is a bit of a problem
I'm gonna play a bunch of funny people videos just to give an idea what the speakers sound like
so that's basically what you expect from a entry level tablet that being said this is a tablet
that's great for people who want to do simple stuff like media consumption watching YouTube videos
not exactly very good in low light but still just good enough to capture some details
I'm doing a video test using the legal pad 10 and as you can see here

Seidman we've got not one but two new 8-inch tablets from Amazon to check out today
Fire HD 8 and we got in the HD 8 and the HD 8 plus and
we'll take a look at what makes these two tablets different from each other and how they perform now
they also both have 32 gigabytes of storage in their base configuration which is pretty generous for a low-cost tablet
the tablet down on the center of it it will most of the time begin charging itself
surprisingly this has stereo speakers on it so if you are watching content that has stereo to it
it's certainly a lot better than some of the generic tablets that I've looked at my one
and how prior versions of this tablet were configured but the camera is not going to be here
this is common to both of the tablets that Amazon is offering in this HD 8 line
there is a version of the tablet with special offers and one that is more expensive without special offers
what special offers means is that you'll see some average sizing subtly sprinkled about the interface here
so the most obvious one is the one you'll see on the lock screen so you can see here
it's got an ad for subscription boxes when I unlocked a tablet and lock it again
I think you can get two of these for what one of those Samsung tablets costs so
I'm back in the world that I was playing the Sun is setting now but on this one
we can jump into the web browser and maybe go to the nasa.gov home page here
AC wireless so you will be able to take advantage of faster wireless networks and I found
I don't expect much of a difference between the two gig and the three gig model for web browsing
guy he had about 40 different participants in that zoom call and the tablet handled it
well you just have to deal of course with an 8-inch screen as you're watching it
it supports the l1 level for DRM the Widevine DRM so that was good and altogether
let me know what you thought down in the comments below and until next time this is LAN and Simon
oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy so hello everyone and welcome to another come on unboxing video
I think I got to run back package because this looks like a mouse but I'll leave
all we have some spare lips if you had a dragon kind but I was wondering since this
I can't wait to play with this and they suddenly realize they cannot drag with it
BPM streaming skill if you had a 500 K play around you are looking for the tablet then
oh we have a battery as well stylus pen look but Pat has all these information on it
you can't even play this game it up with the mouse you can only try this
I haven't played with this tablet for like 10 minutes and I can already do this
Pro 13 and it is a graphics tablet lady and Rara but it has a screen on it
I think we're talking 200 300 pound here first impressions of the box and everything is
and when it was shipped me it was in perfect condition so yes the box is nice
so it's corn in the box like this and a protective it's very slick so far
and then obviously got the plug adapters stand and all the bits to plug in so
I'm just gonna install this software because it's finished downloading and we're gonna plug this very in okay
Oh wiser so what just double-check that that's a little something you can bear in mind
I've plugged it in and I'm used to using the 27-inch mac screen which is a 4k
I'm gonna offer a new layer one thing I have noticed already is compared to my Wacom
I tell you what we should probably test out the pen sensitivity the pressure sensitivity should
undo undo undo these are really really handy haven't shot cuts like these oops clear string
I'm a smaller monitor and you're happier working on a smaller display with full version of Photoshop on that
secondly don't expect the display to be like the 4k Retina display because it is not
I don't know whether it's because my display settings set up but the initial unboxing plugging it in
if you're you see using certain hotkeys then the function is there you get for taking use the other
sensitivity was beautiful like seriously lovely pressure sensitivity gives you the option to adjust it for you as well so
and if it's your first graphics tablet and you're looking at what to get this might be for you
iPad pro came out but the price difference a dramatically different the iPad pro 12-inch which is a similar screen
is my price point this all this and also do you want to be able to run full version
I hope this reveal review video was ok and I covered as much ground as I could
Wacom Intuos and the fact that can draw on the screen whilst it's plugged into my computer
this tablet it means the world and and I will see you in the next video
as i pointed out earlier are actually on the on the on the right side here all three of them
this remarkable tablet is by far the best thing i have purchased to boost my workflow and let me explain
so the chances are you're probably going to end up going directly to the remarkable website
so keep an eye on the website and i'll leave a link to that in the description below now
i never thought i'd say this but the battery life on this thing is insane at one point
the tablet does have security features such as a pin to log in but this alone has some issues
and of course if you make a mistake there is also an eraser on there too
Picasso tab drawing tablet which is an ugly affordable item in the market but is it worth buying and using
we haven't even unboxed it yet so stick around and we'll get right into it okay
forget the unboxing forget seeing the product actually being used all right look for the timestamp in the description below
select my Wacom Bamboo tab that's what I usually draw with here on my computer and on my channel
I think that would be even better but I also have an iPad pro that I draw on and comparatively
then it's not top of the line screen resolution another thing is like the camera has a built-in camera
it doesn't uphold detail very well in low-light situations you're not buying it for the camera
the workaround is that you need to draw from this orientation that is with the camera at the bottom
you're likely gonna just have it on your lap or lay it on the table flat anyway
or if you want to just you're on the road you want to travel you know
I do some plane flights so I can see something like this being used in Airport just sketching like that
and of course it's gonna do all the other normal tablet stuff however is there better things on the market
but you have to remember that that is like eight times more expensive than this guy so keep that in
also let me know if you pick it up and what your thoughts about it was and until
uninstall all tablet drivers from your computer and keep all antivirus program and drawing program closed
it comes with a dual core cortex a9 MCU chip and you can definitely see that excess
especially when you do things with like the accelerometer it's actually little pay twenty bucks more
I have the power button up at the top with the audio jack next to it
I believe that equals out to 12 ounces exactly and it also has a really decent battery
yeah yeah now if we listen to you some music for example this is a little bit different
it does not get you that in my space like I as a speakers for example price
it's also now considered a little bit old because it has 4.1 jelly bean instead of 4.3
you can't really get any good photos out of this with just a front facing camera now
it's cheap that's a hundred forty nine dollars a cheap even the viewing angles though are really bad on it
I think people should spend all that always tell people this that cheap tablet is gonna be a bigger expense
I hate it when companies put bloatware on there the cons of course the terrible screen
I bet you can guess hmm hmm even in half the price probably don't buy it
also you'll see her all the time on a lot of our shows really appreciate it
I don't yes Shelly you play poker didn't win some money over the weekend in Vegas
cuz it is my first one so like it'd probably be more harsh in it because my first one so
if you're like really gonna move this tablet is that these are not the best they definitely work
so yeah but that's basically it and yeah the pros about this for these cool aspects
there's usually three three means one if your thumb mutters make sure you're on the right
click on it next to the like where all your tops are like right there right there
hopefully it was good enough in you guys and short enough because the no laughs guess
please let me get you on discoveries before the before spring break because that is what
you have your power and sleep button you have your volume rocker and then a microphone on the other side
the screen like i said is eight inch 1920 by 1200 ips display and this is a good display
if you're the type that likes to take pictures with your tablet this will be just fine
they get pretty loud and they should be loud enough to use in just about any setting
this tablet runs android 10 pi has three gigabytes of ram 32 gigabytes of internal storage again
actually in comparison to the amazon fire hd eight that i reviewed a couple months ago
king sa8 there are just a few things that i wish were a little bit better
okay people so this is a like like a complete review officer review of the other learn book learning book
screen screen is touchable movable and then also the keyboard okay so as you guys can see
yeah so you type in so as you can see we placed in the the wi-fi password password
so from whatever but it's workable so you can see taking on the load and you can see
the wi-fi bar is full so hoping there's another wi-fi problem so so for the top
we're not sure whether where the speaker is located cause we gonna get today on the side
that's above 300 and i'm not gonna approximately 300 us u.s usd so in ec that will be
yeah so that's a lot of money for one little button your personal inspire so we will not do that
after that we heard all the we heard a volume so you can go view it for yourself
it's not as we say it's not the fastest so it took so long to load
so we're gonna press background book again complete this process so you see it automatically signs here
so yes so you can see the box load up so whatever subject area you're doing
physics are from four and five physics from one and two different books like same books but different contexts
yeah that's the content where the topic on whatever you're doing with a teacher yes like whatever so so
yes yes it's load up to the book so as you can see as a teacher
okay there's also pictures there's also pictures like like a normal textbook be done picture character or something
yes so it's it's it's like a normal textbook just in here so that feature is very great
it's a very futuristic feature from the books that carry on in bag book so yes we signed you know
yes so it's the same dream drive from same ordinary drive like it shows your personality first now
there's no there's there's not so much like apps to see so i'm gonna try us
it's not working so we'll try another feature try another so we want to go on app store
okay people so this is all all that we have for all the apps we review everything we know
what's we know what it's obvious can calculator so this is a keyboard instead of keyboard built a very
yeah we don't know if if it will activate doing the zoom classes but there's no zoom
you wanna have a a loan book just for just because they can access books in it
you need to use the internet to access things so that yeah yeah so for me
we were told that well before the thing they saw that said that it was actually free was well
okay so yeah so yeah so this is a this is a review so to make it in the video
you can be notified when a new video is posted because the video might be very important
this is this one here so i hope you enjoyed the review of the the one the one learn
The Gaomon company sent me this tablet for review so I want to tell you my opinion about this product
I feel comfortable when I use it and now let's talk more about the tablet itself
The tablet is really nice to look at M10k support the left and right hand mode
This tablet is middle sized but I can say that it's a bit bigger than my tablet
Previously, it's wasn't included in the set and I'm so glad that it's finally was added
The surface of the tablet scratches pretty quickly, but I'm sure this is a problem with most tablets
It’s not necessary, but I really love it because it’s much easier to work on the tablet with this glove
how this tablet works and this card shows a website where you can easily download a drivers
After restarting the computer you can find options to change the pressure sensitivity and the buttons on the tablet
If you are interested, you can find more information about this product on the official website
just have a a re-jig um i could even move to the other side when my mum will sit
um which i put out on instagram and it seems to be like for everybody so yeah where
um i've made notes but i just need to like familiarize myself with what i want to chat about
so it's going to be this weekend so i have a lot of prep to do for it
i did a zoom call last week um i had to wear them but i felt so stupid wearing them
i couldn't bring myself to part with them um so anyway when they got in touch
oh it's gonna be good because i have two zoom calls today so i can actually use them
grandma here doesn't know what she's doing right okay so this is what they were explaining about
i won't say the company but um his dog fit his ears so i'll have to show him
okay if you tap it once it it's play and pause if you tap it twice
so i've actually been given a deal as well i've been given an offer to share with you
okay let's pause princess and the frog because i'm getting distracted so yeah i think this is a great offer
i asked everybody um if they could hear me okay and they said yeah sounds great
i need to kind of upload that so people can watch it if they missed um right
it's now 10 past two and i haven't done any work i've done a zoom call
it's actually five to four already five to four and i've had my lunch and i'm back over here
i'm just going to be sat here like watching a bit of youtube and doing this
um and the good thing is i never removed the last market page from my website
but um i'm gonna have to stop soon because my zoom call is happening in 25 minutes
so let me give you like a quick run through of what i've been sent hang on
i do have some in my scrapbook already that i've been sent um and like this
i just want to say thank you so much to sophie for sending me these things
but um please go and give sophie a follow and that would mean the world okay
so like i said i will leave details below of how you can get them with the discount code
i don't work on tuesdays so i will be back on wednesday and i will see you next week
we'll just animate two of those rectangles cause i'm lazy and i don't wanna do the whole thing
this guide helps me keep the head solid and consistent and avoids making her look like
i just try to keep in mind about hair gravity and apply it to her hair though
i did this when i was like 11 so i think you could do it too
pen tablet is definitely a lot more spacious and comfortable unlike that into us with only four express key buttons
since it's not too big it makes it a lot easier to bring around with me in 2020
so yeah there you have it so we've now reached the end of the video and thanks for watching wait
any dollar helps and you'll even get to see work in progress shots of my animations
but here we're going to get an headphone jack out for the people that want to use an headphone
take consideration if you even want to buy the tablet like this to make a phone call
not every sim card is basically supported and of course we can add the ncf card
when brands no kind of weird in my opinion eight gigabytes of ram 128 gigabyte storage
i couldn't find information regarding the storage but if that was a lie i would not be surprised
this is what we're going to video the next generation of retro emulation consoles from our friends from china
if they are still selling this kind of tablets i want to thank you for watching
so we'll dive straight in so it's a great color so these are just some sim cards
you don't need to go hunting around for a case that'll fit it a nice leather effect case
you've got two speakers got your volume control power button microphone headphone jack on the top
cable got your power brick standard uk power brick there you also get a bluetooth mouse
it's actually a really good case to get included with it slot out for the camera
there i'll have a quick quick look at that so i'd say the case works absolutely fine
obviously you're not going to get amazing quality 4s for the price but it works fine
if you liked the video give it a like subscribe to the channel share around and thanks a lot
I've ever really done on this channel before but as most of you enjoy animation anime
the screen itself is eleven point six inches and the display area is 256 times hundred and forty four millimeters
I did definitely notice when drawing once you download the driver from the site which helps you calibrate
the paper screen protector was really nice and lots of functions with buttons and commands to set up
they'd allow me to keep the tablet that I reviewed and being the cheapskate that I am
it just means that the tablet itself might not feel secure and firm on a stand
I said that it might not feel secure on a stand so at the end of the day
God [ __ ] what I'm trying to say is that your spinal cord will be in great pain
a couple of friends told me that sometimes tablet drivers seem to conflict with one another but
I don't know why I would want to use my old tablet when I have a new one
of is the slight color difference between my tablet and my monitor and minut blurriness of the pixels
I'll be showing off some speed drawers and random art that I put together with this thing
I just see this as a upgrade rather than a good start does that make sense
which will give you a link for that also has the tool video and how we how
I don't even know how much the replacements cost so I wanted to go over with the stylus
it's much easier to use and much more functional and again this is not a tutorial
Alliance and that is its own monster so I need to keep track of all of these activities
now let's say just to give you an idea of how this functions for me let's say that
she knows exactly what I want and so what I can do then is this is the share button
I can put flyer edit in here so I can send it as three different types of files
I always just send it back as a PDF so I have all this ready to go
I want to move this sheet of paper out of quick sheets into another folder now
let's take a look so on a movie so it asked me move out where do
shoot it over if I have a note that needs to be in two different folders
I like to keep things pretty much in date order and you can see the way that I use that
come get you some cute little smile but she if you need let cause everybody needs some love
my eyes feel free my dreams crush feel free so guys my dreams sails feel free my dreams
basically just feels like you're holding a chunk of glass the back it's got this really shiny material to it
titles below it and the same links over there so it's just how this new operating system lays out
where like all your recent activity your books and apps open your images everything shows up on here
you can't really remove any of this stuff all these things right here so your new items appear right here
and then you'd normally just look like this with your apps here on the home section
these are all the pre-installed apps all the way up until Riptide that's where I started installing apps
it can adjust the line spacing spacing and margins and the brightness each is used to the system brightness
you can go ahead and adjust how many hints you want as you can see right there
so that's just kind of a feature for those learning language or some kids learning three
you've also got the word run or flashes of word in the center of the screen
so you got the usual kindle features hold down on word you get the notes highlights the dictionary lookup
get the translation the week Wikipedia entry you can just launch the web browser by tap on that
scrolled in to the sides here to fit to wit the text extra looks quite good
I mean I'm looking forward to trying it out and seeing how well that works so right
I have opened it before but put it all back nicely for the purpose of this video
it's got a nice build quality doesn't feel too light or anything that feels reasonably solid
you can imagine it could feel a little bit more solid but it's a nice a nice shape and size
I'm assuming that you can just have it connected via cables off like I guess off mic that
it should allow me to be a lot more sensitive in my in my drawing and designing and stuff
I guess I'll find out if it is then on some things like on the Mac
I won't actually need it because I've got bluetooth it's got bluetooth going but we'll see
they're all their selection of replacement nibs in there as much survived as I've used a welcome
I I guess for doing this stuff I use is it's all for like texture and 3d models and maybe
I'll just leave it as default and have it as a left and right click but again
I don't think it does because it's rounded in a weird way so I think that would be strange
I think it'd be strange if that was the eraser because it's kind of did focus there
there's not any anything any CD's in there you know some reason it made it look like a CD
we're always out of date by the time you come to use them and they had issues so
I guess you can use any one if this breaks and hopefully it doesn't break it
so you've got to move the pen a bit more to get across the screen now
I guess that's probably if people ever ever go from like a medium up to a large into us
there was no no delay in the latency when I was drawing and that was I was drawing while recording
I was drawing so it's good and I was always kind of worried about if it was
can you can comfortably hold it in your fingers won't slip down the end so it's quite happy with that
Wacom pen and that but that's just I think that's just a kind of something that maybe makes it feel
the quality of the pen feels different because it's lighter but it doesn't doesn't appear to affect how
some of the into us once you can you can have the rotate to take it
on pretty short you can view and it all picked up as well but listen this pen
I've got my workstation at home and I use it there so within one place I expect
they're adding features to the tablets too to bring them up in line with the with the with
the screen tablets again also now using the battery free pens so I can imagine a lot of people
I thought I'd just sketch some ideas for some wood fell creatures while I was doing it
here we go starting right off at number 10 we have the Asus memo pad 7
this incredible 7-inch tablet comes in white black and other colors and has an unbelievably clear
all the information and pricing on these amazing tablets number nine is the dragon touch 7 inch
because there's no need for you to spend a lot of money on a tablet here at number 8
the only difference between this and name-brand 10-inch tablets is that you have a slightly lower camera quality
go to easybib.com forward slash top - 10 - Android - tablets where you can get more pictures
all the information and pricing on these amazing tablets number 6 is the amazing and vidya shield gaming tablet
this becomes the very best tablet for gaming and even as you run a high-powered games on the tablet
but you'll be viewing it on a Super AMOLED display that has 2560 by 1600 resolution
you'll also find yourself for the fingerprint scanner for security and an unbelievable eight core processor
so it lets you play games while doing things like watch movies and browse the web
now go to easy vidcom forward slash top - 10 - Android - tablets where you can get more pictures
compared to many of the others we have looked at over the last couple of months
tablets are but it's good enough given the price point especially if you're looking for something
a nice large keys nicely spaced apart so very nice to type on really nice travel on them too
they do feel a little cheap and thin but it really isn't bad to type on with some real again
the distance the key goes down when you push it is really nice and among the nicest
click and the right click so if you click on this side you get the left
scroll so you do have that option available to you so a decent trackpad again for the price
you'll get out of the internal drive on it but you do have that available to you
it's kind of odd that they didn't go as one of those little paper clip buttons versus this
we can go fullscreen on this too and just see how that performs there so these
that might surprise you but just don't have high expectations for that going in but one thing
this channel is brought to you by the generosity of my patreon supporters if you find the channel helpful
YouTube you play as little as a dollar a month visit lang pd / patreon to learn more
so I would highly recommend going out and getting one of these probably get a different stand
I'm gonna let you guys know what's good about the tablet what is kind of a and what
Pro so the price for this tablet is $250 and for a screen tablet that's super affordable
we'll get to the tablet itself in a bit but let's see what else is in here
it's it feels heavier up here so it's a little top-heavy but the rubber feels nice
its case for safekeeping for now and is that it that feels like it so pretty nice packaging
XP pen a lot compared to like hooey on or something like that so now let's get to it
let's um let's actually work on this tablet here actually before we do that before we do that
let's figure out how to set up this stand so it was confusing me at first
okay that popped out there we go you just got to pop it out with a little bit
that's awesome actually it features eight shortcut keys on the tablet and it has one roller wheel
yeah like I said the pen feels very light and kind of flimsy selecting and dragging feels good
click scroll up right click scroll down or I can do shortcuts ctrl alt shift or Windows
it's got a really tactile feel it doesn't feel like mushy like it does on my
you know it's got a calibrate button but I'm gonna choose not to calibrate it actually
I can so that's the thing I can't do on my other monitor or my other screen tablet
my laptop and this screen are displaying the same thing and I seem to have lost the pen
it's working fine so another setting over here is how soft or how hard your brush is
let's see so the first one opens up our tablet settings which is what we're in right now
and you get a little notification down here at the bottom telling you what the hot key is doing
if you don't know in most drawing programs moves around the canvas right cool the fourth one is control Z
the fifth one is zoom in and then zoom out for the sixth one for the seventh
yeah even if I have my pen to an extreme angle like this it still tracks it pretty well
the only thing the only complaints are really just you know you have to connect it to an extra computer
I feel like well I don't know I don't think if I drop this on the ground it would break
I wouldn't do it on purpose but yeah it feels like it would hold up to a fall or two
it definitely feels like plastic against a rubber kind of what I was saying so it's a bit gummy
I'm Aaron Rutten and in this video I'm going to be reviewing the Parblo Mast 22 display tablet.
Quick disclaimer. This video is sponsored by Parblo, but as always, the opinions in this video are my own.
Now let's go a bit deeper into some of the features and specifications of the Parblo Mast 22.
The Parblo Mast 22 has a matte film pre-applied to the screen and that matte film has a paper-like feel.
It does not feel slippery to draw on, like some of the other Cintiq alternatives I've tried.
The feel is nice, but the screen protector itself does not stick very well to the tablet.
There is not an eraser on the pen and the pen does not support pen tilt.
The cursor also strays a bit when you move near the left and right edges of the screen.
Since many slider bars are located here, that may make it difficult to grab the handle.
I appreciate the thin design of this tablet. It's seven millimeters thick at its thinnest point.
There's also a handy 1/8 inch audio output jack for headphones or speakers on the back of the tablet.
You can do this by going into your display settings and changing it from duplicate to extended.
Once you've done that, you may also want to adjust the UI scaling for the Mast 22
It doesn't offer quite as much as many of the other display tablets do, but it worked well enough.
One thing I didn't like about the control panel is that it opens automatically when you start windows.
Nevertheless, it does a good job of keeping your tablet stable when you're drawing on it.
i'm going to talk about how i set up my camera in order to do zoom calls and take notes
if you guys if you're not subscribed to him yet on youtube i highly recommend it
i'd rather just turn my video off but right now what i'm doing is i'm using my iphone
so you're going to get your device ip from the app on your iphone go to dev47apps.com
make sure your device ip this will change from session to session sometimes so pay attention to this
i don't know why it's awkward that he's in like a polo shirt with buttons and shorts
reduces the amount of space between the glass that your pen is actually hitting and drawing on and the screen
it's edge class and that etch glass goes edge to edge now when you list them out like this
these do sound like big trade-offs but in terms of specs every they're 16-inch pen display
they're perfect there's no fiddling there's no stroke smoothing that you need to add to it
I want the lines to look and feel when I'm drawing slow lines fast lines keeping a consistent pressure
I want it to now the biggest difference between this and the Cintiq Pro is that parallax
it's much easier to do that on the Cintiq pros because it has that bonded screen
I don't know if there is another 16 inch tablet that has tilt on the pen
boo-yan has been slowly adding it to some of their devices but we haven't seen a full rollout yet
it's luxurious to have that much space but it's not always practical for every desk setup
if you flip this thing over along the back you're gonna see that there are some legs that pop up
there are four holes back there and I believe that those four holes are a VESA standard size
you'd like another big difference between this and the pro versions is that there is no USBC attachment in fact
you got the pen you got the power adapter doodad you got the combo cable alright so
I don't think that it came with any kind of stand or extra nibs with the pen
I don't know how widespread those problems were by the time I started using the pros and testing them out
I didn't have any problems installing the drivers personally so it seems like if there were any widespread problems
it makes sense to kind of tear their product line a little bit and capture some of that market
so if you don't even comments or questions let me know down below in the comment section that is all
i'm drawing one of my viewers original characters and reviewing the veekvk 1200 pen display so
basically i needed something to draw for this tablet review and since there are so many oc submissions
i thought i'd draw one of those but before we take a look at the oc
we have the quick start guide and a little card telling us where we can get the drivers
also they give you a ton of nibs my goodness they are very generous with the pen
i'm not sure why you get two pens but it is nice to have an extra one
if the tablet came with some kind of stand for this review i'll be using a stand
they do not give you an adapter if it does need to be plugged into a wall
my laptop is able to power the tablet it does seem to drain the battery a little bit
so i do have more to say about the tablet but first let's take a look at the character
i will be drawing so this character was created by fluffy ramen the character's name is he sal
i didn't pick a gotcha character because like i said i just posted a gotcha character video so anyways
back to the tablet when i was setting up the tablet i did have to recalibrate the monitor
the tablet wouldn't let me recalibrate it unless i had it set to extended displays also recalibrating
i clicked on the wrong thing because the cursor was in a slightly different spot than my mouse
i then went around and added where i wanted the strands of hair to get some more light
at first i thought working on the small of a tablet would be kind of troublesome
the medium has a live area of eight point five by five point three inches the new
the top isn't quite as practical as say having them along the side like the intros
they are calling it a 4 K pen instead of saying it has 4096 levels of pressure
a little bit of pressure gets wider at a consistent rate it is a very smooth feeling pen
it's also a little narrower than a lot of the styluses that come with other tablets
it takes a little bit of time for your eyes to adjust to looking at the screen
even if you're not drawing that's just another thing that's gonna get you acclimated to using the pen now
mostly like the screen devices if you want to see a rundown of those reviews and check out my favorites
it's hard to describe what I'm doing but if you know what I'm talking about you're like hey
if you're giving the small it's about $80 now that you can get something for about half that price
the starting price for the small is a little higher than it used to be like
it comes with some software you got three applications to choose from but depending on which tablet you buy
it has let me show you the back of this g tap so this is p thousand
wow okay this is that it just all falls down and uh earphones charger and the overwatch charger
i'll put this tab and now it opens because it was power off see guys look g tap touch me
look 600 points cool and if you like my video please like share and subscribe and bye bye
Amazons fire HD 10 kids edition is a tablet with a lockdown and fairly easy to navigate operating system
it's biggest size will make it fairly uncomfortable for younger children to get a hold of the tablet
even for adults it also has a microSD slot to expand your storage up to 256 gigabytes
this tablet is as I said a 7-inch tablet it does has have a resistive touch screen
it's not capacitive so you do need to push down and use your fingernail to move through the device
it is an armed 11 processor like the Augen gent us but the Augen was only running at 600
this is one gigahertz however on quadrant which many people use to kind of rate their Android devices
power this only scores a 198 which is substantially lower than most Android smartphones and other tablets
as far as that scoring goes this scores a 198 so this device is not a powerhouse by any means
it's not bad it doesn't really slow the device down or anything like that it's pretty usable like
I did update my device when I did receive it an issue that I now have is
there is some talk that a Black Friday Toys R Us will have this device for 139
there are some issues that need to be worked out in this to my personal device
information is also an issue but for what it can do it does do it nice
maybe they'll have more updates and that'll be good this is Chris Garcia with my tablet life
make sure y'all like come in and subscribe to my lair man and it's gonna be a good video man
it started alright so when you press the power button it's gonna load up a picture right
you can save that picture to whatever you want to set it to mine is my car personally

this is the default page by the way you got the friend of the car so
I just dropped a video 35 minutes ago man by the way so we were gonna go to
yada whatever you want to do now if you press the top right corner right here
I'm gonna show y'all we didn't lunch it mean in a minute so I guess up
my time is like a hour because of the saving thing but you know yes she was going on
we're now moving away so it's not gonna go nowhere up here you know you got
but they got a little satellite button right there and I believe you can do that me
I never really looked into it because I have a tablet so I know I can get
DVR a 360 camera now mine isn't going to show because I'm currently swapping out my cameras right now
you can install the launcher on any Android there's any any Android tablet and a larger
I have to cut the car off and cut it back on and then they'd be straight it reconnect
I have updated in a minute which I see the little mussed and pop up right there
that camera automatically pop up just like any other car so you good with that and there be it man
I found a mood board on Pinterest and decided to create a character based on that mood board
there are 12 buttons for you to personalize to help you make your workflow smoother and more efficient
I didn't know what to program them all to so what I did was the eyedropper tool the brush
the entire tablet minus the button side is a drawable surface area on all the tablets that I've used
it's the same as the tablet that I currently use so there is no difference there
but it was underneath the tablet above all the customizable buttons there is an LED display
the easiest way to do it without the touch ring is to click one of the buttons on the pin
all of the cons other than the pin grip were all based on my previous experience with other tablets
I think it is safe to say that it is tableau week so without further ado
it's full of bubbles and dust particles right under it and it seems like it's a pretty good script
we got a front facing camera and on the back we actually have just a black blob
we get the magnetic dock for the optional keyboard that we'll be taking a look at in just a bit
getting in the way of the keyboard you can easily disable it with a single key
and finally this is how it clips on it basically clips on with the magnetic dock on the bottom
all right here we go so we are getting about 78 77 T 1 FPS 70 FPS
and here's what it looks like right now it looks pretty good obviously but the FPS is not very stable
now what's not running at full speed is of course the Wi-Fi because we're connected to 2.4
it does have some major light bleed issues and you can see in the bottom right corner
we can get 4 hours and 20 minutes of video playback at 1080p full brightness using VLC
it's a really immensely touchpad definitely don't recommend it overall this is going for around $45 or so
This is their advanced base, so it has power built into it, it also has two USB ports.
Standard magnetic stripe reader is built into the side for doing old mag stripe type processing.
but i'm also going to talk to you guys about how you can win this very tablet
so let's get into it but first and welcome back so like i said before the intro
we're going to go ahead and take a look at this xp pen 22 inch second generation
yes this is one of the kinds of drawing tablets that you need a computer to run this device on
i could take these four screws off and connect the back of the screen to my ergo arm and just
if you're looking at your screen like this all you have to do is put your hand in the middle
i'm not 100 sure if you can change those out or not but they definitely this
so feel free to click that again if your ink or your paint isn't being brought out okay
i know that there's a lot of people that are really geeked out on this type of stuff
i'm i'm excited that this is this much better drawing experience than i thought it would be
being interrupted or feeling clunky right so wacom is notorious for being a little bit on the higher price
leave me your instagram or your twitter handle in the comments section of this video on may 1st 2021
if you like this video please give it a thumbs up if you know anyone else
one that we really liked and deemed one of the best of 2013 now with their latest offering
Sony keeps things mostly as sleek as before but continues the evolution of the Xperia line
Xperia z2 tablet much like the name implies the Xperia Tablet is supposed to be much like its smartphone counterparts
I'll say the bezel around the screen you are able to grip the tablet pretty easily
larger screen with a resolution of 1920 by 1200 and a respectable pixel density of 224 pixels per inch now
Sony's own enhancements of the live color LED which adds extra colors to the already established
the slight stutter when moving between apps and even somewhat during basic tasks like swiping through home screens nothing
of course which has always been the case with Xperia devices the marquee feature is the IP certification
but my unit did not come with the headphones that are needed for that to happen
life is supported by a lot of power saving features but also that's 6,000 milliamp hour unit
you can't use the full resolution if you want to be able to shoot at 16 by 9
at which point you will have to use 5 megapixels instead picture quality thus is passable at best
what has always been at least to me a success of the Xperia UI is that well
interfaces you pull down on the left and get a look at your notifications and then on the right
the recent apps screen houses the main edition of the small apps ultimately only sometimes useful overlays
under the settings areas you are able to personalize the user interface using a number of different downloadable
so if you're gonna pay the premium price for this tablet right here it's probably because of
well then you do still have one of the best median consumption devices here after all
When you have a tablet that long you learn some interesting things a review won’t cover.
Speaking specifically as a 2D animator/illustrator there is a point where the tablet is too big.
I don’t care how good your palm cancellation tech is, I can get around it with my chunky hand meat.
I haven’t tried any other monitor arms, but the official Wacom Flex monitor arm is heavy duty.
I don’t how long ¾ inches of Ikea particle board will survive the toothy jaws of clampiness.
But then Windows updated and pitched us all back into the fiery pits of hell again.
When I turned it on in the morning it took a couple minutes to fade in to regular colors.
The fan was such a big complaint that Wacom made a firmware update that allows you to change
Twice. The remote still shows a signal, but the tablet doesn’t recognize it anymore. And then… and then!
The 27QHD used to require a power off and on when this box appeared. The 24 doesn’t.
I’ve clean-installed and reprogrammed my express remote keys so many times I have a text file of my shortcuts.
And if your program is behaving weird, try toggling your display settings so they don’t resize to 100%.
I did intend to have another video in between but then I didn't do that so today
I'm reviewing the XP pen star g9 6 0 which is the first XP pen tablet
I received this for free and I haven't been paid to say anything positive if I like it
you get it from so that makes it an extremely well priced tablet and one of the cheapest
which mean that you can use this tablet with different devices such as Android phones and tablets
Windows ink on or off and choosing whether you want the tablet to be used in left-handed or right-handed mode
it's thin but it doesn't feel flimsy or like it's gonna snap it's about the same depth as my iPad
I don't know if I'm missing something or being stupid but I'm not sure what that's for
I didn't notice any blips where the Pens stopped recognizing input or any inconsistencies in my lines
like it's not so smooth that the pen will slide around but it doesn't catch up either
I use a lot of hand cream especially in the winter so that might be partly down to me
this can override your tablet settings and disable your pressure sensitivity which is very annoying as you can imagine so
I can't speak for the longevity of it but I actually plan to keep this tablet whereas with the others
I genuinely enjoyed using this tablet and I'm extremely fussy about my tools to recap in terms of cons
I'm drawing and I will be doing a full video about them as part of my D&D series
they recently leveled up to eldritch night and have been having a great time casting the light
Tantra and leading the way through the woods with a glow-in-the-dark Warhammer I loved Rita bits
there's so much fun to play and I'm really happy with how this painting came out
now I know a lot of you guys are probably saying something like wow snow ler snads
I'm probably not going to make too many of these unless you know you guys want me to
so this is the tablet it's a Gaga Galman PD 1560 Galman stands for Garfield and Odie Mondays
I guess I'll start off with all the cables he get because you get a lot of cables
it's not as complicated as it looks but you know you got you got your input thingies your
you got this you got this plug got the USB in this thing it works pretty well
now you can like program these with settings on your keyboard and I've messed around with them a little
About section the stylist settings the key settings and as you can see the function works pretty
the pen itself will like disconnect for a little bit that might be my computer or the tablet
take your computer screen and just put it on the tablet like your mouse works as a normal
and of course mspaint is winning so here we have some suggestions a painting of Bob
I don't know let's do Steven universe for because that's uh that's the only thing I'm really familiar with
I must say that the line work does not have much to be desired in this one
it really reminds me of those like doodles that everyone's really into these days with just the little monsters everywhere
I feel like he's got a bit of a different color scheme but I really like it it says
but it had 1024 levels of pen pressure sensitivity guys for this to have 8,192 levels of pen pressure
Quick Start Guide the warranty and return policy this glove that you wear while you draw
I might check it out and try and see how it feels while drawing with this tablet today
yeah your USB cord and finally of course the tablet itself which is nice really light and compact so
so let's go ahead and get started so one thing that's different from the tablet that I usually use
like right here and definitely around this area right right about here in this area right here and so
I'm just gonna fill it in by hand so it takes a little longer doing it by hand
so it'll be over top of everything and I can just add like this weird little gap
Ross drawls he uses this tool a lot and I love it just to add touches of effects
this one's really fancy so this is gonna be the last you see of any boxes
I really like this for someone just getting started out and then we have the Wacom Intuos
so this is kind of the the mid-level model this is probably your best value and this is probably what
I'll end up going with so this is just kind of mid sized very nice quality
but this is really meant to be used in your office and really not yet to be taken anywhere
the one is gonna be the most portable one although the Intuos is pretty much the same
this little cloth strap here so that you can actually keep your pin to your tablet
so that's this really nice metal base and you use that on your desk to hold it so really simple
the pro really developed to be used on a desktop and not to be taken travel with you
it feels great in your hand and just the positioning of it and everything just feels amazing
it doesn't have a good feel to it and the buttons are kind of this cheap plastic key
most people would be using the opposite orientation but this allows your hand to rest on this surface
you have shortcuts just for that application so then under pin for this bottom button what
so it's a really easy way to get exactly the brush that you want now the other thing
I set this to a keystroke to come out a keyboard and keystroke what I did was
then it's a small little opacity brush and as I press harder it becomes bigger and has more capacity
so it's really gonna depend on what you're trying to do but most of the time
I just did that by holding down the bottom button on it pen and you know
so and you might think well bigger is better right always like it gives you more precision
I know that having a tablet has really transformed the way that I process my photos
it just makes it so much more fun and intuitive to just use a pen instead of having the clunky
you can see they just straight up advertised it's good you know 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity
it just has this this kind of nice presentation about it so finally breaking the seal on this
you get a few registration cards right which is fairly typical for a product like this
yeah let's check out the actual build quality of this and the overall size so see
a very nice surface texture over with that very impressed with at least how it feels so folks
now there's really only a few ways you can use these things right one of them
I can say that this connection right here on the for the actual USB is very sturdy very strong
it is harder to kind of go back in terms of tech but yeah this is fine
I'm keeping a lot of my layers kind of separate so I can plan this out
the joy 11 was a decent hybrid laptop its entry level specs provide sufficient power for users
i'm warren for kl gadget tv and this is the review of the 2017 joy 11.
to hold the device for long durations and it could be a little compact without those bezels
i have been given a week to try out the joy 11 with the metal keyboard
dock the good news is the dock takes power from the tablet and it can even power up
transfer speeds and also not all apps in windows can run on a secondary storage device
the 2017 joy 11 is still a very convenient device to own despite of its shortcomings
so I get this email that's all - Chuck secure unboxing review invitation which I can immediately tell is legitimate
here's the USB that goes into the computer and here's the one that goes into the tablet
it's got this little knob you on it that you could put things in or maybe we're on a chain
I've had other tablets that I have to mess around for 45 minutes to find this
G network and of course it also has a up to 128 gigabytes of external memory
I got around like five and a half hours of viewing you know like full-on videos gaming
it was able to give me almost like 13 hours of just browsing the web total and lastly
I didn't do any reading on those but I assume it would give you a ridiculous amount of battery life
it's weighted very well and on top of that supports things like GPS and it has very loud speakers
and you don't want a lot of it when it comes to drawing digitally to illustrate further
this doesn't mean it feels cheap though the tablet itself is solidly put together and I like the simplicity
some review said that this angle did above them so it really depends on the person in their drawing posture
I personally have no problems with this because I do most of my work on my desk
if you can get all the other wires hidden and make your setup look really clean besides the stand
I actually switched from my main 15-inch pen display to this 13 inch as the main driver for my animation
that's how nice drawing on this device really is now while the pen display is nice
I haven't noticed any lad or anything when I'm playing with the apps on this tablet which is nice
play ten hours of reading so um depending on what you plan to do with it
keep in mind if you do plan to buy this tablet follow the rules of its in the instruction booklet
the battery only lasted about half an hour and I thought that there was something heavily
we're on with it and I was upset um but by for some reason the third full States hour charge
I don't know if that was just some weird glitch in the one I was using
but and then there's a whole little story that goes with it and it's just absolutely adorable so
I think that if oh it is designed for children 3 to 8 which I should have mentioned earlier
thank you so much for watching and please subscribe to the Dryden water YouTube channel thank you
i just wanted to see how the tablet would look in that little bag for a moment
okay so this is going to mainly be unscripted because i want my true feelings to be expressed
something i do have to say about it is when it came to the buttons on the side
i tried to configure them right but they didn't really seem to do what they were supposed to be doing
that didn't even come with any fancy buttons so to think that i could have had something like this
which is 75 bucks a lot less than what i originally paid for my first tablet
well it runs fast and it's at a good price but that's really all i have to say about it
i'll be leaving a link to their store in the description just in case you're interested in their products
this is where you would place the cartridges that you can put your safety guard or judge
did his downloads and he he's only three but he knows this inside and out already
he knows what to do but me to show you the camera because the camera is so much fun and
take a look at your pictures and you can make your picture your home screen there they are
that's why this whole bunch of these pictures because he just thought the pirate hat was pretty darn cute
um move down some breeders for him because he just loves that but right now we have it
it's fantastic at the case of occupied its educational and it's just more than I ever imagined
the screen itself should be protected as the case sits proud at the front for this
case is your typical 7 inch tablet which includes both front and rear cameras a single speaker
a headphone port micro usb port for charging and a micro sd slot if you wanted to upgrade the storage
the screen resolution is alright at 10 24 by 600 with 159 dpi and the screen is responsive enough
for what you need it for it's got an android back end with some pebble disney overlay which is nice
you're given the option to set up the parental controls under a parent profile which is passcode protected
but in fact you've got things like subway surfers rayman pac-man and of course that disney content too
pac-man racing being one of them which ran perfectly fine and i really enjoyed playing it
pebble tablet it's not at the forefront of tablet technology but 79.99 here in the uk it's affordable and
i don't need to worry about ads and random purchases within games and i like the parental controls
it would be good but i do like the idea that this is purely a games
otherwise it's pretty much the same so one of the biggest features you might have noticed about
and it's not going to change other than me you know flipping it back and forth
I mean it's it's a really low resolution you could probably get away with using Skype on it
I really do like compared to the speaker ports that they usually put underneath and those are useless
SIM card one of the things I had to get used to was that it has no scroll bars yeah
speed loading programs are pretty quick if I'm gonna load up word or something like that
the backslash the backslash was a little bit hard to find because I'm used to using those screen
don't even keep it that bright but you are able to use it outdoors if you need to
and other than the fact that the screen could flip backwards and turned into a tablet
this thing is great because like to bring around if you really need to type like what
that's what your desktop and maybe a gaming laptop is for is the price for this guy reasonable
I've ever used and there's absolutely no doubt that I would pay for the pro tax
I really expected this now on a Wacom you can get that on an iPad Android tablet
you're gonna find that but right now only the hooey on 13 has a display like that
that's pretty standard for displays in this kind of price range in you get used to it
changes my brush size just a little or just Scrolls a little it just zooms a little
I would expect to make my brushes smaller but in this case it makes my brushes bigger
usually it's the other way around so it took some time to reverse that in my brain
then you're gonna get the pen you're also gonna get a pen holder that can do its own fancy things
it's not uncommon for me to turn on a little bit of a stroke straightener when
I did pick up a tiny bit away but it's really one of the best pens
I look for because I do a lot of ink line work so I want a crisp clean line
I want it to be nice smooth at any angle and this pen pulls that off
and where the cursor appears on your screen below it also the slider on the side like
place it on the screen that just get kind of warm after using it for a while
this one has one along the bottom where your hand rest but the good news here is
this is a community based thing we try to do all things community art arcade you know
it's your local walmart with walmart the other day and for all them gamers out there
now check it out but here we go on this canvas your run 20 inch pro you did
okay you did okay man this thing by the way ladies and gentlemen was retailing for a thousand dollars
oh this is the glove that they used to draw because they keep your hands from touching the screen
this is really just a big ass money but uh you draw one big tablet man
all right so it goes in there and it'll stand from what i'm from what i heard
it's a digital pin so it don't look like your average pin you don't want to damage the pin
you can also use this as a tv to look at movies you can hook it up to your computer
i doubt you would spend that much money just to use it for that but you could
if you know what i'm talking about all right most laptops run out of like the same power
i figured this is to hook up to your tv or whatever you can hook this thing up to like
oh my god if this is not for this you guys that's got one of these already
oh this is the chord you use to hook this to your computer and actually use it
this thing draws this thing man i've seen people draw and i'm an artist good artists
hey you're wrong okay and let me let you guys know in in our next video
so we're gonna go out there and be filming you know taking a look at the tactical laser cat tag
hi everyone this is dave and in today's video i've got a very large google android tablet to show you
let's run off some of the other specifications very quickly 2 gigabytes of RAM inside 16 gigabytes of storage
and we start by just turning this around so you can see the screen thirteen point three inches
wow that is a really good display because sometimes when you get these larger Google Android tablets
maybe it's an import from another country and the screen is not that great on this
I mean switching between screens opening the app tray browsing the internet and running some of the applications
really nice and smooth and comfortable to hold and then this side here is quite angular
and that's because we've got a full array of ports so across this side we have got a reset switch
it's talked a little bit about the actual construction so around the outside on the back you can see
HD resolution we have got quite large bezels but again I think that was a good design choice
maybe this top bezel and the bottom bezel could have been a tiny tiny bit smaller but
Today I have a special double feature from the developers of Vankyo from their MatrixPad line of tablets.
So here I have both tablets lined up equally alongside each other, and what you will notice
Both models come with a 10.1 inch ISP display, and has a 1280 x 800 resolution.
To the right side of both models you have a power buttons, volume controls, built-in microphones, and headphone jacks.
To the top of both models you have Type C charging ports, however on the S20
So I’m back and here I have both tablets the S20 is on the left and S21 on the right.
The operating system of both models is Android 9 pie, and both models are not rooted.
The operating temperature of both models are low around 31°C. Both devices have the same number of sensors.
So in this comparison the only difference is that the S20 comes with 3GB of RAM and S21 has 2GB.
The S20 has an Antutu score of 97,451, and the S21 got a score of 96,225.
The response time of both models are the same, they are very responsive and I’m not experiencing any lag whatsoever.
Both models come with the mobile version of YouTube and they can only play up to 720p resolution.
Gameplay is smooth on both models, and my gamepad connected via Bluetooth and worked without issues.
The video quality is the same as expected seeing that they both carry the same hardware.
this is a little weird for me but i thought i'd try to do a voiceover for this video
but i had to send my tablet in for a pair and i ended up losing the recording files
i also didn't have my tablet on hand to work on it because it was getting repaired
yeah that kind of delayed it also if you notice a change in my workspace compared to the last video
but that definitely makes it portable if you're someone who likes to draw on the go
i think the glove that i currently use with my wacom tablet is actually my old galman glove
um i'm an idiot and forgot to do this so i'll just be using my own stand
if you've never used a gallon tablet before but i recognize the system right away from my previous gallon
it is noticeably dimmer than my other screen so i definitely recommend having another monitor to color check
what the speaking of price government also wanted me to let you all know about a promotion
they're having on this tablet if you purchase the tablet on amazon anytime from september 7th 2020 to the 13th
between the cursor and pen i found it pretty comfortable to adjust to and draw with
if that makes any sense i wanted to work on a bigger piece in this video
meaning that you don't have to recharge it or put any batteries in which is pretty cool looking more closely
and you can also customize the right-click on your pen and the pressure-sensitive and how you're comfortable with
I imagined it so I decided to sketch it again and I actually met my expectations
I guess you could say and I really like how it turned out so I went with it
it's also great practice to draw food because food is great so why not draw it too
I asked some of my friends if they had any opinions and none of them really helped me
it's completely comfortable because my last tablet was pretty big and it took a lot of space
I guess you could say and also that I love the fact that this pen is battery free
I did struggle a bit with the ten at first because this pen is very thin

I actually didn't think there would be that much of a size difference between the two given
but they go on sale for $99 all the time so keep your eye out on
the screen is brighter higher resolution and just looks overall much better than the on version

I did want to test the steam link app and it works great on this little tablet
AC Wi-Fi built in I haven't set up so when I press select on my controller
it's definitely a budget tablet but the price reflects that if you're interested in picking one of these up
and if you haven't checked out my 8 review link is in the description really appreciate you guys watching
in my opinion it's a great beginners tablet and it's also really good for advanced artists
thank you for treating humor and you get a warranty card in case it gets damaged and in my opinion
this tablet is great because you get a lot of space to draw on the drawing program
one is to connect the tablet and the other is to charge the stylus like the s 56k
I was using the s 56k and I've now deleted that and installed the new driver for this tablet
so that's actually pretty great that like with all these shortcuts that pretty much covers every key that
I've grown really accustomed to using the keyboard because it just feels natural that way but with all these shortcuts
is normal just kind of amar but this will just be a close-up of like my face
I've gotten too used to using the the monitor tablet so not looking directly at what
it's important to develop this kind of personality or this kind of character into your to your life you know
almost achieving full tired full done mode should add some under the shadow under the lips
I only got to play with it for that long and I haven't found any problems as of yet
not sure if there are any incompatibilities with different programs but I'm pretty sure it see it could be trouble
and they'll try to take care of any problems that you have definitely a good backup
if my tablet ends up you know not working someday this this will definitely save the day
it gives you more choices but there's also more choices that you have to make you know which
i5 has well low-power processor a high-resolution display four gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage
believe this so you can see that it supports touchscreen gestures you can run desktop apps
it's a little bit weird in laptop mode because it means that the power button is down here now
HP has a laptop that does that a couple of other companies have sort of does 360 degree rotating devices
there's a very large touchpad supports multi-touch gestures edge swiping and so forth have no problems with the touchpad
here now here's another one though where since it's not really optimized for high pixel count displays
I find that is actually a little tricky to use on this because of the high resolution display
desktop style applications that haven't been updated to take advantage of those high pixel per inch displays
but it's not one of these big clunky power bricks and my my only real reservation about recommending
that's a lot of money for a device that happens to be a tablet with a weird keyboard
it's easier to justify if it were a full-fledged ultrabook that was meant to be used as an ultrabook
it's nice to be able to do the touchscreen applications but it's a little bit weird to interact with
whether you pick it up with one hand or hold it with two to watch a video
the display is pretty good good viewing angles decent color accuracy and bright enough for indoor use
ok it's not brilliant outdoors but the majority of people will be using this inside useful battery
on zoom or teams premium tablets will offer thinner bezels lighter weight and a better quality
we're gonna talk about a budget tablet from the makers of Dragon touch the dragon touch m7
it is not the best part but we'll see what it can do seven inches resolution 1024 by 600
but yeah it wouldn't wouldn't work with the flash so there's some grapes on the 3dmark
I had to watch last download share just to show you guys how fast it works
I can't show you guys the video but I'll copyright protection and sorry about the video quality
I'm like I don't know about this benchmark test so I downloaded ashfall and surprisingly enough
it does take a long time to load up but once it's loaded up it runs great
you might see a little bit of glitching in the menus but once you hit start the race perfect see
the older hardware and sometimes the sound can be a problem but at all honesty 60 bucks
quick and snappy but this is a cheaper model and it does a lot for the price so well
I helped you out yeah if I did please like and subscribe and as always have a tech day you
kind of where that they have the two names there but basically it's the series three of the galaxy tab
there's a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera on the back and then a front megapixel front-facing camera of 1.3
it would take me two to three times to get it to register a touch in doing that other times
and that's something that you're looking for a little bit extra on the software side then
now let's take a look at the pros of the samsung galaxy tab 3 8.0 first
and it's definitely a lot less than this tablet is so price is definitely an issue here
hi we've teamed up with curio and Internet matters to talk to you today about the kurios smart
Android computer you have got a little computer that you can take about with you as a parent
on their tablet time controls bakiyev you can access millions of apps on the Google Play Store another feature is
I can change my avatar and my wallpaper like this one to cat you got YouTube kids
you can set these restrictions so that gives you peace of mind and they get to have fun so
hey what's up guys tim here and i'm just here to review the hp elite x2 generation 4 tablet so
but the main reason why i chose this particular tablet was because of the thin thin bezels
which are available on a certain certain tablet uh size which is the 13 inch one
it feels like a really high quality laptop keyboard and as i said before this is a a touch pad
it's a glass touch pad um and it actually feels um it actually feels really good
excuse me uh especially considering it has a uh 3 000 by 2 000 pixel pixel display
if you get the 1080p version but um i went for the for the 4k um for the 4k
have it down on the desk like this and then and then you can use it
um and this this tablet i can get about probably maxes out at about three hours usage
it's got a um got a fairly standard um standard front camera fairly standard rear camera as well
it just makes for really really quite a solid really quite a solid feeling tablet but anyway
perhaps the new version of this tablet if hp makes a new version um but thanks for watching
it costs only about 10 more than the previous model with the two gig of ram
this is where both of your speaker is located one right here and another right here
this is where your microphone is actually located now on the right hand side right here
now on top of the tablet right here is where your usbc charging port is located and right here
what i really like about this display is it has this pretty cool feature which is called icon first
the love uh the kids love it and after five years guys everything still works perfectly
i was surprised of how clear it is for this tablet at such an affordable price
but it's typical for most tablet at this price range good thing is it does have a built-in 3.5
oh yeah he's my team so the red person is the one that's uh not on your team
oh whoa whoa okay shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot shoot him shoot him shoot him
oh wow even got advertisements during the game but what i was saying is i'm surprised
let me know your thoughts in the comment section below and i will see you all in the next video
an xp pen has a 15 years of history making great quality graphic tablet and popular across worldwide
and it has a wireless connectivity tilt function and eight customizable shortcut buttons on the board other than that
it has the nice black plastic material at the back with tiny little holes texture and at the front
you need to remove it before you can use it but let's keep it first for now
so at the back of the tablet there are four anti-slip rubber at these four corners
if it doesn't show any light that means you need to charge it and the charge
test with horizontal strokes straight lines and diagonal lines and see if it has any latency or lag problems
let's test out the tilt function to see if it works like how it is advertised
when i tilt it down the brush icon will become longer and it detects the angle where i bent
when i press harder or lighter it does sync with the board nicely both on vertical orientation and finally
i'm able to draw something on android devices without problems that i previously have which the mappings are not correct
it has up to 8k of pressure sensitivity levels and with the quick response rate up to 220.
and lastly the best feature of all wireless so is it a worthy product to purchase
I think that the screen it's I don't know the glass or the plastic on this one
it has sort of a feeling of plastic rather than than glass and and it's really fingerprint magnet
if you're not trying to it edit videos on this one you will be fine with the normal YouTube
because it will overcharge even if you put a microSD on it and try to expand the memory
yes you can do but to be honest the CPU and the GPU on this one
I mean you can do it but you will start to see the slowdown of the device
what I do advise is that if you want to person videos photos you know movies on an SD card
but then again you can also put too much so I think you capped at 42 gigs
Buy if you need a tablet just for your kids or your small children and just for them to you
know play around with with the educational apps and watch a bit of youtube kids and stuff like that so
it's it's it's really not great but nevertheless you get a speaker for less than 50 pounds so can't complain
I think that if you're looking for a tablet for your kids you know that you don't mind breaking scratching
this one is really good although I don't recommend to use a micro SD card to install app
it runs on jelly bean 4.2.2 as per this milagro company says the specification looks quite good
let's took the real actual product how it works and how so we are unboxing here
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack micro usb and the dc power plug and those buttons are volume rockers
look here nothing's customized on the setting we have about tablet and it runs on 4.2.2 android version
the battery 3662 millivolt internal storage as per the box specification external storage we have we have 13.6 gb available
the tabs are we cannot distinguish these those tab actually this this one cost only 5 000 rupees on flipkart
we get we get okay sound but only with one speaker not two no dual speakers
i already setup this game at lower resolutions and medium drawing distance the game is still loading the game okay
some days screen is responsive but color quality and the actual colors are pretty much poorer
i'm just neither recording or not capturing the photos but see it's still lagging so much
and be able to add that in there at the top we have left 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
not an octa-core so we have four cores running at 1.8 gigahertz and two cores running at 1.4
I want to be able to basically split here so I'll hold here move it up
well we went ahead and switched over to the eight megapixel sensor on the back of the device again
this is a quick sample using the back sensor just to see how it would look like
you can lock it by either having a swipe pattern pin or password there is no fingerprint sensor option
Google application backup and reset system update as I mentioned to you guys this is updated to Android 7.0
you can go in there and customize the notification stays set up whichever ones you'd like the
LTE connection I'm gonna say thank you very much to Verizon for allowing me to check this out
Brad Linder with lilliputian and this is a Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet it's an 8 inch
we've got the Chrome web browser here the OneNote application and Microsoft Office as well so
I've got all of the everything sort of scaled to 125 percent so the text isn't too small to read
there's a little door that covers an SD card slot and we've got a micro USB port
what really makes it special though is you can then prop this up at a variety of different angles and
there we go so you can see we can prop it up here we can prop it up here
$40 seems like a bit much for a case for a tablet that sells for $300
that's using desktop mode and surfing the web and composing documents and using Microsoft Office and so forth
if you're doing lighter tasks like saved a little bit of web surfing using this that's metro or full-screen mode
you can find more details at Lilla feuding comm this is Brad Linder with little buting
well here's a cat for scale that's 18 inches by 10.5 inches of screen area for you to draw on
it reduces the glare and has a less slick feeling making it more like paper than glass
the stand itself is sturdy and easy to slide up and down and also since this tablet is huge
it didn't angle correctly it was too slick of a screen and i just didn't like it
but the pd 2200 changed that the matte finish feels more natural than any other screen tablet
i've used before and i can angle it to a position that's more fitting for me
there are pros and cons to any tablet but i think i finally found a screen tablet
the active area is 10 by 6 inches which is a good size to use for any monitor size
we have four rubber feet behind to prevent that tablet from slipping on the table and corners are rounded off
you can configure specific keyboard shortcuts to this buttons or use any of their predefined functions
this is the pen included that supports up to slightly over 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity
but you're not using a finger you're still using your pen tools to push the mouse around
you can basically enter anything you want the predefined functions available are this fall in accurate mode
if you use this method to smooth the lines you may see some input lag by that
let's try some thin and thick transition so it seems to work fine and lines they are mostly quite smooth
you can open the brush options and click the size option here and you can see that this pressure option
I can get in a thick lines really easily and strokes they taper really well here pressure
I'm not going to repeat the drawing test here with Adobe Illustrator pressure sensitivity works by default
we're gonna explain you about the drawing tablet s 610 so we have a lot of options
let's see oh we have a pen and a stamp and we have in the sand pan
ok so we've got like a QuickStart guide which explains to us where everything is located
then we've got a tray for a memory card and it also says SIM cards now
nothing on the bottom because the speaker is on the back as I showed before so yeah
I'll play some videos later on the place of games just to show you how it looks
the video recording capabilities for example are 720p at the front and on the back and the picture
so it's not brilliant but it's there if you need to make an odd Skype messenger video call then
Android or better and then that and so yeah I would say it's a pretty decent device
and the inside is lined with this like black sponge type material so it keeps his table safe
next thing out of the box is the drawstring bag which is kept inside some plastic actually feeling the bag
i've used drawing templates for years straight before and i've only had to replace the pen
just remember to replace your pet nibs when it looks like they're getting low otherwise you'll risk getting your pen
when i draw on a tablet they help me maneuver around the screen so much easier
finally we're on to drawing with the tablet so drawing on this tablet feels so nice
i thought i'd mention it though in case um but i it did not bother me
i personally don't have an issue with it but i know some people might not like it
it just comes up to preference with person to person for those of you who watched my last video
i hope to do more of these types of videos in the future so have fun drawing bye you
giving me both a sample bag and just one of their gift bags that they sell
so this stuff will last you long can you think but I just think the packaging is absolutely beautiful
so let's get into it now if you are unfamiliar with tablet which you probably are
you're outside of the UK it's the closest thing I've been compared to is like fudge
except where fudge is kind of soft and creamy and sometimes chewy tablet is kind of crumbly
it's cooked longer so it's got a kind of deeper richer flavor and a totally different texture
it's just kind of a thing that you have to look if you live here so as you can see
I'm gonna give you another close up just to show you how beautiful the texture of this tablet is
it's buttery obviously because it's tablet and it's basically a block of like condensed milk butter and sugar
it makes me so proud to live in this country when it sees things like that honestly and again
this is like that perfect balance between soft and melt in the mouth and that kind of granular crumbly texture
don't forget to hit that thumbs up button and subscribe so that you don't miss anything
um pretty much all these languages i need to make sure i should accidentally click it
so it has all these different languages or different places that speaks english or speak english
uh let's see bring your data from a backup from an android phone and backup from
it's asked me to punch in a pen so i'm just going to confirm unlock with your face
no thank you and this is obviously the wallpaper that is chosen and so we just go through the settings
i think it was at 80 originally so it starts at 80 keep at 83 for now see eye comfort
you have your color and contrast here's wallpaper so you can change the worn to cool
you have your sound and so i turned off the alarm the notification and the media volume
okay so now we're just going to look at video and see the resolution how it place
so i just want to say that so total i would say five out of five
so we'll see uh how the video looks and how the picture looks like it went through a little blur
okay so now we're gonna do a review of the tablet and so one thing i really liked
um there's a little bit of i guess rumble but that's pretty much in every tablet
well no issues has android 10 and i downloaded and showed the video of the game
it's okay but uh tablets are not known for uh great video and then also picture is okay and again
if you're looking for a tablet and if you like this video please like and subscribe my social media
today i'll use the cable because i prefer this old wireless connection but you can use whatever you want so
it's petrol free and i think it's a big plus for those who wonder how to install driveway
well the tablet goes 8 182 pressure levels and it feels good in comparison with my old tablet
i selected eraser and the second key which means b and thus a selected a brush
one thing when you touch the surface with the pen a light will light up near the logo type
i want to say that the tablet isn't that expensive but it doesn't make it bad
you have a pretty face and i've been smoking on so many days around a pretty place
just drink it down but if the city never sleeps you have a pretty face you
we'll find a micro SD card slot so we can expand the storage plus a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
so we can use headphones with this without any kind of weird adapters not much going on around back here
I think the on tablet looks a bit better than the Amazon fire HD 8 screen
Vudu and the Walmart ebooks app this thing also has 802 11 BG in an AC Wi-Fi
megapixel front facing camera and a 2 megapixel rear facing camera so with all the specs out of the way
I ran some benchmarks tested some native Android gaming some emulation and some video playback alright so here it is
Hulu and even if you want to use Kodi you could install a build from there
we got that two gigabytes of RAM that MediaTek 8163 quad-core at one point three gigahertz that mal
these are very low on the charts and in my opinion both of these are low-end
Android gaming this is a touchscreen gaming here but you can connect a wireless Xbox one ass controller
Store went to top charts and trending and found this pinata game and this tablets handling it
I'm gonna be testing from the Google Play Store in this video is san andreas surprisingly
PSP or Dreamcast very well it's a low-end device and it's really just not going to handle it
Advance is even going to work well on here but like I said Dreamcast PSP GameCube
Android and the fire eight HD runs a modified version of Android called fire OS which personally
I don't like it at all so if I had to choose I would go with this tablet here
it's review time the HS 611 was provided for free by the good folks over at huion
Pro 16 pen as you can see here except for the color bill for some reason
so this pain won't work on the campus pro and the canvas pro pen won't work on this
there's no cursor so you can't see where drawing I don't know if it's the art programs
the driver suite looks like is pretty much identical to the canvas pro six teams one
you're just drawing directly to the graphics tablet and you're just gonna be looking at your screen now
you know you draw straight to the screen and mimics traditional media pretty much but with a graphics tablet
we're still a it feels still feels a little bit more difficult but it's still fine
it's fine well the Express keys on the side and ice is responsive as you expect
they're nice and clicky - they got a good tactile feel to them but again they're with the touch bar
I prefer like a tactile thing like the rotary dial found on the xB pen artist 15-6 Pro
that thing was really nice about touch if it just gets in the way as you might see
it's too lightweight to hold the pen properly and it feels really cheap but overall score wise
the main selling feature of this is of course the ability to have it work on
Express keys eight multimedia keys that unfortunately you can't reprogram and you've got that Walt could touch bar
who don't want to jump into the screen tablet game just yet or can't afford to and yeah
and that's only if you don't want any extra accessories such as the usbc cable or the display stand
right away feels sturdy so light i definitely can see myself taking it um to go somewhere
it is very small and light but we will look at it in more detail later on
seems comfortable and seems very light to hold very light so definitely be interesting to be working with this
you know how much i love these so i'm just gonna put it on right away
let's actually see what it would look like with the pan on top as you can see
i'm just going to download the driver and i'll get back to you in a sec
so i took a couple of hours to work on this sketch and just feel out the tablet
so all you have to do is power it off and then unplug and plug back again
it was like really fun to work with this tablet and i'm very pleasantly surprised with the overall experience
i am used to this big tablet and the 24 inches so going back to 13
Remove the plastic wrap and you will see a tab to remove the screen’s packaging cover.
Hold it, name side facing up and push down with your thumbs hard to open it.
It’s a budget plastic stand, so you only get the one drawing angle out of it.
By the way, I do not recommend drawing on tablets from one brand with pens from a different brand.
The side of the tablet has the power button and a quick switch for brightness adjustment.
Overall with this tablet I see that XP-Pen continues to have a better build quality compared to Huion and Gaomon.
If you don’t need the extension cord, you can plug the red end right into the power block.
When you plug the tablet in, if you had a dual display setup before, some windows might go missing.
To be able to switch between scroll wheel modes, set one of the shortcut buttons to KL/KR Mode Switch.
The product page says it’s also compatible with Clip Studio, Corel Painter, Maya, Mudbox, and ZBrush.
there was between the pen and the screen due to the special coating on the screen.
I am not a heavy-handed artist, so again, this was a surprise and a bit frustrating right off the bat.
So I’d have to go back and tap again to get the button or whatever it was to go.
You just have to press harder than you’d expect if you’re used to a different tablet.
The default setting for one of the pen buttons is to switch between pen and eraser.
In summary, if your pen is acting strange in an art program where the eraser/brush pen button doesn’t work
If you keep your computer on and turn the tablet off, the tablet monitor is still technically live.
You can turn the tablet on and drag things back, or just right click >> Display Settings >>
Just remember to fix your display settings afterward or when your tablet is on you’ll get nothing.
the cable feels pretty firm and hefty and designed so that one end with the HDMI and USB plugs
slate design of the tablet has certainly come first before the ergonomics of the quick access buttons
wrap your hand around it to get your thumb on that wheel as for the buttons along the top
the brightness and colors didn't need bumping up just a bit as for the hard plastic flat folding stand
going from a more shallower design option on the desk or using the bar for something a bit steeper
little 16 gigabyte branded memory stick in a minimalist metal case with a tiny ball chain
it's a very basic thing to add but also a very nice touch to find it included with your tablet
go at plugging those tablet cables directly into the back of my Nintendo switch docking station
Bosto tablet website to their latest drivers for the 16 HD which was all absolutely fine but when installing it
32 dot dll file wasn't quite kicking in properly and my computer was not registering for pressure sensitivity
you do find yourself digging in quite hard in order to hit for highest pressure levels now
you've got the touch screen for hotkeys crammed in the memory card and all of that
Kevin here coming at you with my review of the tech last t30 Android tablet so
I'm not really sure how useful it really is to have a SIM card in your tablet
so if you're gonna be watching movies you can watch them in the native 1080p resolution
the overall design is on the front now internally we're getting 64 gigabytes of storage and we also get micro
if you want security on your tablet or you can just go without a password or anything like that
you can easily scroll through your feed you can also swipe over of course and begin
but it's not like you're really going to be using them to take any sort of sophisticated good looking photos
I mean definitely an iPad does feel a lot more solid but this is a less expensive option
have these pins here so you can easily connect to the keyboard then on the other side
Helio p 70 processor you're gonna have decent performance when browsing the web going on webpages and stuff
of course it's not going to be necessarily the smoothest operation ever but this is also not an iPad pro
we're getting a cellular connectivity for the price that's being offered at that's personally not a feature that
that smart phone would be costing about this price as well but I hope you enjoyed this video
let's talk about the tablet itself and i must admit i really like how it looks like
it's pretty cool and have these blue and purple marks all over it and i just love blue and purple
i decided to compare this tablet to how i usually draw my tablet and whoa i can make thinner lines
one of the benefits of connecting a tablet to a tablet is that you get better pressure sensitivity
i hope it's nothing dangerous but if it is it's not my problem because the computer ain't mine okay
i'll try to actually draw something and tell you my experience but to make things simpler
i don't know how to explain but like i'm used to drawing right on the screen
i'm Jazza and this video is a review of the in spray h9 50p from huion now
Agera the way at the star the next is that this video is sponsored by Huey on
so if you want to have the tilt feature but also would prefer to buy off of
I try and be as unbiased and informative as possible sharing the pros and cons in my overall experience
H hey th cut that you guys are gonna call me out on that so much
it's doing that in so that's it for all of the basic specs and on the surface level
that sounds like a good but fairly standard sort of device the actual use of it
I open up Photoshop and immediately started drawing and this is where I started to be a little bit surprised
I say that because like I said I have used a lot of pad tablets in my lifetime
this is the first time that I found myself immediately enjoying the experience because I'm gonna be honest
this is sort of got one of those weird things where you're in one of either sweet spots
this device boasts tilt functionality which is fairly new for you know a small form-factor and really cheap tablet
it makes the art programs that support tilt feel like new and completely deeper art programs
I use every day and it felt way better and I don't know what it is like
it felt way more impressive the difference that made to use a lot of the default
I travel a lot so I take my laptop with me and usually on flights or in hotel rooms
it's fairly small but it's also quite heavy and you don't just bring the mobile studio pro
or you're actually someone who needs a little extra utility in their professional day-to-day lives such as myself
that's it for now ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for watching and until next time
you can play a bunch of games you can type some emails chat with your friends
you have a flap which houses the micro SD card slot and the SIM card slot
the textured back adds to the grip which is a nice touch coming to the display the
you can use the speakers if you absolutely need to but you are better off using a pair of headphones
and if you have used an Android device in the past you will feel right at home
which will be a problem if you play games like subway surfer that require you to swipe a lot
don't expect this to last you an entire day on the PC Mag battery benchmark test
now it's hard to recommend a tablet for 12000 rupees especially when it has just average performance
if you're looking at productivity on the tablet side well look no further than the ThinkPad x1 tablet from lenovo
Milo, look! Wacom just sent me their newest Wacom Cintiq 16, and I've heard great things about this.
I thought today we could unbox it, see all the features, and then I can draw you guys something.
Well, it looks like I can give one away at the very end of the video.
And I have done a review for them before, on their Mobile Studio Pro, which retails for about...
Screwing screws. I didn't know this before, but the Cintiq also has its own stand, built inside the Cintiq.
But if you want something higher and a more adjustable height, then you would probably get the stand.
And before we actually get started, I always like to test new tablet displays with the detail technique.
I look at old artwork. I look at the colors, and the brightness, and the vibrance.
And this is an original character from Nima's world. Her name is Sloan. This is why you read instruction manuals.
The upside is, the stand is a nice quality and makes for the best drawing experience.
And if you're thinking about getting a Cintiq 16, Wacom is giving all my fans a free stand!
This code is valid for two weeks starting today, and I'm really sorry, US members only.
Nestle my little brother just kind of dumped it somewhere and it cut all the floor sir
I really didn't see a table with this kind of button so I'm just thinking we can figure this out
Oh Oh Derek going to soon okay so we got a pen name that has four appendix
it's part when it's all cut off but my little brother lost in the progress so please
I noticed that this tablet is pretty light compared to my 4 years old Bamboo tablet
I haven't been using a tablet in four years and this is like the most beautiful thing ever see
I hope I didn't get this wrong or outside to shoot this again and I don't really hit the time
okay not sure if you can actually see that up close or you have bright enough okay
the whole thing is in matte black and it has a little tiny bit of like it's not exactly smooth
I know it's plastic but it's not like this kind of cheap plastic that it's glossy and stuff like that
this one feels more a little bit serious or okay like that and it one of those
it looked like those hewn ones where you need to plug it in and charge and this one
we have a line in the center and then the top is completely smooth so even not looking
you can still feel that this is the bottom this is the top row and then this is the top
this is the bottom because the bottom like you can think the closer it is to the center
one good thing is if you also have the small tablet right here this is the MEAC forgot a whatever
you can also use your other pen with this one as well they can interchange so basically
I hate USB cable and it got a 90 degree head right here which is very convenient
because this kind of tablet you always want that 90 degree thing and not just sticks out
there are some models that still don't have the 90 degree thing and so annoying at this one
so yeah it's the same driver you don't need to uninstall anything if you have the small tablet
I have three tablets in one machine and everything is done now using this touchpad first okay
okay red something like this hey so I have my top button and the bottom button set up
okay so the sensitivity is very good and doesn't really require any tweaking and all alike to me
it's very friendly for desk that it's not so big because it doesn't go so wide okay
this one's like why but it's not deep so it's great for this kind of setup where
check out the link below to get yours and if you want to ask me like
i thought it would be a great opportunity to open myself up to other types of tablets that way
and lastly of course your drawing pen which is really lightweight and doesn't require charging which is awesome setting up
that has a non-slip backing so i use that which you'll see a bit later on
i heard from other people that calibrating for this tablet is better out of the box
it came with a preset to change between the eraser and the pen and also a color picker
having a smaller screen felt a bit weird to me but i don't blame the tablet for this at all
this is a great upgrade or a starting point drawing on it felt pretty natural though
but there's an even better deal going on from the 7th until the 13th of september
removing and replacing nibs was kind of cool the little stand that they have for the pen
i appreciate you all stopping by and i hope that we can draw together again soon
I also have an art piece prepared to paint with. And maybe I'll give one away at the end!
right out of the box, it feels pretty handy, you know, it feels like the correct size.
So this stand has a very hexagonal feel, you know, all these kind of a triangular accents and angles.
Bear with me Power, to block, to USB, to another USB, to the red... to this!
As you get more familiar with setting it up, it becomes a lot more familiar and easy
and kind of add the sharp features, add the details, and see how the tablet responds
I'm adding a summer hat, you know, maybe she's at the beach and with her pet dragon.
I like to go in there, you know, add some details and see how it responds.
But what is a Ross Draws video without some color dodge!? So let's do some color dodge!
Probably one of the most affordable tablets on the market that can project a second monitor on.
Make sure, you know, you don't try to show off because people are gonna steal it.
On the plus side, those wires does give you a lot of options depending on what your setup might be.
I'm giving away one here on YouTube and Milo will give the other one on Instagram!
it took a long time to get to me but I think their prices are quite competitive compared to others
I did have to download the latest test driver for it to work on my machine
if you had a light right above you it would be very difficult to work with
which is not a big problem and the shiny screen some people find awkward to draw on
it's got a bit of roughness to it but it's not a great deal of difference
the big problem you're gonna find is the parallax so that's like the screen thickness in a way
I'm in Krita here and it seems absolutely fine and the pen sensitivity seems really nice
you can see me here during faint lines and then heavy lines and they come out really nice this
the main difference of notice between this and the huion is that the drivers worked for me whereas the huion
so there's my review for the ug 2150 very impressed would I buy it yes I would
if you've got any experience of these things thanks again to gearbest really appreciate it and thanks for watching
which is around six inch so as to make the gap between the smartphone and tablet closer
it is also very thin because the thickness is only six point one millimeter for this screen
the result of the picture are still pretty good and sharp enough for the tablet class
reason are still quite reliable if only available social media or for video calls for performance this
the point is still very responsive and pretty fast doing any activity using the Xperia z4 tablet feels even better
so if you want to gaming it's still quite reliable but for heavy gaming it seems less ok
I try playing party and the default setting are in low graphic and medium frame rates
it's the game can run quite stable yes out of it is not smooth enough okay
SOC that was used namely Snapdragon 810 yes never like an egg then use it to be famous for
it's easy to hit an overhead chip set but in fact never can attend in the experience devoted
it is still quite durable considering the large screen with 2k resolution for my usage experience
this tablet can last a day with a screen on time run for until 5 hours from the charging time
depends on the charger output that we use ok according to us the Xperia z4 tablet is still quite recommended
i have tested the tablet with various drone software on windows and mac os and the drawing performance
two customizable side buttons the pen supports tilt sensitivity as well as slightly over 8 000 levels of pressure sensitivity
and in this pouch there are some replacement nibs there are eight including the nip remover
there is this additional windows ink function which you may have to toggle on or off to troubleshoot
so you do have to read the instruction manual on the quick start guide or on the website
and here you can customize the 10 physical shortcut buttons they have already been pre-assigned to some shortcuts like razer
it's very easy to draw dots as well and they react to pressure changing brush sizes using this touch
it's really easy so you can change brush size very quickly and very smoothly so the overall drawing performance
while i was testing the app yesterday there was some issues with zooming in and out using the shortcut buttons
so you can see it's very easy to draw lines with varying thickness and this pen
it has a nice tactile feeling when you are drawing and the lines they just come out exactly the way
so i can have the cursor point upwards or be vertical like this or i can have the cursor
this tablet can work with android devices as well such as android phones and tablets running android 6 or newer
so let me just connect this to my smash that hub android phone here on the left
the only other difference between the available sizes is that the small one has six customizable application-specific
I not sure whether that's the right term for it but that's just how I call it
it really feels sturdy even though it is only eight millimeters thick the multi-touch gestures work
Welcome back. This is the Intuos 4 graphics tablet It comes in three different sizes and in this review
Now it has an active area in this central position here of 223 by 140 millimetres and
that's inside giving it a total of 14 hours bachelor and all together which is very impressive
which is great if you using it whilst traveling and can be a bit clumsy like me
I think it's really useful to have considering the price which I'll talk about later with the power keyboard
Start menu or if you're in tablet mode to go back to the home screen there
so there's no junk wear or adware or anything else loaded on here beyond just the normal windows experience
you'll probably want to update everything before you install software on it on the side here
this is for charging but it's also compatible with the OTG format and they include an adapter in the box
give or take if you start loading up a lot of games or doing some more intensive kind of activity
you'll see far less than that but for doing tablet kinds of things like email and web browsing
you've got a lousy camera on the front and a really lousy camera here on the back
the camera on here is not as strong a selling point but it does do well in other areas
so let's take a look now and see how it performs so let's kick things off with some YouTube watching
so you can get a feel for any drop frames we might be experiencing but so far
no dropped frames on the playback here and this is performance consistent with other devices running with the same chipset
I think it's again due to the fault of the Wi-Fi the Wi-Fi here is a 2.4
so it's performing at least in its hardware side of things from the processors perspective about where
I think these performance issues are Wi-Fi related and because this tablet is running the full version of Windows
you can run the full version of Windows software so I've got an older version of Microsoft
I mentioned cost about $60 only $20 less than the entire computer will cost you here
we are running at 800 by 600 but it is running pretty decently with all the settings turned down
I was seeing frame rates anywhere from 30 to 40 frames per second so very very playable here
I did get to drop frames at the outset here but generally it has been performing as expected
we just playback here should do fine with the mpeg-4 compression that those discs typically have so all in
I think this is a pretty good little device an 8-inch tablet $80 running the full version of Windows
is that they give you a one-year warranty with it so you do have some protection there
work pretty well and I think those will perform with games and other things better than a cheaper card
hey everyone Mukul here and this time I'm here with another review of a pen tablet which is Huion 1161.
USB to USB C and USB micro converters inside the box and it's actually very interesting what they actually do.
there are two buttons on the pen and the top click by default works as right
570 grams feels light on this perfectly sized tablet the size also feels very portable -
I am not sure because I have never met the mountain personally and I hope I never do
Huion earlier used to give less at active area to work on so a super saiyan update right there
I never knew that these soft keys were there on this older tablet - haha so lame
how big of a boost and upgrade was coming from the h610 pro tablet which we used earlier
but the kind of premium they asked for those tablets may it be a display tablet
well you can connect the pen tablet directly to your Android phone or tablets but so far Android only.
yeah it's definitely a restriction that you are only able to use the pen tablet in portrait mode
but it's better than having no feature at all and I don't think huion is charging anything
it's up to you but I'm pretty sure a lot of people would definitely love this
the ease of scribbling on your Android phone or an Android tablet from anywhere is quite a good proposition
use it any way you want on your sofa on your bed in the swimming pool
I was able to see a pointer on the screen but on other non stylus phones
I mean it's not quite as nice as like an iPad or Samsung screen but for 79 bucks
you could change the home screen wallpaper but you can't anymore but you got some different stuff in here
you can obviously load in your own videos so use the video player with as well so
you can turn that off in the settings if you want and then you can use a different
so there just like a whole bunch of different things you can look that up on
I did a separate video for a long time ago you can look it up on YouTube
so there's ditional settings in here like you have to turn on text-to-speech up in here
this was driving me crazy at first because like this thing will automatically adjust the screen brightness and
if you want to increase the font size you can increase like the size of everything so like all
you got a few different things in here like you can turn off a leg sight
like if you do using different gestures so we've got the color inversion so there's some different accessibility options
let's start with a really quick unboxing and then i'll show you everything about this tablet
i've been testing it so far but it is what it is on the positive side
let me just remove this film and the one on the back too and there you have it guys
nevertheless it feels steady and strong the sides are made of plastic and you can see the buttons there
these buttons and here is the usb type-c charging port moving along at the bottom of the tablet
it doesn't feel cheap for example if you look at the accent the gold accent around the camera there
so basically you have the google apps and that's it no rubbish apps this is all you get
let's have a look at it really quick looking at the settings and on the display
i'm not sure if you guys can tell on camera the quality of the screen or not
i'm going to leave it for a while because i i'm going to use this tablet
hey guys i think it's pretty good as you guys can see not as good as my skills
it could have a bit more lows in my opinion but i think it does the job
i forgot to mention is built-in gps dual wi-fi band that five gigahertz band for me
let me know if you wanna try anything else in particular down below in the comments
and it's the same size as the 830 so 10 by 6 nice big drawing area
it's got a pen with a nice of case sort of material case and the pen is quite nice
it's a bit more whack on shape than the last one so it's possibly a touch more comfortable
I didn't notice too much but it's been a little while since I've used the a 30
you're getting the same across the board in my opinion but this one at 40 pounds doing very well
I find a little bit irritating and in different programs that will go faster or slower
you can see a bit of footage here of me drawing as an absolutely fine experience
no frills package here black box and this is where they cut the corners of course on their packaging costs
we've got the usb cable which is usb to type c our charger which is 5 volts 2.1 amps and
there is a guide right here and floating about is a sim tray tool so the build of this
one is a plastic frame around the outside with this alloy on the rear of it
most rear cameras on these tablets especially at this price range us are rubbish and this one is no exception
the octa core does actually have that support there which is great so up front here bezels
so there's no ugly gap between the touch digitizer and the glass it is optically bonded
i have encountered with my time using it so this screens touch is very good on the edges
i'm not having any zones or areas with missed touches or not actually working and looking at the gamma
but it's very hard to see this and i think it's not going to bother anyone really
i had the same problem with the launcher that they had with the audio cube neo x so performance
you cannot actually get it from the google play store at the time of this video
you need to get it just the apk file and then install it that way to get it
of course that is a bit of a weakness a little bit like the performance here so antutu
i noticed that when i was looking at google maps it was quite a bit off
i knew where i was on the street but it kind of put me in the middle
i've noticed that my signal reception and strength you'll see just at the top here 4g
i'm getting where i am based normally between about three and four bars of signal strength which is basically what
i've heard definitely not i would rate it as average but it's not actually too bad for the price
they have a hint of bass and they don't sound too bad considering the price of this tablet
good here so the 1200p resolution at 10.1 inches means that you cannot actually see at normal reading distances
it's not perfect nor would you expect it to be for what it is selling for
so a cheap tablet but it really does offer so much a fully laminated actually decent ips
so it's not a super powerful tablet so if you do game a lot i'll say it again
uh we're gonna open this up see what's inside and make some art with it so i'm excited
it's got a magnetic closure and a really nice texture and it's padded so it'll keep your tablet safe
so boop it's gone those marks that were there they're gone it's it's just this is it's like magic
and it comes with a little stand that opens up and extra nibs are stored inside
i have the stylus buttons here set to right click and alt so that i can easily color pick
i also changed the orientation of the tablet so that it works for left-handed users with the buttons
i think it would make a really good tablet for traveling with so with that in mind
it's about nine by five and a half inches and i'm used to working with the medium
wacom intuos pro which is about 13 by eight and a half inches but the canvas size was fine
it feels kind of like drawing on paper because it has a little bit of a tooth like a texture
i didn't have time to try this tablet out with my phone for this video but expect another one soon
make sure you're here for that by the way this piece is of my character nova
and it explores mental health and dissociating and that feeling of being kind of disconnected from everything
there's a link in the description to where you can download that or you can go to jcchase.gumroad.com
if you liked it please hit the like button or if you hated it that's fine
so it's gonna be a lot bit of a games in my week now with this
it's also a much more efficient chip in terms of better life as you see later on
but they've dropped the resolution inside the box you will find the tablet with a pre-applied screen
so if you buy one of these new and you don't have the screen protector on it
it's going to take approximately three hours and a half to fully charge the 8000 really an hour battery type
connector right here so there is an optional keyboard for this particular tablet but at the time of my review
D and in hand it does feel good if I give it a bit of a flex
320 and overall that is good and the white balance out of the box cannot be calibrated
on first years you're going to have 55 gigabytes approximately free and this is to point out
strength is actually good dear and that brings me on then to our wireless you see
this was taken on the other side of the studio and it actually did okay here so it really depends
after a couple of hours of gaming you get a little bit of build up around here
I've got it on the highest frame rate sitting that it'll let me select and overall you can see
your mobile phone will take a much better photo and record much better video than this tablet right here
no they are very cheap cameras on this tablet but do the job for Skype and basic video chat apps
that's a lot of things here that has going for it for the 200 price tag
the resolution isn't just the only thing the touch response in certain applications is quite poor for example
so if you're using your neighbor's wireless or your routers on the other side of your house
most exciting thing is obviously this has Intel eighth generation dual core quad core rather 15 watt CPUs inside 8th
no extra spend pricing starts around 12 79 or so it's available with a core i5 8250
finding applications that support it but the windows inc modern ink built-in applications will support it
they made a special little slot just to put this little piece of plastic in that
well that it comes with some obviously you stick this in a bag I would worry about
of course you know the competition their latitudes and the surface pro also feel pretty sturdy too
resting your hand on the glass without actually accidentally having Lyons vector it's a very good experience
and it has two-stage backlighting and has a track point the erase turistic pointer on board
the only drawback is compared to larger thing pads the key travel is shorter 1.3 millimeters or
report surface pro has a pretty good track pad too but this one is a mylar surface
trackpad it behaves perfectly well the cover just like the surface by the way has magnetic
there's only Thunderbolt three which is not it's like I said one of them is used for charging
SD card slot and a nano SIM card slot if you happen to get the optional
you can see the we've got 99% of srgb we've got all the metrics that were here
hey my tests with brightness set to 150 nits and productivity and streaming video sort tests a few
and that's something we usually don't see and the competitor is the surface pro particularly from business standpoint
sensitivity is the thing that's supposed to make drawing digitally more natural and helps with the line
and honestly it makes this screen look smaller but overall this tablet it's quite small and quite lightweight
unfortunately it is not quite resistant because I already scratched it with a pen twice very disappointing
I had to borrow my sister computer and it works really well here after I set up all the shortcuts
that drawing on a computer with a display tablet now feels so so weird and different
I do prefer to use an Apple pencil compared to a normal standard tablet pen for digital art
I own a 13 HD Cintiq and I got the same problems I got with this one
sometimes there shouldn't be such problems the fact that the driver is really bad and the screen
it's got a 1.6 gigahertz octa-core processor three gigs of ram 32 gigs of on-board storage
feels sturdy on the side here we have our volume rocker and our power button on the bottom here
so let's go ahead and turn it on okay so now that everything's been set up
like i said you can also use expandable storage if you need to put more storage in here
so let's go ahead and download some games and see what it can do in there
the brightness seems to be pretty good especially when you're inside again it's at 100 percent
one little annoyance that i did find out when i was trying to do some video
the rear camera is only capable of doing 720p and the front camera is only able to do 480.
you definitely want a better quality camera but it'll get you by in a pinch picture
the link is in the video description below the content in the text review and in this video
so on this end there are eight replacement nibs included and that in the middle there that's the nib remover
click or you can configure this to use it as an actual wheel where it can scroll clockwise or anticlockwise
I am using my OS 10.14 Mojave and this particular version of Mac OS requires additional setup
so here you can adjust the pressure sensitivity of the pen using the is a little dot here now
the transition from thin to thick it's really smooth by default and as the curve turns the corner
the pen is able to maintain consistent pressure which means when you look at a curve
like this it's supposed to be smooth the pressure that thickness should not change and this is the right
Crete ah on Windows where I wasn't able to get precious sensitivity working for some reason so pressure sensitivity here
this tablet can also work with your Android smart 4 and right version six or newer
you need to lift up your pen to use your fingers to navigate now with this particular app
USB device by default so click the check box and click OK and it will show that it successfully connected
it's also very responsive there is no lag at all so that's great since no driver
and this tablet it has a lot of features it has 8000 levels of pressure sensitivity to sensitivity
US dollars cheaper at u.s. $89 and of course if you want to work with your Android phone
the surface of the screen is smooth and matte and the rest are teleservice has a nice slightly
textured feel to it which i think is quite common across a lot of other tablet models
i've cleared up my desk out and i'm just gonna do a couple of quick size comparisons
the mobile studio is quite a lot thicker and heavier so now on to the review
I went ahead and download the drivers from the website which was remarkably easy to do
they commonly doesn't have that many different products yet so finding a right driver from tablet was pretty simple today
I've drawn him on this channel before he's kind of like this sparkly space tear thing that
what is plugged in and pretty much calibrates itself should a resolution of your screen one thing
I start by laying down some of the face colors of the character at this stage
I just put in some shadows and colors and I merge all the layers and now we're onto the painting
I'm using the keyboard I didn't end up using any of these Express keys throughout the drawing
that means that there is some space between where the screen is and the glass above it
start to happen in the next year or so as we have seen with some of these smaller
it's like an anti-glare film the screen isn't super glossy but you get some reflection on it
not overall it feels pretty good to drawn the film gives you some pen resistance not a ton
but just that little bit makes a big difference there is also a built-in stand well a semi built-in stand
one thing you probably noticed is there is a molded pen holder along the right hand side of the device
so you're never gonna be swapping batteries in and out or plugging it in to charge it
at what percentage of stroke smoothing has to turned on in order for this pen to lose its jitter in
Photoshop at about five percent is definitely cleaner when I bump it up to about ten percent
I feel like that's a good range that that's a quality line that I'm getting there
I straighten my lines a little bit so I can make them as smooth as possible
I'm looking for so in a nutshell the higher I turn up that stroke straightener the less accuracy
I have when I'm drawing so even though this pen did have some jitter to it
I think some people are really gonna like the little divot that depends sits in as far as cons
they've done a pretty good job with this and I hope they continued to make more and more devices
and that is kind of an issue if you're wanting to buy a professional tablet now
I understand it could be my computer or the driver and I'm sure it has something to do
I'm not 100% sure about that so one thing I've noticed is when I'm working at a smaller resolution
so if you're a big or an amateur and you use pretty small file sizes for your paintings
it didn't really work so it could be a driver problem or it could be the fact that
it also has an adjustable stand so you don't have to put out your neck when drawing
you can adjust the stand between 15 and 85 degrees and here you can also locate the reports
I know when I had to change the batteries from one of my other pens or is an inconvenience
the pen sensitivity also came on right away and I didn't have to spend time messing with it
the pen has 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity and gamma change this model from its previous versions
it makes it really easy to sign documents if you need to but since I predominantly use it for art
we have an eraser and a zoomin and zoom-out picture and on the other side by the end
they have a frequently asked questions that came in handy for me when the second time
but it's just second how to talk to your belt if you have the money though
let's say you get a job because you're practicing at the tools and you make a livable salary
I should go more in depth my opinions because I'm someone who if they like something
I just kind of say yeah that's good but I genuinely mean it but summer is my reasons
it's it's half of the price of an iPad and it's less than half the price of a galaxy
Wi-Fi so this is the speed Hut looks like right here how about if I do like this
it doesn't work if you with nails and it's well it's capacitive so you have it
so like this dual double multi double thing apple patents double doubles there you can zoom in zoom out
Next channel and then take the HDMI cable and I put it just in there and then I go in
who are looking for an alternative to the surface pro from Microsoft might be interested in this
you have a few processor options you can get it with a core i5 1.62 Hertz
I must say that this is one of the best tablet keyboards I have ever used
Pro's keyboard the trackpad is really nice and reminds me of that a B MacBook Pro
there's not as big of course but the look and feel of it is very close
the connector on top where it connects to the tablet is very similar to the surface pro
the tablet does come with an Intel dual band wireless AC with a 2x2 antenna and Bluetooth
4.2 it does have native marry cast wireless video support so those would be familiar with
what's on your screen directly to devices such as a Roku that support the Marrakesh protocol
IPS LED screen with the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 or you can get it with the optional
it is a little bit hard to see here but on the right side of the tablet
you have your front facing left stereo speaker and the screen size of the HP lex-2 1013
hi I'm Christian from mikeysoft calm and this is an Amazon fire tablet available in a choice of colors
this is a low cost medium spec slate which will set you back just fifty dollars in the box
the seven inch screen has a 1024 by 600 pixel resolution at 171 pixels per inch
Amazon music is also included with an 8 and a half hour battery your mileage may vary the Amazon fire
OS 5 is clearly based on Android but could do some work with the user interface
which can be pretty inconvenient when traveling also having an ad-supported version of this tablet is odd
although you can pay for the more expensive version and there's also the possibility of installing standard
This is Rina and in today’s video I’ll be making a review of the tablet H610 pro ver.2 from Huion.
This tablet is a bit special because it can be connected and used on Android devices!
On the back it has those little ‘anti-slip mats on each corner so it stays steady on the table.
The pen. It has no batteries so we can forget about having to recharge it every now and then.
It’s very light, I’d say a bit more than the usuals you see on Wacom tablets.
The hole on the back it’s the one we’ll use whenever we need to change the pen
And here are the OTG adapters that we’ll use to conect the tablet to an Android device.
Once we’ve downloaded them, we extract and run the file to start the installation which can take a while.
If we want to change the shortcut it’s as easy as hitting the Erase Chain button,
If you’re using more than one monitor just make sure to choose the correct one up here.
I’m honestly very surprised, I didn’t stumble any problems making it work with any of these four.
Pros about using this tablet on Android; no drivers installation, just make sure the OTG mode is enabled.
Theoretically it works with any type of drawing app but as you can see when I tried it on Medibang
as it should, the strokes would come out the same no matter how much pressure I applied.
Maybe it depends on the app and/or the model of the phone or tablet you’re using it with.
Remember to hit the Require Admin button before modifying them, otherwise they will react with the default ones.
It’s not something I’d probably use but I know there’s a lot of artists that are interesting
in getting a tablet that could be connected to their phones to be able to draw comfortably.
That’s four times the Huion’s price, plus those Intuos can’t be connected to Android devices yet.
Huion is definitely working on making their products better every time and competing with the most famous brand.
And we’ve reached the end of the review, I hope it was useful to all of you!
I’ll leave you the links down below to Huion’s website if you’d like to check it out.
this is blue with the teach entertainment and thank you for joining me for this awesome unboxing
this is the tablet of the day ripping this one from what i feel already this
you have the through buttons on top drawing space connector for a usb type-c or port for eva usb type-c
uh coming to um let's see what else giving a for it by the way i hope
you also have these sections which are more than likely to hold the pin case and so forth
like uh you have to feel them like this has some weight to it multiple 3d pen connectors
i mean imagine constantly drawing day in day out with your natural oils from your hand
thank you so much for checking out this unboxing this has been blue with sdgt entertainment
CC so I'll be showing my process for that as I share my review of the deco 0 3
and you can use it whether you're left-handed or right-handed there's a dial and six customizable
it's not super scratchy or anything like that and with smooth on just a bit in
throw it in a bag and not have to worry about the pen getting destroyed because it's not protective
there were work arounds for this however like using a darker color than I actually needed then
I could slowly ease up to my values and make these small incremental value changes easily
so who would this tablet be good for if you want an inexpensive reliable tablet that's portable too then
all you're doing is some quick calculations to be eco-friendly and basically you're just pushing around pixels on the display
there isn't an option to go in between so everything is wiped but with this version
you still need to use your camera for that so the packaging contents are extremely sparse
we have just a quick user manual and we have just the LCD writing tablet itself
we've seen but it gets a lot closer to the original boogie board as far as the color is concerned
it's a lot thinner compared to the same pressure here is going to be a bit brighter
and you'll see a red red light start to flash and when the light is flashing
and that's where the magic kind of happens and everything seems to just instantly fade away
this is technically a pressure-sensitive tablet so it might not be as good as say a
Wacom tablet for the purposes of drawing but again technically if you are an artist and you want to doodle
it doesn't cost too much back in the early days when the boogie board technology first came out
it has a lot of potential for success for places like schools and offices and eight point five inches
I was concerned about though is the display which is I think 1280 by 720 pixels per inch
not not the strongest viewing angles here if you used to see like your smartphone displays
Super AMOLED as well as very nice like LCD panels you will notice this on the tablet so serviceable again
I think it's an act on processor but the main issue I actually have noticed with
this tablet is in terms of the the Wi-Fi strength which to me doesn't seem to be that good really
it's not that strong doesn't have 5g support as well to you know where get quick downloads
I gave up the exert a insomnia IPS objects of screen a political year or a quad-core 64-bit

Giada mainly gonna Bob's alibi hitter is on what sorry about the other come here sufficient
and that's not really something you can do about aside from that it worked immediately the only thing
it has eight buttons that you can customize however you want it comes with a pen that is
it's kind of really nice and if you screw it open that's where the extra pen nibs are
yeah it has 2048 levels of pen pressure costs less than 60 euros in most countries
you'll notice right from the get-go it's crazy thin and crazy lightweight and the funny thing
in my opinion giving the feel and appearance of an upgraded device from a design and engineering standpoint
the a tab as two back sides are slightly beveled and although it is such a small design idea
s2 you increase your storage size up to a hundred and twenty eight gigabytes which is amazing which thankfully
I am glad the Samsung kept considering that both of their flagship phones have done away with them
but in landscape there is no question that you're blocking the bottom speaker with your palm
Samsung phones the Exynos 7420 but it is using the processor found in the samsung galaxy note
of course it's not as energy-efficient roughly a 10% slower clock speed or so and the
Tab s2 is using the familiar ddr3 ram while the newer phones are using the latest ddr4
I didn't notice this was any slower or faster than other premium tablets on the market regarding Samsung features
total time is one day in 28 minutes and screen on time was eight hours and one minute
there's no quick charging despite the same processor allows for Samsung's quick charging capabilities in their smartphones
Samsung's culture with itself for the past five years or so compare this to even the last generation tablet
this is what it looks like outside the case and it has hot key buttons at the top
if you prefer to use them next is a hand glove to protect your tablet from your hand greases
that is exactly the same tablet that I just unboxed but it has like a banana
duck image on the top of the tablet and it comes with stickers but even though it was cute
I used the pen tablet on and off for about two weeks while working on this image
it's perfect for traveling with because it's super flat to peck away easy and comes with phone adapter plugins
is that even though the hotkey buttons for the art tool shortcuts were available on the tablet
I didn't record the line art part because I wanted to mainly focus on the tablet usage
I just find it to be easier that way for me anyway to wrap this up
I hope you guys enjoyed the review and I hope you all have a good one take care you
so guys Lindsay and in this video I am going to unbox this box as you can see
SD card so I am going to go and turn on so this is actually the first very very first
we can see just took place with this tablet and as you can see this is actually ideal for children
if you want to go back to the children system layout you will need to go to here
so let me go into settings which as you can see we have 16 gigs and already used five point
five which is consists of the Android system and this tablet is a very reasonable tablet
I should say for those of you who have children and would want them to enjoy
I hope that is with yourself or to you and again guys the camera as well
I should say it's workable and you can still take out some decent pictures with this tablet and guys
and the idea is that this is to 2:39 or 229 for 8 gigabytes this is $1.99 for 16 gigabytes
and you're gonna see it's gonna load pretty fast so as I was saying right here
I just login to my name boos I need to login and then I have access to Skype in theory
I'm going to go into my website the Archos fans that come is browsing in a
HD browser and I'm really looking forward to I should get a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse
I just need to go and get one and I'll make another video when I have that
YouTube is gonna ban my video and I'm gonna try and go back to on a play recording right now
this where camcorder is recording 9 mega bit per second for 720 so I put it down
SC Wi-Fi or so none has Wi-Fi five now and performance of Wi-Fi is very good
I tested battery life with this app and performance is good much better than previous tablets
it's a little bit thicker than the most tablets that are out there it does run
I currently use an Android tablet so this was an easy one to get familiar with
I think all right that accidentally one day and a microphone microphone jack or an headphones
so you can plug your headset in as well as the charging port and on this side
if you get a doc for this tablet anyway you can dock it there in a nutshell
there's a couple of things which I'll show you on the inside because it is a little bit different again
you'll see it look quite a bit of room here and even if it's just to protect my thumb
I mean you look at where they've put this where they put this camera and that camera
so the key difference is they've added some apps which is sort of a lot better than
I guess your eternity to worry which is called right exact same exact same sort of thing
Google books in the Android store which is great Google Music hopefully in Australia at some point soon
Android manufacturers can differentiate themselves is with things like SD card slots USB ports full HDMI out
great because let's think about it you create a document on the laptop sync it up to Google Google
add for people who are buying if buying a laptop you get this for free score
I can think of, so yeah, that's a huge advantage for me and other drag players.
Finally there's this Warranty Card that warns you the warranty wears off after 1 year upon purchase, so that's nice.
by the absence of input lag combined with the nice touch the surface had to offer.
Also, thanks to these little rubber thingy there, the tablet sticks quite firmly to the desk.
You can find a more complete list of specification on the company's website, although I doubt osu!
So yeah, if you have sweaty hands like mine, you'll have to keep it clean and well maintained...
nibs it comes with, that's truely the cherry on the cake for me as a drag player.
simple review, if you have additionnal questions, that's what the comment section is for, and I'll see you guys later.
and then you know just glass on the front as you would expect from basically any tablet it feels ok
you can't really tell from the video but when I'm carrying it I kind of like carrying my tablets
you're good small hands not so good and I would say most most guys hands are bigger than mine
it has a resolution of about 1920 by 1200 so it's actually a pretty good resolution
but it's really nothing that's super bad so it's definitely good for example you're looking at this
I've showed you guys adventures before the audio sound so now I'll show you this one again
I think this should be about the same so in terms of like swiping and stuff like that
I mean I can live with that kind of speed but again it's it's not super fast
even though the rest of the tablet really isn't that great and that's gonna be bad news life
it was a mix of manga so not super intense but yeah so manga as well as candy crush
I didn't see any issues with them in terms of reception and range the location though
I don't know why that popped up again the Hilo p22 tea actually is a fairly decent chip for gaming
so that's why they have to make sure that the games work on from low end to high end devices
so yeah if you want a game you won't have a problem in this case so yeah okay
let's go and as you can see candy crush works very well and it's also super addicting
absolutely couldn't believe it but yeah but as you can see it works well so yeah no complaints there okay
I don't think this thing supports a fast charge and that microUSB port oh my goodness
tablet this is the way on h6 1-0 pro this is the competitor to Wacom Intuos tablet
I'm going to review this and show you how it is when it comes to drawing on different programs
and there's no tooth sensitivity so this is quite similar to Wacom Intuos the cheaper models on the left side
for example the first one is undo eraser brush zoom in zoom out the brush size increasing and decreasing
the buttons they are quite firm and they work very well this buttons by the way
you have to plug this into your computer using a USB port this is the USB port
this is battery power so you do need to charge it and to charge it there
the pen feels quite light and I think if used a bit cheaper it is quite quite strong
we have drawing smooth lines but here we've just had that the lines here are really very smooth
I think there is some problem with this particular software as I lift up the pen
my pen is off the surface and you can see that this line is still going and once
let's create this program and let's see where let's use this program called mischief right just now
this is actually an iPad app but it also have a version for Mac OS so
I wasn't able to test this up tablet with all the drawing software available of course
this is a so-called medium sized tablet so this is slightly larger than e5 if you were to buy a
I think is still worth it especially if you want to buy this for use with Photoshop
it should be good enough for most people but since my desktop is under my desk
you can change tablet area and both drivers which limits or expands the play area of your tablet
keep in mind that everybody has a different preference but here are my settings for my tablet so before
I show you that raw juicy gameplay let me talk about how the CTL 472 is for
it doesn't take up much space and I am really really satisfied with the $60 price point
Kari all the top of all the top of everything bossing there bossing even that gets worried
it's really cute next in the box is of course the tablet it was so much bigger than I expected
I'm not losing them because I have no idea what might have a double pink pen
I like having a button to save and I like having buttons that allow me to zoom in out
now this also comes with some little adapters that allow you to plug this in to your
Android phone or tablet and use it in art programs that you have on those and that's another thing
I'm typically a person who I tend to stand by Wacom products because I've I've used them for years
I would recommend this to absolutely any new starting digital artist or even any experienced digital artist
how much ever what you want it's going to have increased pressure sensitivity for your pen
Acrobat Reader DC signature Photoshop Illustrator ZBrush which I'm probably not gonna cover in this video
we're going to be looking at the accessory bag my apologies if the camera isn't really focusing that well
I've actually been a little bit different this time as a 90 degree bent cable style
which you probably won't need also now we're going to be looking at the tablet pen
the pen tip is nice and clicky nothing too special really and rubbery grip is what
I thought that was gonna be a bit of a concern but as I'm speaking right now
hopefully it's going to help make sure that the tablet doesn't slide around too much to drink
the height is almost the same for XP pengie 640 and the XP pengie 640 s
you say right here on the top left corner and right here on the bottom right corner
I just wanted to give you guys some of my final thoughts on this tablet g6 40s by XP pen
US dollars on Amazon this to some people maybe a little bit more pricey compared to
and if you're inclined please do feel free to leave a like or even subscribe to see more
I'm Aaron Rutten and today I'm going to be reviewing the Wacom One from a digital artist's perspective.
And although it's confusing, my guess is that perhaps there has to be some benefit to doing it this way.
like you might see in a tablet like the Samsung Galaxy Note. There is no touch capability.
This bezel design is a lot closer to the Pro Cintiqs in terms of bezel width.
Wacom's pen does not require a battery or charging and it performs much better than non-Wacom pens.
The pen only has one button rather than two, and it does not have an eraser.
As far as using other pens on the Wacom One, the Wacom One does not support other
I prefer the feel of the Wacom pen, but the Staedtler Pencil could be a nice option
There are two legs that fold out to bring the tablet to an angle of 19 degrees.
The legs are surrounded by a rubber grip, and the bottom edges of the tablet have rubber grip as well.
The Wacom One comes with a one year warranty and I'd say the build quality feels great.
The tablet does not flex much when you're bending it and the edges are smooth and rounded.
The Wacom One requires an HDMI video connection and a standard USB-A port for the data connections.
Once you've connected the Wacom One to your Android device you can open the Samsung Desktop
A phone or tablet could legitimately replace your desktop or laptop workstation for creating basic digital art.
All I needed to do was plug the tablet in and install the driver and it worked.
The Wacom One also comes with some bundled software. The software's only available for Windows 10.
There's CLIP STUDIO PAINT PRO which offers you a free license for up to six months.
You can also get Adobe Premiere Rush which is kind of a simplified video editing application.
And even if you don't like that bundled software you can get lots of great free alternatives such as Krita.
But it's neat to see that you can use this thing without having to plug it into a wall.
The Wacom One is a great starter display tablet for beginners or younger artists with smaller hands
who may also want to move their tablet between rooms or maybe even take it to school.
If you're a college student, you can connect it to your phone and use it to take notes during lectures.
Should you get the Wacom One or the Cintiq 16 which is a bit more expensive?
You can purchase the Wacom One using the affiliate link in the description of this video.
I was excited to try this at first, but my device is not supported so I can't.
Wacom offering an even more affordable display tablet because I believe non-display tablets are on their way out.
Now I know there's gonna be comments saying that there are Wacom alternatives that offer more for the same price.
Or you might get lines that are always wavy or have unexpected tapering when you choose a Wacom alternative.
So please be #DigitalArtSmart and watch some reviews before you buy a tablet and don't go off of specs alone.
because you know you're saving the paper the pen as well is nothing fancy you can see
I find that I actually really enjoy sort of playing around and writing on this tablet
you can see when I'm writing there's absolutely no lag just as soon as I'm pressing down
the display underneath is reacting and instantly my writings appearing on the screen which is pretty cool
absolutely no lag which is pretty awesome and you can see all you need to do to clear it off
and you're back to the start know with all that said as much as I do love this
save what you're writing so say you know you've done some beautiful picture and you want to save it
don't necessarily want to get some paper or anything or you know sharpen my pencils or whatever
hey everyone welcome to another graphics tablet review today we are going to look at the
this is the artists and T falling glove and this is the installation manual and Quick
the bit quality feels very solid matte surface texture is nice to touch and draw on
they call this the basil which you can use to rest your hand on it at the top left here
I did not measure the battery life so I cannot tell you how long exactly the battery will last
let me show you what you can do with the driver so you can change the pen pressure here
I have already installed the driver from Wacom so pressure now works this is me bank paint
if you want to change the brush size very quickly the lines they taper here with me
Bank really nicely I think the lines they taper path her a nice little compared to photoshop
I want them to be this is Krita on the map there is slight lag with Crete her
my thing is problem app and notice these angular lines when I'm trying to create smooth lines
I also get this sort of performance and Krita really is a bit buggy on the Mac
Mac it can detect pressure as well and it's very smooth and responsive this is affinity photo on the Mac
it really feels nice to draw on such a large surface and the pen is very sensitive
the company released a new version of its popular 10 inch tablet after waiting for two years
that one was up to 2 gigahertz while Amazon is not telling us the processor brand
I got the one with 32 gigabyte and all of the box you can use 25.5 2 gigabyte for yourself
I compared to that graphics performance and more detail in the Geekbench for compute and 3d
max slingshot extreme tests the Fire HD 10 scores quite a bit better than the Samsung tablet
I think real-life performance is great especially for its price single apps like Chrome YouTube and Netflix one smoothly
it's not as snappy as a high-end tablet but that's to be expected of course usually
I played it with some Microsoft Xbox wireless controller I've been testing and that works fantastic
yes not with the highest graphics but at least they do run which is important at this price
the design of the Amazon Fire HD 10 did not change in the last two years
a new feature is the USB C port that sits on one of the shorter sides
the cards can be up to 512 gigabyte in size on one of the longer sides
you can hear a real stereo separation which is great overall the sound quality is OK
both cameras have a resolution of 2 megapixels and both are capable of recording 720p videos
yes even for this price for video sheds its kind of acceptable but yes that's it
it has an aspect ratio of 16 by 10 and the full HD resolution was 1920 by 1200 pixels
it's brightness is good too not great but good and active stylus is not supported it does have the necessary
point one point one while it is an Android tablet Amazon is not mentioning Android anywhere
at least that's what benchmark tools are saying as the navigation buttons look like n-word 9 - we said that
even when the screen is turned off you can also activate the so called show mode once you do that
you will see ads on the lock screen if you're getting your tablet with the so called special offers
the most interesting competitor is the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 2019 it features a 10.1 inch full
performance is not as good as on the fire but in real life differences are not that big for most
prices vary a lot by country but usually it costs below $200 if prices are similar
and we've really pretty much every tablet there you can always find mine and our recommendations
this is not a half case but I think it protects the pen pretty well and this particular pen
so you do need to connect this tablet to your computer in order to use it
there's no driver disk included so you have to download the driver from their website view
there's no it doesn't look like a normal Mouse trackpad so it's just four additional shortcuts on the back
I prefer styluses that are more lightweight because I can draw more fluidly like I'm using a pencil
this is al shape so when you connect this to the tablet the cable is going to go up
when you're using the touchpad or the buttons here the light indicator will come on as well
so this is where you can customize the pen so for example if you want to customize the site button
this will slow down the cursor as you're moving you can toggle between pen and razor
and if you want to use the tablet as a mouse you can do so as well
it's a tablet and it's also less than 2 pounds super super light and a very competitive product
please don't take this to a concert and take photos of the concert goers yeah not very good picture quality
inch android tablet with a full HD IPS display 3 gigabytes around 32 gigabytes of storage
also six thousand milliamp hour battery which keeps this running for a long long time and it's running
Play Store as well so the Play Store pre-installed as well and overall it's just a really nice experience
it doesn't go particularly loud but they are nice clear speakers so good performance on the speakers
I should just a correction there 8 megapixels on the front and then 13 megapixels on the rear camera
if you've got kids running around for example you might miss the occasional shot but for to the most scenarios
good viewing angles quite glossy quite reflective but good color saturation and a really good resolution overall
and then if we look across the top here we've got a couple of sort of microphone
I think makes this a little bit better value so I'm really very very impressed with it
let's take a look inside the live chat we've got Alex Anderson in the live chat
that's just staying in touch with family or watching on demand or on the go very very true
very very nice tablet nice and slim line nice and portable and just really well designed
there are a lot of options out there when it comes to more affordable tablets and
I'm bringing you guys the review of the to ivx 3 7 inch android 4.2 tablet
so if you want to expand your memory from the 16 gigabytes that's already built in
you know chargers that's used on the s5 and the s4 and almost every kind of phone apart from apples
I really don't think it takes a genius to know that the two buttons like on the same hinge
the egg megapixel camera takes some really really great photos as you guys can see now
it performs really really good with the intense apps such as Real Racing 3 which requires a lot
6y5 seven at one point one gigahertz eight gigabytes of memory soldered in not replaceable and a 256 gigabyte
I don't have any of those to look at today but those will be coming out very shortly
I think to the Microsoft Surface pen all right so let's take a look at some web browsing first
ThinkPads are designed for doing work and I've got some work up on the screen right now in Microsoft Word
I'll take some images and move them around here and resize them as you can see
on some of those triple-a titles we got a score of three thousand five hundred and twelve
they have very similar processors so I think again for these kinds of games like Minecraft and other casual games
its edge it really is laying almost flat and that really does make a very big difference here so nicely
it's got a a nice rubberized backing here that has some texture to it and so we look in here
we have is the case which has a leather look and feel to it magnetic clasp
aren't that good but overall the screen is pretty sharp as you can hopefully see so
the keyboard is pretty good its full size it rides nice feedback and so if I type here
and it's mostly made out of plastic so the back besides the screen basically everything about this tablet
now keep in mind that if you take this outside there is a lot of reflection happening on the screen
it's good enough for typing or playing games or anything like that so much better than other tablets that
mostly whenever you're doing those benchmark tests as for the internal storage out of that 64 gigs
I think it's worth it but if you have more money you can get something better
at all now you're gonna have to use a full sized umm sync or something that
but you're gonna look something like this so the microphone is sitting somewhere at the bottom here around
the screen gets crashes very very easy so if you use anything else but your finger
then it takes a few seconds to load the page and so on so everything is done in slow motion
we even have a front facing camera and a rear camera and the cameras will do fine for video calling
great alright guys hopefully enjoyed this video if you did like it press that like button
The truth is, unless a person has reviewed multiple tablets, they are not a good source of information.
Over time, these companies become more demanding about what the artist or reviewer should do in their video.
At the time it didn’t seem so crazy but now that I’m talking about it - wow. That’s devious!
Now for the juicy details - let’s discuss what kinds of things I’ve been asked to do.
The only thing they ask in return is a review and links to the product’s store page.
Some companies will ask you to send them the review video before you post it online.
Once in a while a company may send you a tablet directly from, say, China, instead of your country’s Amazon.
At least with reviews you get important information to potential customers and receive a tablet you can use or sell.
But by far the worst thing that ever happened to me was getting duped into doing product testing for free.
And because I received a beta version of the tablet, it didn’t come with its official box or accessories.
First, make sure you ask for the review rules the first time you work with any company. Second, negotiate.
How are they going to know if you left a five star review on Amazon or not?
Thank you for listening, and I hope this video will help you make good reviewing choices in the future.
the resolution just quite isn't up to par with some of the really high-end Android slates on the market
so you do end up with a better audio experience on the note 10-1 and any other tablets
what you see on the front here is also a 1.9 megapixel front facing camera on the sides
we have the power button volume rocker a micro SD card slot nice and easily accessible card slot
it gives a nice look to the OS it also enables some proprietary features not offered on other tablets now
you can see there's plenty of widgets already loaded up but the device is very responsive
you'll actually be able to have two apps running side by side so here you see the browser
now we should point out although you're seeing both apps they're not exactly both running here so
I mean s note if I come back to the browser did you see that lag
Adobe Photoshop Touch and Polaris Office now these are all applications optimized for use with the S Pen
if you're doing multi-screen you just have more control with the s-pen it's not a game changer
xbox controls have material inlays providing additional support and prestige finish to the design for the elite performers additional
the only sellers are in the UK and they will not allow shipping to the United States
so you don't need to worry about picking up any type of an adapter for the tablets
once it's cradled gives you access to the headphones and a microUSB port for charging the cradle features
B Y buttons that are lit up the cradle is comfortable to hold and hand grips feel really good
you're reaching for the bumper trigger while you're using the sticks or pressing the face buttons
if you have any questions please leave them in the comment section below feel free to rate comment and subscribe
particular camera is that it can do a hundred and 40 degree panoramic view with the software
but the great thing is soon as you connect it to Wi-Fi there's a free upgrade to version 7.0
you wouldn't choose a keyboard style and then hit next enter your Wi-Fi password and then connect it once
you're going to have to have a gmail account installed from this screen you can choose
once you select that hit continue and then confirm it and this is where you can redeem your
Google's Drive offer all you do is press redeem go to your email account and accept it now
your setup is complete and then press ok now you know how to set it up
let go and there's a clock to get rid of it hold it drag it over
I just want to show you guys just to outline in the software but there's so many features in it
okay now let's take a listen to the built-in speaker and I'm gonna try some headphones on
I'm not gonna go through the whole process but I'll show you what the app looks like
this rather large plastic door pulls up a little fiddly killer with that little plastic legs on it
we're still waiting for a software update for the Motorola Xoom to add the SD card slot
we see a places like fries there the COBE tablet and even nicer than the viewsonic
I would like it to go a little higher than it does other than that there
you can see that the Acer is a bit wider it has larger bezels on it
a miniaturised things so one of the ways that Acer probably was able to make this more
well if we look from that side where the Motorola does have bells then the Acer
it should show up on our shelf and this takes you just keeps you in that contained environment over here
look but you're still inside of the application so let's find something freaky in the public domain section
I'll go back to our book shop and see if it's there and indeed there it is
there's a night mode over here and that's pretty much it for features in this reader
now you can side load books into Lumiere II but what you need to do first and sit down
we've got a couple of books here and this gives you a little bit more about flashy looking layout
but they're saying if you do that you can just turn your pages like so okay
they have four honeycomb with the really dude videos over here in information and controls and this material over
don't have to feed back but you do get auditory feedback fast and responsive we've got pinch zooming here
2 obviously you get to play real flash on this which is nice and also the
if you've got a tab browser you can switch between the tabs quite easily performance is very good
it's metal you have the teclast logo the m89 logo and pretty much a couple of indicators
someone back here you have your teclast logo your m89 logo and here on the side
you can hold on to them pretty easily with your with with your fingers no problem unless you're like
actually you know notice a difference and care about it which is very important but for me
there is a feature in this which is called night mode which pretty much yellows the screen so
even if you play something with bass or you're watching stuff with explosions it sounds tinny
let me type a little bit for you here that that's really strange and I'm not sure was going on
let's put it that way so let's listen to the audio and see what we got
though is very good the standby battery life was something of quite a wonder as you can see
I think six days and it dropped maybe like thirty percent which is very very good
there's really not much to say about that and I am perfectly happy with Android 7.0
it's definitely a lot smoother than the chewy high nine that one was not very well optimized
it's fine but if you start opening too many apps you start seeing the problem and here
so there's that this is a pretty fun game actually so it's not bad and as you can see
nothing has complained about there so in conclusion the teclast m89 is a very very good tablet
we're going to be taking a look at the connect X 10.1 inch quad-core calling tablet
so this tablet is available from tequila com4 1975 rep and that link is provided in the description below but
it has a two and a five megapixel camera respectively and has productivity communication and social media
whatever the heck that supposed to be so out the box what do we get first thing is enough
all right and then there's some other manuals and stuff that doesn't really interest us at this point
it has a built-in microphone as well as dual speaker capabilities and in Wales 560 grams
I actually started off with the full each with a full charge on Thursday evening and on a Tuesday morning
it actually kept up with me so some of the cons so the the biggest con corner
I'll be in the comments chatting to you and letting me you know what I think of your video ideas
taking it out of the box we can see that it already has a pre-installed screen protector
surface at the bottom of the tablet is where you see the two speakers at the left side
i've tried using my finger and two styluses but the lines remained uneven to test it out further
what this does is lessen the animation speed when you're scrolling or opening apps which makes your device move faster
this is when i already applied the precise flick that is why its much smoother to draw
I know before you guys go ahead and scream and rage quit and leave comments down below
you go from a smooth kickstand to a gritty back and then back to a smooth bezel
I can't say that it will bend or not but I'll let you be the judge of it
this isn't exactly the specs you'd expect from an android tablet but how well it performs is most important right
since it's the same device as the 10-inch one would assume that it runs the exact same way
that's when the yoga flexes its muscle as expected all games ran smooth from dead trigger to
there isn't an app drawer and the quick settings are located at the bottom via a menu
once you take only a few shots you can quickly see what the camera has to offer
images let color grain is evident even in decent lighting and the shutter is pretty slow
I was able to get better shots but that was after adjusting a lot of settings prior to the shot
these settings need to become your best friend for video the camera is able to shoot at full
the microphone is decent and it picks up your voice pretty well and that's about it now
Edition not sure if it's software or what it is but it actually is a decent tablet that
I don't mind picking up and using as always guys my name is Kevin the tech ninja
there's a lot of tablets out there but this one is filling budget price 19 around 99 pounds
so here's the tablet in the box you get the tablet and a charge here which is micro
USB ok so here's a tablet just signed in with my Google account and nice clear bright screen
there's also a - cloud as well for storing stuff on the cloud but I tend not to use of
I just tend to use the standard Android services and drop boxes on there as well
but it's not too bad it's usable and certainly the 2 megapixel camera is usually on tablet
I mean I don't really want to take pictures on a tablet to be honest II
here's one I prepared earlier so here's a YouTube video and this is pretty good for watching videos
Windows tablets alone but if you want an Android tablet this is a good option at 99 quid
alright thanks for watching this video and simple and clear link to the written review on live.com
Excel calm and in this review you will learn for who is this as a perfect tablet before we started
the most important feature of the Lenovo Chromebook is Chrome OS a couple of years ago
Chrome OS is very easy to navigate both by touchscreen and by keyboard and mouse in tablet mode
you can open several apps and three floating windows just like we're used to from windows
for instance there's no animation when scrolling through the gallery just nothing major of course just some things that
that means that recognises how hard you press down the pen is well supported by Chrome OS when using it
handwritten text looks clear if the pence react faster but especially when considering how inexpensive this tablet is
I wouldn't get it just for the stylus though if the pen is the most important feature for you
the lenovo dread chromebook is powered by a mediatek helio p680 octo-core processor with 4 gigabytes of RAM
word tablet like the Galaxy Tab A six life though exactly this is what I can say about
if you don't want to work with your tablet it might not be suited for you though
and if the pen is very important for you you should check out the competition too
it's much pricier though alright is at the end of my review of the lenovo - a chromebook
if you have any questions write them down below and subscribe to the channel as i said
thank you very much so as I said this is an 8-inch Android tablets this is running
Android 9.0 Pi and its stock Android or vanilla Android so no bloatware which is great
nothing on the bottom nothing on the left side and the top has your headphone jack micro
it's not going to feel like a heavyweight in your hand which is a good thing
which is good and it doesn't have any blower which is a big positive for me
I appreciate it and you can also check out my social media which is Instagram and Twitter
depending on where you live so i think that's the european one this one is the uk one
and that's how you attach your tablet power to the to the pluggy thingy this is the stand
there's no eraser but there are these two express keys and it does feel like a really nice pen
i thought could be a little better like there wasn't a whole lot of um choice in that
that happens like i've heard so many weird things about wacom's modern tablets that i just
so i haven't used it with anything else so it might not be compatible with certain programs
so it's not a pen is just a stylus earbuds which are fine charging cable you get a micro
SIM actually says on though if you can see it you put a nano SIM into this
it's a true sim and you also can put a micro SD card in it as well
so you do have to watch out for scratching so it's advisable to put the screen protector on
ok so you can see that we're now connected to the whole network and obviously when
we can see actually an operation with the video going you can listen to the sound
but if you have a look up you've got your Wi-Fi so you click on to there
I will turn it off vehicle 20 volume those you can hear and that is you can see the motion
Euler here welcome to a new channel and don't be reviews so for our first review
it has the Android Oreo it has a 10.1 HD IPS multi-touch has 2 gigabytes of RAM
also it comes with 16 gigs of hard drive but you can expand it with an SD card
alright so let's take it out of the plastic so my first impression is it has big bezels
I really don't like it's the camera position so a lot of people use tablets nowadays in the portrait position
so it's not really the best position for a camera to be in a tablet also
part of the tablet so far is looking pretty with a pretty decent quality so the quality is pretty average
so it's not really a good quality camera it's just work a very specific usage so finally
I wasn't expecting it to be like this good so overall what I'm most like about
so if you're using it with one hand or you just laying down in bed it's not gonna bother you
you also have a micro SD card slot that to add up to 128 gigabytes of storage
as well camera on the front is 2 megapixel and there's a camera on the back that's five megapixel which
they also have a kid's version of this tablet as well if you have a kid inside the box
another cool thing you can do is you can actually run two windows at the same time
you go playing a video surf from the web at the same time now if you play a game
and there you go watching a video surfing the web so it is doable on here
if you want so pretty cool that you can do all that stuff with this tablet next up
it's not going to be a speed demon in terms of performance and that's not really what it's supposed to
it's not amazing amazing but for 129 bucks for a kid or for an older person
plays a game absolutely fine and then just to show you how it web surfs not by multitasking
I mean it's it's not the best-performing tablet and it's not supposed to be it's 139 bucks
button recent apps button and then you also have a screenshot button dedicated which you can so
like when you go in a display you can come in here and you can turn off that screenshot button
I think they call it all right so my dad just called cut my video off
I can zoom into the exact serial number and you can't really press too hard and this
yes so this basically gives us some dimensions but again the rest is just some lines very nice little so
I think we're done with the with the general stuff and yes so let me bring in the can
i mean not too bad so basically what this is is one of those boogie boards with a battery right
and if you do it right you do have some pressure control which is pretty cute and now
I've made a line here where I pressed on the screen and left a lot of on it
it's locked so that's probably just in series with the lock button and yeah so again lock
I would have enjoyed if it would disable this but I think this is completely passive somehow requires out actually
let's check right so technically if you remove the battery we would expect to get no more pressure recognition
I mean that doesn't make much sense right so I guess right what you would do with
it doesn't really have a show me media media or writing down super-slippery so that's pretty interesting
it is pretty slow so right now you haven't seen it be slow and I don't mean the e-ink right
Phone a rock on brother rock on like there's not many it's not many of you left
all right yeah so these are totally different products right this you actually do take notes of so for example
which is is yet to be released so this might actually come out come out faster
there's layers so this is nice stuff right and again all this stuff we do have a little
well it says it's connected so no anyway and I do have the coolest Wi-Fi name anyway
then there's the motherboard and that connects to this place so absolutely no no like super hard to service stuff
and this is a first-gen unit right so this was made in 2017 this was ordered with on
Kickstarter right so was a pre-order so this this came out super nice the buttons still are super clicky
so the answer insanely fast and the people are extremely reliable and knowledgeable so that was incredibly nice
this is like the first round of production so the fact that it is done so nicely is is very
Etsy for example some you could probably ask the people to make your handmade one for less than 90 euros
I had the remarkable for like a few weeks and this I've had for a few minutes
OEMs haven't thought of moving the power and volume to the short side for larger size tablets
the remaining ports are in typical locations with the microUSB on the right 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
the tablet has never shut down on me or ceased operation of an application and even though
the z4 tablet offers manual equalizer controls and surround sound effects for that perfect listening experience now
the quality of the speaker's themselves is actually quite good and really tops off the media experience
Sony with a very clean and easy to use interface and among these standard modes like superior auto and manual
Sony's Xperia Y which is arguably still one of the better Android skins out there the Xperia U
Sony mobile products z4 tablet also includes PlayStation integration to remotely play ps4 games directly on the tablet
I would say we would see an increase in the screen resolution or adding some touch features
fiver my dream of making my ultimate game may finally come true they've partnered with phase

Yan has been experimenting with things like Android support and also the look of these displays
you can see pretty well in my videos because I have a lot of lights shining above
but when you just have it on your desk and you're sitting in normal lighting conditions
I tried several other apps on the mag just to see if I could replicate the problem affinity designer clip
and there's also a pen holder that comes with some extra nibs tucked inside and yes
these days in fact most have shipped with one of these cables over the last several years
the port is not flush with the side of the device like it is on lapped
that means the plastic edge of your cable has to be really narrow to fit into that space
I tried a bunch of different cables to find one that would fit and I did find one problem is
look for a good cord with a good transfer rate that could also pass power and I bought
and since it required the same kind of cable in order to test all of these new Android features i
it works fine with a pen but I will admit I really wish this had a touchscreen
and years of muscle memory drawing on android and specifically decks here is hit or miss for example sketchbook
all index other apps like one feature or another that would make them more useful for example art flow
the keyboard appears on your Android tablet or phone off to the side and not on the screen itself
these are just some of the growing pains that come with adopting a new interface so like the
I think this cable problem is gonna cause a lot of people headaches anybody who tries to use those
so if you have any comments or questions let me know down below in the comments
and that's what we will find out in this review the design and big quality of
it might sound a bit weird but the blade quality really is excellent in this price range
the viewing angles are wide enough to see something when looking from the sides it is
you can see my benchmark comparison that the performance of the tap m7 is very bad
the graphics performance don't work the performance in real life is as bad as a benchmark suggests no matter what
the tab m7 is not a gaming tablet of course very simple games do run however
Google Maps Co and the assistant go these are simpler versions with few features that run better on weak platforms
I'm always looping the same HD video ad million brightness until the tablet shut themselves off
but it's important that you know that you will have to make compromises in this price
even though it's even cheaper worse prices starting at just 50 dollars it does feel a bit faster
N word you've got to live with Amazon's version which does not include the Play Store
Google Android 8-inch HD screens and much better performance all right at the end of my Lenovo tap m7 review
if you have any questions please feel free to write them in the comments and subscribe to the channel
Hamlet the only other tablet up until now that did this was their 10 inch version
OS 6 which is the new version of Amazon's operating system now this is derived from Android
so if you have a lot of media to put in you can get it in there
so let's take a look now and see how it performs and we'll begin with some basic web browsing here
this is partly due to the fact that the processor is getting a bit long in the tooth
it's not even running at 720p here at least from what my eyes see so it's really not an ideal
YouTube experience and a lot of the features you might get from an official YouTube app
and it's noticeably faster than any of the other services that are available on this platform now
you can get emulators to play some of those old games or you can download remakes like this one
likewise you can also do it from up on your pull down control panel there so it's pretty cool
it's not the fastest thing in the world that feels a little more sluggish to me than the prior editions
I've got a five-year-old in a two year old the five year olds iPad is smashed to bits

I'm not going to add all of these accessories so like I mentioned for the tablet itself
it's got a 7 thousand milliamp hour battery and they're claiming 10 plus hours of usage
we also have that video out like I mentioned and dual stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos
and here's a look at the unit fully assembled we have the kickstand cover and the keyboard
some people will think about buying this over an Android tablet if you're looking for a strictly Android tablet
Tab s6 light but if you absolutely have to have Chrome OS built-in for school or work
this is a great option along with Chrome OS and the ability to run Android apps
Linux apps if you go into the settings you can enable the beta of Linux on Chrome OS and overall
if we look at the tab s6 light we did score a bit higher and keep in mind this is
Vulcan but as you can see the tab s6 Lite beat out the duet once again
you can install hulu amazon prime disney plus and all kinds of different apps through the Google Play Store here
it looks great and playback is fine as long as you have a decent internet connection
I figured we'd go ahead and give that a test here we have Minecraft Pocket Edition
I'm set to 10 chunks and I have fancy graphics off when I just blew up all of that dynamite
I recommend an Xbox one controller over Bluetooth so I got to give it to Lenovo here
this is meant to be like a slightly higher end version of their other 16 inch tablet that
compared to the other tablet that's only 450 now $50 difference is not a whole lot
then the screen itself is really not that much better and as its overall the same technology across the board
and it will scratch up if you remove the film and the initial activation of the pen
I need to explain the iPad a little bit before I get a ton of hate comments
but it's not enjoyable at all and it's probably because it's going to be some big flaw in the device
yeah there you go as long as the tablet is in the purple the brown or the dark green section
I just feel like it was a missed opportunity to really branch out from their regular series into something
so let's stick in tablet mode so as a tablet it's supported rotation all the usual stuff
it's quite light this about the same way as a surface pro 3 to its profile
that goes with the video as well but use it as a as a tablet really nicely
it's very it's got nice smooth curved edges it feels nice and smooth in terms of port
use data when you're traveling so if you've got them what you can get them what we can get it
it takes a lot to get it to click back down again so on your lap
which gives you plenty of grunt it's got eight gig of ram and a 256 gig
so this thing is nice and fast and smooth tasks with flipping between tasks is really easy really fast
tried some other tablets and this perhaps from the surface pro 4 is the best one
I've use the Dell XPS is a such a sort of Express 15 which is similar
but has all the bells and whistles search no more let me introduce you to the van
I love to read in even more so I love the black and white look to reduce eyestrain
I chose my external speaker this time so we can listen together while getting some work done
for graphic artists around the world and today we have the hue ion 1060 + graphics drawing tablet
Homs line of tablets specifically the Intuos Pro M mainly due to the similarities in size and pressure sensitivity
it is important to note that it's slightly smaller and lighter than the end but in real world use
the pen is battery-powered and does require you to charge it every so often with the provided cable
Wacom has a bit of an edge here in terms of comfort especially for extended drying periods
it shouldn't be any issue for most people but we can see this being irritating to some artists
Wacom tablet if you can afford it and while Hugh ions offering doesn't outshine its competitors
I can say with utmost confidence that the human tablet will be the same for any budding artist
don't forget when it comes to tech the tech ventures are there we got your back
Android tablet available now cost five hundred fifty bucks so it's not really cheap but you know
Fujitsu they make things that are pretty bulletproof and their aim towards corporations honey good stuff your IPS
really thin very sturdy has some milspec tests it only weighs one point to three pounds
we're gonna look at it now the Fujita stylistic m 532 is available now this is the US version
I'm a little bit concerned about the price on this guy compared to other tablets on the market
I'd certainly the whole piece feels very sturdy even though it's been IPS display 1280 by 800 standard resolution
microphone nothing on this side and as we take a look at the back soft touch black feels good
I say Fujitsu did a reasonably good job of optimizing the tablets performance on quadrant and scored a 4605
the very glossy a durable despite as Fujitsu points out is really very to lay upon
what was our own website so you can see how that loads smooth enough page them in good works fine
we have the standard gallery application that comes with every Android device that's fully Google certified
yeah well test on 1080p video playback now one of our test movie trailers 1080p high profile
but if you're going to use HDMI via the optional $70 doc and makes more sense
it's not a Tegra 3 effects in effect and the Fujitsu plays the game just fine
the tablet is there's not a whole lot of room for battery inside so that's this
you're gonna have to download everything yourself so for folks who are kind of new to tablets
Nvidia graphics has two gig of ddr3 system memory and 32 and 64 gig internal storage variants
and that's it in terms of connectivity with the exception of the standard sink in charge port
this is a Seuss's patented super IPS plus display with 600 minutes of brightness again windows
this is a very thin and light tablet looks a lot like the transformer series of Android tablets from
let's take a look around a little bit and show you what it's made of all right so again here
you've got a couple of mounting holes as well as that standard sink in charge port right there again
please do not mind the reflections and the black screen as we're booting up here as you can see the
I can touch getting travel and bang them into being travel so pretty impressive application switching here
obviously some basic gestures are here and they're fairly standard and common between a lot of tablets
Microsoft has bundled with ASUS Microsoft Office 13 and for Windows RT Home Edition and student edition
RT we've got word we've got Microsoft Excel as well as Microsoft Publisher running all here on the desktop
and we'll fire that up now it's called hydro thunder hurricane and incidentally the tablet does support wireless
I'm Dave out Davila from hot hydro make sure you stop by our site for the full review
there are also adapters to connect your tablet to an Android which I do not have so
I decided the best way to break in this new tab was to do a be more chilled inspired piece
Express keys that I ended up using a bit like a saving shortcut which is very convenient
I have the page up here so I can see here comes in the red which is what I have
do a tried to do an unboxing of this but that didn't go too well for me
I would say negative about this is I wish it came with like a rubber grip
these days are going to type-c connectors just because they're so convenient they can do a lot
and the best thing is they're reversible so you can plug it in any direction especially with this 90 degree
now my experience with that was obviously a little interesting just because me and these kind of tablets
it's a very good tablet for 50 bucks for the fact you get to 12 keys the USB type-c connector
it's just a really good tablet so if final thoughts are I really like this tablet for 50 bucks
I can highly recommend this tablet for anyone whether you're a beginner intermediate or even advanced
it's just a nice tablet to have especially if you're needing space-saving but anyway that's beside all the point
thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video later
we have the warranty card the Uni comes with a one-year warranty and these are all the contact information
this pen supports slightly over a thousand levels of pressure sensitivity the pen also supposed to sensitivity
I'll put some links in the video description below to where you can find this online
we have these parallel lines that run across and four rubber feet so even the back looks really nice
so if you want to use that tablet as a big trackpad you can do so by turning that on
life indicator crayon says the tablet can last up to 20 hours non-stop while you are charging that habit
it's very responsive very sensitive and there is no lag at all the initial activation force
it's very light so you can draw really light without pressure to get those thin lines very easily
it's very responsive so no issues here at all and this is Photoshop so there is noticeable input lag by
so let me try and reconnect this and see if I can get the connection again
the finishing is very well done the rounded corners the matte texture surface throughout and this surface
the transition is very smooth when it comes to drawing curves corners the curves the very smooth
I have not tested this on Mac OS so for any updates on its one performance with Mac OS
I have tested tablets from other brands that also work Android and the performance has always been mixed back
by the way lenovo has been releasing cheap 7-inch tablets regularly in the last couple of years
some are still available among its predecessors are the Lenovo Tab 3 7 and Lenovo Tab 7 essential
if you own an almost 7 inch smartphone that one will have a much higher pixel density but actually
sometimes it can take about a second and their text is too loaded properly and look sharp
the graphic self to be set to its lower obviously but because of the bed screen
did release updates at fixed bucks and so already though I quite like Android go on GT p7
at first glance you don't notice that it is a simpler version of Android compared to standard ones
there are some minor differences only for example the backbone of the app drawer has a solid color
it is also missing a split screen view so you cannot open through app side by side
I did notice one negative thing about N word go or at least the Google keyboard
we kind of get vanilla and word here and that is great there are a couple of apps pre-installed
Gmail you get G Meiko additionally there is a youtube goal Google assistant go and the maps Co app pre-installed
so it's a simpler versions that one well on here the only go apples a huge design differences
happy seven we get a battery with a capacity of 2,750 milliamp hours because of its low resolution screen
even though it is cheap it should be at least usable and that is the case here
I also like Android go in psycho apps most other aspects are not that good though
here well the tap is 7 is very cheap and it's just $50 you cannot expect high-end hardware again
however if you can spend around $30 more you will be able to get a much better device
it is fine for simple tasks to among its few differences as amazon's version of Android
the tablet has 12 buttons on the side and 2 on the pen so far it feels nice when
the two buttons on the pen are fully customizable and under the pen option you can assign their functions
the tablet has a drawing area of 10 by 6 inches or that is 25.4 by 15 point 24 centimeters
the tablet design allows it to be friendly to both left and right hand users rotate the tablet 180 degrees
I've already made one drawing with it and it was not that much of a problem for me
I can easily see myself putting down the function there that I would use more often
I also had to restart fire alpaca because the pressure was not working but after restart everything was fine
I would have loved to have a pen stand with it so I'm gonna go with 4 out of 5
even though it's in a really weird style the tablet did help me a lot in the drawing here
it is listed for $88 on Amazon and still goes for $99 on the Microsoft Store
I will leave both links below in the description so you can go ahead and check it out
because it's pretty eye-catching so on the box it reviews some features like the Microsoft Windows 10 32-bit version
and the back you'll see more in-depth specification and there's only one color in that silver
the five megapixel rear camera is positioned on the top far-right the front features the capacitive windows
this is good for storing documents photos and a few videos to watch on the go
the tablet uses a 2 amp charging brick which charges the tablet completed within two to three hours
this also allows for you to connect the mouse to it for more precise control or a keyboard
if you want to go wireless you can use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse on it
so it won't decrease your battery that much the Wi-Fi ban on this is only a 2.4
is that because of how thin this tablet is it is a bit slippery and to me
if you want this specifically for gaming you are better off saving your money and investing it
maybe in a higher-end tablet you can still play less intensive games on this you can run
I think the a inch display is an ideal size this is easy to carry around and runs efficiently
it is a 10-inch or I don't know if it says it on the box here
I'm going to open this sucker up ten inch or two gig ram and 32 gigs of storage
Keogh is you don't have to worry about bloatware and stuff like that as much as you know the
I got this because I can throw in a bunch of movies onto a very large SD card
Android tablets watch them you know and and not be device constrained like I am on iPads microUSB
I think that the responsiveness is maybe just a little bit snappier here on the Amazon
on inspire 320m drawing tablet which is a dual purpose drawing and writing tablet by dual purpose
its active area is nine into five point six inches it is written here in millimeters five zero zero
and these are the contents of the box so this is a just a thank you note
it also has a button basically two keys you can assign different features to it using the software
OTG for connecting the device to mobile phones and this is the connecting cable USB cable
you can assign functions to the two keys of the pen and also you can check the pressure sensitivity
I am a righty so I am keeping it as zero degree after doing any changes
so this is how you can draw quick sketches on it and or create doodles or write notes
and don't forget to give a like to this video as well and let me know in comments
you should also know that there are two additional games called dudes big adventure and pictionary
because obviously you get to draw your own clues and and you combine that with your big screen
after opening up the sealed box at the table itself they got a big 10.1 inch tablet
Dean and Phil was pretty good at the left that is NSYNC car and a memory card slot
it's an 16gb variant and 2 GB RAM I have updated some app but still 15 GB spring
with this tablet some other things about this tablet that might interest you are has 2 gigabytes of RAM
it's gonna be what you see on this display and it stands out right at you
I said the sound is pretty darn bad and I'll play a song real quick here
this is gonna be an ad but just jumping around if you want to use it for some browsing
obviously it'll do that because it's a tablet from Android and it does a pretty good job
obviously it can do all that so you can view your Instagram stories or just use Instagram overall
I mean I wouldn't go crazy and play pub G or fortnight but you know games like this
so when you go in here you're gonna have access to all of the features that Android 8.1
hey everybody its Andrew and this is my unboxing and review of the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet 3rd
we'll get to that excellent keyboard cover in just a little bit some documentation warranty information as well
Pro at no additional cost it uses the Wacom AES technology 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity
you get your extension cord and your 65 watt power adapter which uses USB type-c now
you get your power button as well as your volume rocker up and down now as far as those
a special 21 percent discount code just for my viewers for Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows 10 Professional OAM Keys
a nice blend between getting worked on as far as productivity and consuming media such as Netflix and YouTube
one you can look at now you will notice the side bezels as well as the top and bottom chin
I have no real issues with the pen I thought it worked really well comparable of course to that surface
of course it also depends on whether you're gonna get it with 8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM the more
that's not what this is for so just bear that in mind now as far as thermals are concerned
a 65 watt power adapter in the box so this is the front-facing camera on the ThinkPad x1 third gen
I am curious to know although it's not a Windows hello camera keep that in mind now
they're too quiet now they are Dolby Atmos speakers so you can tune them within software wise but really
I love the fact they give you the pen and the keyboard in the box and speaking of keyboards
now the negatives here are it's like toaster battery life of course as well as the lackluster speakers
I'm not happy with the speakers or the battery life on this but everything else is really excellent
although this did very well obviously as you can see from those results we showed in the video
stand there great on it so it's been put through 12 different tests to show its endure
it can be an expensive of course but then again you're paying for the quality you get into beautiful display
let me know in the comment section below so please hit the like button please subscribe
I'm doing let me know if there's a device or something out there you think I should review
so hopefully it should be safe so we're going to have a quick look around the box
there's a tablet pc on the side and shows you what it can do play music play video play games
we're going to see how easy it is to start up so basically you turn it on for three seconds
that away is if you want to connect a keyboard or something like that to it you can through bluetooth
uh oh there's your second sound recorder that's quite good calculator maps calendar youtube language and click free
let's see if we can install the game and see how easy it is to work
i've got a lot of light going on at the moment for the video so i need to find something
so look a bit wishy-washy but like i said you can't expect it'll be fantastic keyboard video
we're gonna be taking a look at lenovo's newest affordable 7-inch budget tablet the tap m7
Lenovo and I'm actually having a hard time on understanding why and who this is made for
I know that the holidays are coming up and the only thing I can think is
I wish we could get something like this with a higher end chip like even the Snapdragon 820 now
I know that chips getting old but it still performs pretty well with the stuff that I want to do
Go Edition and that's actually one of the best things that's got going for it now
a gig would have helped out tremendously so overall this device is still pretty close to stock
this is a very low-power chip in here and a lot of the games aren't gonna run at full speed
optimized app and it actually loads up a lot faster than most of the other apps that
I've been using Geekbench four for a long time so I kind of wanted to keep it
I'm only about 12 feet from the router itself on a 2.4 gigahertz network download 41.7
I did have to set everything to medium but the game is fully playable on this
I wanted to get some emulation out of the way I went with Playstation one now SNES Sega Genesis
game boy game boy advance is gonna work great on here either using retro arch or the standalone emulators but
now with video playback it works pretty well but you gotta wait for that loading some lower end
emulation will work but even the lower in native android games that i tested are a bit laggy
so it's definitely not made for gaming and it's really hard for me to recommend this to anybody
now some people say this is a for girls but it's unisex obviously well nice blue cover unisex girls boys
and this is what it's for it's a android 1.3 gigahertz chip only 16 gigabytes of storage is wi-fi
this is one year of amazing free content but nowhere when you set up the device
here is a storage bay so you can chuck in more ram if you wanted to
so i'm guessing you've got to put your own media on there reading books loads and loads
if i i'm going to start playing this tablet with some of these special ones on here keep going down
there's your box the media or your camera you're learning and of course the other one now
my boy is one half years old and the only thing he knows to do how to do with
this tablet currently is tap so if he's the age of my boy you need to find tap games
want the best things best firms best tablets but at the age they are now very very young
and things like that so getting in one of these it would have the games on them
one a big screen experience in an older vehicle with its price tag of a thousand us dollars
because pioneer provides this lighting cover the screen is a high definition 9 inch wide powered by leds
this is pretty cool but for some of those features you have to have i datalink maestro
you can access the favorite page where you can add your favorite radio stations swiping down on the home screen
you can adjust the volume of the map apps guidance along with the main sound source very handy feature
now it's time to do a quick walkthrough to the settings and see what's new here
and very easy to set the values and everything very intuitive switching to the video setup
i hope you find it helpful and if you are interested in this kind of content
it's a magnetic stylus it'll stick to the edge of the device uh and then on the back
they have a conversion feature which i'll show a little bit later so up here you got the zooming
uh so in just a different style like the pencil actually looks like a pencil writing
so here's kind of a look at a note if you don't have the greatest handwriting like i do
page just to see how it would hand handle like some sloppy writing some list items and some different symbols
you know it works pretty well some some things work better than others like the symbols
um it doesn't really recognize certain symbols but like these ones seem to work pretty well
so again it requires a markable remarkable account and you use the remarkable app to transfer your content
you can still use all of your writing functions and it has the highlighter as well
you know with a big screen like this and you've got a few options for your fonts
these devices are kind of nice for the pdfs but the remarkable doesn't have a whole lot of features
you know it'll get a little bit bogged down when you're loading like this multiple thumbnail view
there's little dials or you can choose from some preset zoom levels but the zoom levels aren't maintained
once you turn the page so once you turn the page it'll reset back to regular view
although it's not a big problem since the display is usually farther away because of that large screen
a reset button micro SD card slot and the 2 megapixel camera on the other end is the speaker
if that's not enough then you can store a microSD card and transfer some of your apps onto it
it's handy to have a place to keep it so it's a nice addition to the tablet
the monitor has five buttons that being the power button the menu button and navigation buttons
it was easy to put together as you were given an allen key and screws it took about five minutes
I have to download the driver in order for the pen and monitor to work with my computer downloading
this is where you can edit the pen pressure to your liking as well as what monitor the pencils apart
I can't alternate between the human monitor and my Wacom tablet as the drivers are incompatible
problem is the fact that the pen doesn't recognize the on-screen keyboard that you can use on
I'm so glad I was given the chance to use this and to continue to make art
i just love metal but anyway however simplistic the device forces an unostentatious median quartitian aesthetic
side of the tablet the volume and fingerprint sensor are located on the right side of the tablet
the device supports standard wi-fi gps bluetooth version 4.2 and surprisingly lg did go with 3.5
but the real downside to this trade-off is you will be paying well over 300 green stamps
at the end of the 24-month billing cycle fortunately there are cheaper and better options though
it's inexpensive and has a boatload of features first and foremost it's a 9.7 inch diagonal IPS
iris display you'll find on the iPad air it's powered by Intel's Z 37 36 F processor
this should be no surprise since we are an Android family friendly forum but I do have a surprise
this is a dual boot device so it also can boot into a full-blown installation of Windows
today it is a 3g tablet meaning it will connect to a cellular network it up to 3G speeds
you'll see a white plastic strip across the top folks since this is a solid aluminum
shell the entire back of this of this device is one big sheet of aluminum formed for the sides
put this plastic strip up here and all the antennas wcdma the GSM the Wi-Fi the Bluetooth and the GPS
you'll also see the rear facing camera which is 5 megapixel camera and then finally toward the bottom
it's impressed me with its ability to run non-stop for half a day in the box
which if you connect the two ends together this turns this cable into a micro USB to microUSB direct connect
so you could connect your your cell phone to it and I presume you would do either
get pretty dull as I turn this up and then as we hit one of these pictures well again
obviously it's overpowering the camera but what a beautiful display the photos that come up on
it's essentially a clone of the ipad air and again as i say i think it's absolutely a beautiful display
then you've got a volume down on a volume up and we've got another nice button here
it comes in at 12.5 inches by 16 point nine inches and has a width of two inches
I was able to get the screen relatively close to another monitor that I use primarily
there was a bit of a halo around some of the colors caused by the screen
I used to travel to keep my hand from catching on the glass and it was generally a nice experience
the pen is the only thing that has programmable buttons on it and in the driver
it goes for around $400 which is pretty much half the cost of the Proms smallest Cintiq but 13 HD
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here with a review of the Microsoft Surface RT tablet.
Running down the ports along the left side you’ll find a volume rocker and headphone jack
Speaking of specs the Surface RT is powered by a quad core Nvidia Tegra 3 processor clocked at 1.3
life is excellent with between 6 to 9 hours on a charge and a slim 9.4mm frame.
On the flip side you lose out on a lot of processing power: even the quad core
right up until your fingers get tired of the less than spectacular keyboard or smartphone internals.
and you end up with something that isn’t a great tablet and isn’t a great laptop.
It’s a respectable compromise that some people will love but for me I feel like it’s not quite there yet.
Once the app ecosystem gets fleshed out and Windows RT gets sorted the Surface could be spectacular

hey guys this is watch from the mw network and today we're doing a review for the toshiba thrive
it's actually rated at 0.63 inches making a little bit thicker than most of the tablets that are out there
the first button is the power and standby the one right next to it is the volume rocker
this tablet is really fully featured as you would expect from a modern day computing device
and make sure you're on top of applications that don't need to be running and the nice thing about android
it sometimes takes a little while to get the processor up to speed for what's happening in that flash video
you can buy the 8 gig which is under 400 and basically expand the memory up to 128 gigabytes
that would definitely improve a lot of those physical aspects of it another thing that should be improved for later
toshiba thrive against the hp touchpad and the ipad 2 in terms of making those direct comparisons
so make sure to subscribe and watch out for those videos in the very near future
hey guys so thank you so much for watching and if you have any questions about anything i talked about
uh there's some great there's always some great comments out there and we thank everyone of you
Bamboo capture tablet is definitely an improvement from the graph fire series that they had a few years ago
Bamboo capture tablet is compatible with both Mac and PC and as you can see you get Photoshop Elements
though the only places it is currently available right now is through welcome themselves for around forty four
and it has all the features you would want out of a higher-end tablet touch sensitivity is great now
if you have any questions please feel free to ask them but I definitely recommend getting
where you could pull it off and flip it around this one unfortunately is not as cool as that one
they tried to make it almost kind of like a surface a Microsoft Surface designed to some extent
it's got the same kind of kickstand kind of approach to things but it really isn't
this is an 800 megahertz part about the same as you would see an other core
but that's not gonna be very practical on an airplane or something where your seating is very limited now
there are some ports of note on here though you've got a video out with an HDMI micro adapter there
which might be helpful because you only have 128 gigs of storage on the main device
and we can scroll through everything we can even get the ads popping up very quickly as well
I will go over to a YouTube page real quick and just see some videos on there
I can move the images around if I wish I'm probably gonna screw up the document in the process there
this doesn't really perform the two tasks it sets out to do very well this is LAN Simon
now if you've seen any of the ads or if you know anything about this it's basically a gaming tablet
and all the rest of the hardware is geared towards showcasing that new k1 chip in fact
that's really what this whole tablet is all about so nothing too flashy going on with the design
I opened it up here on the shield tablet and the k1 handled it like a boss
it's kind of kind of what you look for when you're buying a tablet and this basically nails it now
I guess Nvidia just made this for this new device and it uses and recognizes the shape of the stylus
my car has an aftermarket cat header and I'm running the stage to tune and with that combination
ECU tech license and the other $300 is just for their tune so at five hundred dollars
you're already saving one hundred and seventy five bucks off of a tune from say delicious
title is just rock-solid and another thing is that this tune it completely eliminates the loud cold start
you wouldn't want it to look and feel like the way this looks in the fields
I have a lot of things to say about the open flash manager none of which are positive so
it'll read your ECU you'll get a tune it's identical and the reason that I say I would not buy
I read every single comment and I try to respond to every single one as well other than that
hello everyone it's me again with another tablet review because you can never have too many tablets today
it has a 10 by 6 and a quarter inch work area 12 shortcut keys and 16 soft keys
you can plug this bad boy into your phone and draw on there if you want
they're also doing a promotional activity right now that allows you to get some free accessories with your purchase
i usually work with 24 frames per second and i also use krita to animate so
i'm including this as a step because it's generally not a good idea to just jump right into animating something
it could also be smart to make some color keys of what colors you want everything to be
which parts of your animations are super smooth and which parts might not need the extra attention after
you've gotten it to a point you're satisfied with the next step is up to you
you can either clean up the sketches you just made or you can skip straight to the line art
i don't usually clean up the sketch because it saves time which is a really good thing
i wasn't sure what to expect from the soft keys because i've never used those before
i've been using this tablet for about two or three weeks now and i haven't run into any problems yet
i also tried it out with an android phone as you already saw and it worked pretty okay
i still prefer it on my laptop though since the scaling is a bit easier compared to a tiny phone
there's all sorts of other animation tutorials here on youtube and i highly recommend watching some other ones
hi guys and welcome to lee's tech room and today's video is all about a nice little graphics tablet
i don't think that's a great idea but you can change the rotation of it as well
if you're doing it you can do it on your mobile phone as well which is brilliant
click which is quite handy so if i press that uh it's not gonna work there
we double click on here and then we can change it to whatever we want you can control
yeah you must be able to tell who it is now so now we'll get the what we're doing
AC adapter the power brick and the cable itself which is nice because it's a Type C cable
we've got two speakers stereo speakers and then we've got the memory card slot on the left the type
PowerPoint Excel and as you can see considering the price of the device everything works pretty well fully supports everything
it's pretty easy to edit these documents or or use it for media consumption yeah overall
I only just last fall tried out my first Amazon Fire HD tablet the Fire HD 8 and
I've been fortunate enough to be able to test out the Amazon Fire HD 10 during some downtime recently
Canada calm to see the exact comparisons if you want but I'm going to sum it up here for you
it's obviously not nearly as fast as something like the iPad pro when I reviewed the Fire HD 8
I wouldn't say they're ultra high quality because in something this size that's just realistically not possible
like what you'd see on the saint's a Bosch was a bit of a challenge overall
this tablet is loaded with apps and productivity tools too as a web browser called silk email
I found many of the daily apps I use on my iPhone are also available in Amazon's app store
the folks at artists all sent me their latest drawing tablet the d13 to try out and I'm impressed
so the v13 is a 13 inch drawing tablet it compares very closely to the 13-inch
Cintiq it pretty much has the same specs as the Cintiq it smells like a Cintiq
D 13 sells for 599 dollars whereas the entry-level Cintiq sells for $200 more 799 now
it looks like what their goal is is to become a real way come competitor not just a knockoff
so this isn't going to be a direct apples-to-apples comparison but I think it gives me a pretty good idea
I've got used to drawing on devices like the surface that don't have any tactile buttons to press
but that's going to cost you a thousand dollars instead of the $7.99 lower end version
so really what we're talking about is for $400 less you're missing a feature the only real touchscreen command that
the last few years is jitter on the strokes as you can see from these drawing examples
I also tried to plug it into my surface pro to see if it would work
I only encounter one real problem while using the tablet early on when I was playing with it
so there's almost like no difference between where you're drawing in the glass on this monitor
I noticed because I've used the iPad pro on the surface a lot so to wrap it all up
I don't think you're really sacrificing much of anything this thing is just as good as anyway come
I'm going to leave a link down in the description that takes you to the Amazon page
i don't know how it's pronounced and gonna figure that out in the next two weeks
it's got like a rubberized finish but like quite satin as well very satisfying to hold very comfortable
some extra controls here as well including the power button and then on the actual front of the tablet
you're using so very user friendly and really nice that we've got six express keys in total now mention
uh that is not uh on a display just uh just to interact with your computer display
I'm here today to talk about this tablet small cheap a compact little hue on each 420
Express gates on the side allowing you to set them to the erase tool zoom in zoom out keys
though which is something you must install to use this for art otherwise you want to pin pressure and you
it has rather high specs for such a simple little thing but how does it actually perform
I tried it once on Windows 7 and no matter how much I tried no matter what I did
I tried it later on Windows 10 and it worked flawlessly similar to how the Mac handles it
I don't have cramps while drawing but with this tablet it definitely caused quite a few
thanks to a battery inside of it but the shape is still a bit uncomfortable to me
the tablet even has any pressure at all causing an error to show up in the brush panel well
it's something that if you have the right setup you can get used to it would
I have to find one while planning in this video it's called the XP pen G 430
we're thinking about making the purchase plunge to get some digital art going and get a tablet anyways
we got a brand new tablet company releasing next week or this week by the time
everything from this point forward is my honest opinion and i can tell you i am blown away
this is the first tablet company that i really really think can give wacom a run for their money
um all the other tablet companies even though they have grown greatly over the past few years
we get a nice pen case to carry around our stylus on and this has two different pen
as far as drivers goes these guys are probably the best supportive for all different platforms mac linux and windows
i do want to talk about a few final thoughts that i have on this thing
they're killing it because if this is their first go on a professional grade tablet from them
wacom is coming out with right now as far as these types of tablets so again sense labs
running would be the best way as a demonstration so check out the timestamps for some of the different apps
we'll move on to what that actually means with my practical tests kicking off with a broadband speed test
but the upload speed did max out at the limit of my broadband connection for reference
dropping it down to 120 hertz and we're hitting 120 fps a lot of the time as the race program
sound from the speaker is not amazing but it is good enough and certainly loud enough
they've tried to get the max out of the technology available today at the lowest possible price
and it's only two days until the opening of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in Spain
they have already told us that they gonna reveal their new flagship throws tomorrow day before they were
IV in berlin so will they announced a new flagship phone that said six possibly not
I have an idea about that but we'll have to wait and see what they say on Monday
let's start by taking a look at the design of the Sony Xperia set for tablets
it is a kind of nice feeling to the plastic that a velvety kind of surface
you have a microphone jack up here you also have a flap which i will try to open
there's a this protective thing here because this tablet is like most Sony Xperia stuff rated ip68
you can submerge it and have it in a sandstorm or something on the other side right here
USB charging port right there standard charging port no docking on this tablet on the bottom side
but there you go and on the left-hand side you have the power button and then just underneath power button
and since this is a sony xperia device it also supports the sony noise cancelling headphone technology
the rear facing camera is simple 8 megapixel thing and you shouldn't really take photos with your tablet anyway
in fact i think she did in one other video so you can check that out but to me
I have no idea where is where I am so I'm just going to run away
I will cut those films in as well another game that I really like at the moment is Lara
but this really isn't a very demanding game you can play that pretty much on anything
I don't really know what I'm doing possibly I could know what I'm doing and here
is that it kind of shows in my opinion what you can do on a tablet and
I really like these kinds of games and I would like to see more of them
the storage is a bit limited on this tablet because i bought the cheapest one so having installed
because i don't play them but i will show you those in a different clip into my mind
possibly but it's kind of shave you know fractions of a millimeter or something like that off
I've been told it it isn't actually working very well as the fingerprint sensor so that try
they tried to do the 5.5 inch 4k display and no one was really impressed with that
I think the reason for this is that there is no real software incentive to get the new hardware
we don't see money medic games or apps that use the extra ram we don't see anything in
Android that would go make it use of the ram for multitasking or anything like that
sorry google play store unless you have at least three gigs of ram in your device
know get out early and mud there currently is for more developers to release games like that
US dollars for a new phone when my own phone is still working perfectly and doing the job
you don't have a flash package nothing to go along with it you have a 3.5 mm headphone jack
what the physical tablet is capable of because a tablet is a tablet is a tablet
anyways we're going to just go through the Nook stuff we're not going to go through
all it does is trigger a redirect which means it opens up your web browser see
we just set this up so so we're not going to look at page speed because come on guys
in that regard you can also press and hold make highlights press and hold and make notes
we're going to make a note just to show you the speed of the typing oops
it'll be look home so this is where your library will be your Barnes & Noble readouts
so you can go to books you can go to the magazine store specifically romance teens kids and comics
if you want to choose your likes and dislikes you also have various amount of settings on the side
nuke shop will be all of your bestsellers your books your magazines and any of your desired categories
Nuuk library because we are going to read People magazine and this is just a preview magazine
yeah and that will give you a dual page spread table of contents which is really cool
I've noticed that say the nuke HD plus the 9.7 sucker the one really big back in the day
I mean it does get the job done and the magazine experience is quite nice on Barnes & Noble
tablets haven't really pushed themselves since say 2013 2014 when like the Google Nexus 7 came out
and all your latest apps and latest games and there's no lag and everything smooth so
I like the nuke line of tablets but no color the nuke tablets and no cage DD HD
wanted this tablet to be rather portable and compact so it's pretty thin it's not even 13 millimeters thick anyway
dial that you can customize it comes sweet a matte screen protector or anti-glare film already installed on the tablet
it's a very simple stand and it works very simply but it's a little difficult to change the angle
why the tablet is on the stand because in order to change the inclination of the tablet
there are no screw holes so even if you want to install one of those permanent stand
but you know the concept of this tablet is portability so I I can accept that
and because of the portability concept the tablet comes with a pouch and it looks very good
I find it so handy and comfortable to use the screen on this tablet is laminated which basically means that
it has improved a lot over time and because of the illumination is not very noticeable
I only know that by default this comes in the worm color profile setup and I changed it to srgb
anyway because this has an IPS full HD screen with an idiot % NTSC color gamut
I like the other stand better but I like to stab lit more because it's laminated it's more precise
I also prefer this design because it looks more and the other one when it comes to the portability thing
wherever in the world you are take care of yourself and the people around you and bye-bye guys
in our last episode we gave the BRZ some more grip with a sticky set of Zini
it used to be a real buzzkill accelerating out of corners with that dip in the power
also ethanol isn't as widely available in all areas here in Metro Detroit stations are pretty plentiful around us
POV test drive footage in the coming weeks of our BRZ on the e85 and stage 1 tunes
there's a lot of room for improvement as you can probably tell we've been really enjoying our winding road
the car is really well balanced with a level of power and grip that it has project
so it's a business spec laptop so if you need to it can be joined to a domain
I don't usually bother with that so again if we open up Microsoft Word the keyboard
now you have to use the on-screen keyboard which is quite easy to use you have the option to rotate
Wacom have been producing these graphics tablets for a long time now and this is their latest version
you've got this little grip area on the side here where you can slide your pen in there
so that's nice and handy for keeping the pen in a secure place all the times
and as well as the active area here for controlling your cursor on the screen you also get four
how you can configure the tablet and then how it actually works so first of all
for right hand juice with my Express keys on the left hand side here and they're not going to
I'm going to actually use the pen now the Wacom Bamboo fun does actually support pressure sensitivity so when
I can actually press lightly to get a thin line or increase the pressure to get a thick line now
which in itself is a redesign of the old version and this is the perfect redesign which
Mon PD 1560 screen tablet this is the first time I've ever used a screen tablet in my life
it made sense because he's working with fire and having long hair near fire is not really a good idea
I decided to turn his gloves into heat-resistant gloves like how firefighters or fry cooks use
sometimes that's necessary when you have to design a character after coloring the patterns on his body
this is definitely a major upgrade from the original design here are my final thoughts on the ghoul
I also really like how this doubles as a second monitor it makes it very easy to stream
I actually did stream with this not too long ago and I had no problems with it
let me turn this over here and you can see on the back here that you know
Cintiq which again we're talking a $399 unit versus an $800 unit and you can see this is metal
I don't think it's a loss not for the price now hooking up the Wacom one is very very simple
this actually they do include an AC adapter but I love this because these smaller tablets
I just plug it in like that and I'm good to go very easy to connect
put some weight on this and it's it's not gonna budge but look at the performance
you know it's now talk about the tech specs here in a minute or two but sensitivity is great like
I'll show you some of the drawings that we did and pinky boo is gonna be doing some drawing too
this is actually her first time ever using a tablet so this should be pretty interesting
she's actually it's the first time she's used a digital art tablet and this is a good tablet for
yeah it does but I'm just like not used to it because my pencils are very pigmented
oh well the nice thing about this though is you can actually work in layers so you can draw it
I don't know why it just I'm so bad then like I'm not gonna that's why you'll see is actually
I drew this 100% on the wacom one tablet that I used to draw a Disney comics professionally
I've actually drawn the new version of Uncle Scrooge from ducktales so you know we'll see how I do anyway
it doesn't feel cheap in fact it feels sturdier than some of the more expensive off-brand tablets
I just hook it in the laptop and I'm ready to go um it's a great unit for students
I had a chance to hang on to it for a couple of weeks and this is what I found
I'm in the middle of watching Bosch on prime video and it hooked me up with the last episode
but where it had one gig of ram before it's now about one and a half things like battery
I cranked it up to full but even then I thought it could have used a bit more brightness power
I'm going to switch over now and show you a little about the camera on the Fire HD
this is an amazing feature to have and is sure to come in handy for you to capture some memories
to connect to a PC or Macintosh computer or to charge your device with the included power
it takes about six hours using the included micro USB power adapter here to charge the Amazon Fire HD eight
I used it on and off over about two weeks and really only had to charge it twice
I've really come to rely on Alexa most of all when it comes to smart digital assistants
sadly the Canadian version doesn't come with it and you can't find it on the Canadian App Store either now
I'm not sure if that's an Amazon issue or an audible issue but it is also mildly disappointing
now while we're on the subject of things the tablet can't do yet show mode also doesn't work in
the tablet doesn't do yet is video calling for video calling to work on this device you need
so all these fun and helpful features can finally be taken advantage of here in Canada overall
well this tablet definitely doesn't have some of the capabilities of something like an iPad pro
please hit that like button and consider subscribing since it does help me keep making more videos that
were kind enough to send me this graphics tablet here it's got a small graphics tablet but it's quite cheap
they're very similar to the Huey on the ug the XP pen and gammon and other brands are out there
generally speaking if you go for one of those sort of five brands you're absolutely fine
the drivers they're updated regularly and they should be fine to work with most of your systems
I did actually have to go back and reinstall my Wacom drivers after I'd use this though
it seems to work straight away the one thing I couldn't test was the pressure sensitivity
it's much the same as any other 8,000 levels of pressure sensitivity and it's got a resolution of 5080
but maybe you like that sort of thing but in terms of price this is fantastic
what's up everyone mark here with promivo tv and i'm sitting down today to review the little tablet
you're gonna be very impressed if i had to give the display a bad mark here at all
something that overall i think people will probably scoff at but here we are once again impressing me
today i got 12 hours out of this device 12 out of a tiny little tablet again
so of course i went to see if others in earlier reviews this year and experienced this
separate uh detachable and it does offer a surprising amount of key travel for what is again a detachable accessory
that my co-producer and i just keep joking that they shouldn't have even put it on the keyboard
you know it just clicks and locks into place super easy here well now that i'm trying to freehand it
not uh the back case and the kickstand here that's also magnetic and sticks to the back
i think they did a really really great job of that and i think overall the one thing
uh yeah there's just a usbc port on here for charging data transfer and so on
i think we're all a little bit surprised that this came out so great so seriously
and if you're looking for something in this budget end i can't recommend this enough okay
it says window on the back end of the tablet but it's actually got android on it as well
it says total space 3.8 seven gigabytes as opposed to what if it was 29 in
Windows 10 again on the power dialog here we've got boot to Windows so simply touch
you've got things like the Microsoft edge here as you can see it boots through quite quickly
just drag it from the top like so in a way it goes what we got down here
I believe it's got USB 3 in the side here yes you have USB 3 just here we've got HDMI
USB charger that you've got kicking about that will do it as well when I first received this
I had to use this multi port USB adapter thing here in one of the ports
you won't see it on any because it's not plugged in but you had to file it by that
I think you can also tap focus it we also got video video available to us
Windows apps on here as well guys the same ones you got in the computer you can
was we better check their website out so it will actually run like your ordinary desktop computer
so you've got a choice you can either use it by touch like this here or as
actually it runs quite quickly as I say you can run ordinary Windows programs with it
you can also share the review with your friends and don't forget to click like if you enjoyed it too
thanks for watching and I will catch you here again at Rathbone Manor in the very near future then
I tried to get back to everyone but sometimes a your queries and questions do actually slip by me
let me just unlock it all right so we're unlocked you've got all the usual things before
so if you're if you're going to be putting things onto the SD card or anything like that
that time 63 okay right and then you batch you screen so TF card slot this way set expandable
you've got a 1024 by 600 pixels screen and one gig of ram eight gig hard drive
megapixel and the rear is 2 megapixels or not the best but it is for children great schüttler
it comes with a little card and then the tablet which i'm about to see it's exciting okay
the tablet comes with eight preset hard keys but you could always change what the keys stand for
i couldn't do the homework simon so i ended up just taking it out and just using my track
it just takes some practice and you'll feel more natural using the tablet after a while
but don't just throw your tablet away and get mad and cry that it didn't work right away
it is a great size it is very cheap and it works on multiple softwares like photoshop
OSM VTX recovering watching her video review of the Lipan TC 970 Android 2.2 Froyo based Android tablet
5 new 12 megabytes of RAM 2 gigabytes of ROM upgradeable via a microSD card slot
I'm taking a closer look at the tablet itself again is extremely reflective but otherwise it's a very well-constructed device
I can scratch a little bit more easier and attracts a little more smudges than usual
the top houses the reset hole along with the power on and off switch which is extremely small and recessed
it as far as design is considered there's also a lanyard strap on the right-hand side of the tablet itself
the main thing you'll notice about the screen is also the fact it has a 178 degree
some other aspects to take note of is the fact again that the webcam here actually has a 720p
RAM installed you have to install a separate SD card before you can actually use the camera application
HD resolution videos which are very cool and they are very sharp and easy to read as well so overall
Maps works pretty well as far as customer support is considered love hand didn't provide too many updates
Android 2.2 however one aspect where the pen did upgrade is the Android Marketplace to the Play
reading ebooks is another area where the device will excel at some other things to take note of
the search functionality worked pretty well and there wasn't any really huge issues we had and let's try that again
PC if you want to learn more about the Lipan TC 970 producer a full review here os VTX recom
it has an unnamed 1.3 gigahertz quad-core processor 2 gigs of RAM 16 gigs of internal storage an SD card
you have the home and the back but there's actually the Walmart logo on the bottom right there
and other things you can also check nearby stores and prices by putting in your zip code
currently all of the geolocation stuff the shopping the grocery everything else is based on the US
it's more wholesale based and you can add things to your cart here all the same
you're not kind of like locked out to purchases that you've already made but you can see
then we can just sort of isolate ebooks and you have dedicated section here for emerging prizewinners which is
there's worse things in the world that you can spend sixty four dollars on you could be a
Fein like me and spend that on microtransactions on games or you can invest in this Walmart tablet
I feel that with Google Play in conjunction with all the Walmart core apps and Android 9.0
I mean you're not with bleeding edge specs here but two gigs of ram quad core processor
you're not gonna get like a 2k or 4k experience you know watching like you know
Amazon Prime video and things like that but this is a great low cost tablet that is powerful
well there's not a lot of leg and stuttering when you do things there's not a noticeable just you know
I chose a sketch that is pretty detailed because I don't want to just draw something really quick and easy
they're so easy to customize they make a great starting point for whatever you want to create
what we have is a nice little thank-you card from hooey on saying thank you for buying this particular product
which is the actual area that you're drawing in is 4 inches wide and about 2.2 inches deep
is this particular tablet since it's the low-end tablet only has 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity
a lot of the new stuff that's coming out has way more than that has like 8000 levels of pressure
and if you just look at those numbers you might think wow is that enough but I can
I remember when the original surface pro 3 came out and had the pen with it
I opened it and then I sat around like a huge derp for the next few months
a two fingered drawing glove one of the coolest cables of all the cables a super-sweet pen holder which
the tablet has 10 programmable buttons which depending on what program you use negates the need for a keyboard
the stand that it comes with can adjust from nearly flat to just about 90 degrees
this tablet is capable of creating so much better art than I am capable of making
I'll leave a few links in the description to speed arts that other better superior artists have done
it's large enough to be professional while small and cheap enough to not take over your desk or your finances
Gama media I'm grant Abbott and today I'm looking at the XP pen Decco Pro medium
maybe it's even better than drawing on paper in some weird way but it was very fluid
you've got middle and you can move around the middle and program different things for that
let's say zooming in and out and this one can be a brush size and it's very nice
there was no sort of weird occasionally with the the much cheaper tablets around 30 pounds
I haven't used a modern Wacom recently obviously I've used display where cons like their mobile studio
it has an anti glare screen and you can adjust the stand between 15 and 85 degrees
tablet of this size does seem like very good value so again very interested to see how it performed
get a little fabric sleeve that you can use to store the pen you get the pen itself
and then they also came with the tool itself to replace them as well and there was an HDMI cable
I always do a quick comparison between my Wacom pen and other tablet pens just to show the difference
stand the spare nibs that came with this tablet are all the same whereas with some tablet companies
I didn't actually film it but it was simple enough to replace also in the box you get
I did try the graph that came with the tablet but because I have Hobbit hands
we're out here and I know we're in the minority but just kind of adjusting your products to encompass
that mine is too old and doesn't have an HDMI port but it was so slow
I'm using this tablet with a seven-year-old Dell Latitude East 6-4 100 with Windows 7 64 bit
I use this laptop consistently for all my tablet reviews because my main computer has hooked up to my Cintiq
I'm not sure why it just needed a couple of restarts to kind of get it going
already attached to it and there isn't any mention of it in the instruction manual so
it wasn't too smooth like the glossy surface of an iPad which is something that I struggle with
I did notice some parallax however other reviews I've seen from first-time screen tablet users trying out
so this may be me talking from the perspective of someone used to absolutely zero parallax and from the little
I played with pressure settings to try out different variations and see how far I could vary the line width
lines to experiment with how smoothly I could make them and I was pleased with the result
I personally prefer more variety in the type of nib available since I usually go for felt nibs
if you're looking for your first screen tablet I would say this would make a solid choice
please let me know in the comments if there's anything you'd like to know and thank you to
I'm going to be doing a review and demonstration of the XP pen artist 15.6 IPS graphics
the screen has several layers of plastic packaging and a screen protector on it for the filming of this video
and lightweight it feels really comfortable in the hand and it's actually a very similar size to a regular pen
which is recommended you do as it can often fix any bugs or performance issues so
I only had one issue which I fixed quite easily and I'll talk about that in a moment
it's not too small but I feel cramped when I'm working and it also fits really nicely on my desk
many of these types of drawing screens come with stands that attach to the back of the tablet
so it's by no means as portable as a regular iPad or that kind of tablet
it's a second screen for your PC or laptop but it is quite light and it could be portable
and that's a big plus in my book because I never remember to charge my digital pens
Swiss swiftly across the screen and then the cursor or the brush on the PC followed quickly as well
let me know if you have any questions in the comments down below and I will see you next time
it comes in pink color green and blue so whichever color your kids like and in the back
if you like this video please like subscribe share and hit the notification button whenever we post a video bye
my commonly used shortcuts like the bigger brush smaller brush color picker and undo and redo buttons
this is an excellent tablet especially for the price and I'll continue to use it when I'm working in Photoshop
the resolution is 5000 80 lines per inch the report rate is 228 revolutions per second
I have right there but then there is one problem on the pen that I just really really hated
hundred is a weird day and there you have it the review for the XP pengie 430 gaming tablet
there's a lot of tablets like this out there like a three on 420 and new
has this mechanism that you can put it at any like degree that you want that
it is huge it has 1080 resolution in the area is 13.5 by seven point six inches
you just line up the holes on the stand with the holes on the tablet and screw it in
I'm not handy with tools so it was easy for me and for the bottom two
I plugged those these two in on to my tablet these two in to my computer
now when you first get a tablet it's kind of hard just like a normal tablet
I haven't had a lot of time to work on it so I'm still working on it
I only have a couple of things on there and you can check it out if you want
you don't have to like it but if you like it like it well you'll stop anyway
I hope to see from you guys later because I know you want to see from me later
it's more comfortable smart device for those who need a wide screen for studies and entertainment
heavy it's made of sturdy and high quality polycarbonate so it's going to last for a long time
we find the power button volume rockers and mic turning to the left we find the speaker
i ran some benchmark test on this tablet and here are the scores as i said before the alcatel 1t10
the alcatel 1 t10 smart tablet is fitted with a 2 megapixel back camera and a 2 megapixel front camera
it will give a responsible amount of battery life like about a day's charge which is sufficient in my view
do put down your thoughts in the comment section below and do like share and subscribe to the channel
i will meet you in the next one until then this is manish signing off you
Tab s for about 20 days now and the striking thing about this tablet is its display
it has a 8 core processor 3 gigs of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage
Tab s 10.5 as you've seen from the review the display is the highlighting factor of this tablet but again
I felt that the volume was not that great also in the UI it uses the Samsung magazine
UI and though it is pretty responsive but at times notice a little bit of stuttering here and there
that's a little bit of a corn and coming to the last night is in India
Samsung is just selling this 3G and Wi-Fi variant they are not selling the Wi-Fi only variant
thank you for watching this video this is Ranjit and I hope to see you in my next video you
Pro the price for this at the time of this review is us 15 $9.99 on amazon.com
the whole pen is made of plastic so it feels a bit hollow but it's well built
it's matte it's nice a hole that's the nib and the design is very simple at the back here
we have this home but this hand is not how about battery so you don't have to charge it
and there's a grid dot texture which you may not see the dry surface it's matte
I like that you can control the pressure curve manually like this instead of using the slider
I'm going to leave this as default and if you're left-handed you can choose this option here
that's the button in the middle of the wheel so that button allows you to switch between different functionality
I just want you guys to see the line quality so the line quality is quite good
slow lines don't have much jitter this by the way it's now assuming that 400% and yes it's very smooth
I just clicked that and now I can see the zoom it works and now I click it again
that's the problem here another problem that I discovered with the Mac OS driver is CDs pressure sensitivity curve
Windows if you are a Mac OS user with the current driver version 2.0 point 0.6
The tablet with 6.5 x 4 inches of active drawing area, 4 shortcut buttons, and nonslip pads on the back.
Manual. To use the tablet on your Android device, first make sure you are running Android 6.0 or higher.
Pick the adaptor end that fits your device, plug that to the other end of the cable.
On some devices, you will need to go to settings and enable OTG for the tablet to work.
Important note: you cannot use the tablet’s shortcut buttons or the pen’s shortcut buttons when plugged into an Android device.
Your tablet settings show up in two places: on the desktop and in the icon tray.
On the bottom of this window, if you have problems in any program, try disabling or enabling Windows Ink.
Huion tablets will not work the way you expect in internet browsers like Chrome unless you disable Windows Ink.
Normally when you hover a pen over the tablet, the cursor appears at the same place on your computer.
In the third tab you can customize what area the tablet uses to represent your screen.
lets you export and import your settings, which you may do if you have different settings for different programs.
I tried drawing with my finger on my phone and it was impossible compared to drawing with the tablet.
On a computer you’ll easily see nice, controlled strokes, but phone drawing is much less fine tuned.
The small drawing area meant I didn’t have as much control as I would with a bigger tablet.
For somebody who wants to try out digital art without spending $70, the HS64 is a good choice.
For more drawing tablet reviews, look below or go to scribblekibble.com, click episodes, and then the product reviews button.
for Samsung the top-of-the-line models like Pino Pro and Tam pro series hasn't been updated in over a year
but if you need a tablet and don't want to wait for the best of the best
A now I personally paid two hundred and twenty nine dollars at the time this video
I'm Jimmy wood Jim's review room comm and I'm here to help you make a purchase decision
the entire unit is made of plastic but being so thin and built with a smooth texture
next by now to the left of that is one speaker that serves its purpose here for music
that's unedited and you can be the judge if this looks good to you or not
in addition last year's tab for tablets had a higher resolution and a 16 by 10 wide aspect ratio
let's say or those who have a decent tan on screen will look a bit reddish or yellow
now only one and a half gigs of RAM is on board again and 16 gigabytes of internal memory
now keep in mind you can still have the you still have the microSD card slot to use
Lite to general web surfing it runs fine from my experience and most games of the App
despite not being the best the best this can handle the generic wants it to load it up
web pages needs to be refreshed often and the entire tablet starts still bogged down a little bit again
unfortunately it has similar specs as the tab for from last year but goes down on the resolution
A when it is not on sale if it's on sale you're shelling out an additional $30 or so so
i didn't always want to talk to the computer and i also often just forgot the commands
i always forget about onto the tablet screen and allows you to push and swipe your way around
well if we take a look at asphalt 8 you can see it runs really well
so you tilt it left and right to control the car and it was really good fun
i got lost in this for quite a while racing around the track one thing i will say though
i made this list based on performance features price and more i've included options for every type of consumer
although some third-party apps like facebook can be sluggish but not to the extent to be deal breakers
1280x800 resolution is responsive and delivers some nice colors for watching videos and streaming shows battery
you'll find it's fine for video chats as long as you have decent lighting built-in alexa
tv shows and play games together making it an ideal entertainment device for home or on the go
so you can be assured they only have access to child safe content plus the built-in eye care
you'll get about seven hours of video playback which may be the only weak point of this tablet
samsung will be a better option for you if you need more expandable storage than that
tab s6 lite coming up later in the video with expandable storage up to one terabyte
you'll get about 13 hours of mix use 5 megapixel front facing and 8 megapixel rear cameras
if you're looking for an affordable ipad the latest 8th gen ipad features an upgraded processor
that now gives you the biggest bang for the buck when it comes to apple's ipad lineup
it's actually quite a capable productivity device you'll find with support for apple's smart keyboard and ipad os 14
currently priced at 345 the galaxy tab s6 lite is a toned down version of samsung's previous flagship model
it may not have all the bells and whistles but it's still feature-rich and the aluminum build with small bezels
unlock your tab with samsung's face unlock although it can be a little unreliable when it comes to consistency
extend me this tablet for a review but all thoughts and opinions will be my own
Helion pen is a rechargeable pen and it needs to be charged for most other tablets
I would highly recommend it for beginning artists that are wanting to get into digital art
this particular model doesn't have microSD expansion but other models do give you that option in terms of display
SIM this would have had microSD here as well headphone the charging micro USB at the top
I think it's actually quite good value if you want to use this tablet for as
I say drawing artistic drawing and creative faults if on the other hand you want to take notes
I'll show you a demonstration in a second so in regards to just using it as a standard
let's just see if this works as you can see as we're writing on the paper version it copies what
on the z4 tablet has higher resolution higher maximum brightness and better contrast over all the bezels
you have to take some things out in other places so it has an MT 8165 processor
but when you get into some of the higher-end 3d stuff that will struggle on here but again
I think if you're watching video doing Netflix and YouTube and other things on here I will do quite well
it's certainly playable may not be as smooth as it is on something that costs more or something
maybe play a game every once in awhile and doesn't want to spend more than 250 dollars
I know I wasn't always there for you that's why I've made some changes to my life
they also offered a free tablet in order to review it so here we are again and once again
I'll be doing a redesign to test it out like I said in the last one
the pen doesn't need to be charged and it comes with a cleaning cloth for your screen
I mean it does make a little bit of sense especially with the current canon of S&T
I started drawing the gloves shirt and skirt normally and then I added and changed things to my liking
I inverted the shades of blue on our shoes and I really liked how that looked so I kept it
I even added a darker darker shade of blue into the mix to make it more dynamic
it made me feel really good now for my final thoughts on the Huey on canvas
that feels very nice to draw on and the colors look really good on it and once
I'll definitely be buying a stand for it though what should I do with this extra tablet though
i've reviewed one of their tablets before the pd 1161 and now i'm going to be reviewing the gaomon s620
so if you are a beginner and you want a drawing tablet keep on watching okay
then you can see the tablet itself and a little compartment right beside it on the left side
you can see the pen it's battery free and you don't have to charge it which is very convenient
the cable were supposed to connect your tablet to your computer or your android smartphone or tablet
and if you will actually connect it to your android device there are these adapters you can use
after the tablet you can also see a bunch of things the nibs and the nib remover
of course i needed a driver so i went to their website searched up the driver
then i went on to setting things up before i actually say my thoughts about this tablet
the pen was pretty responsive the pressure sensitivity was working well and despite its size i got comfortable with it
this review will cover the use of this tablet on Mac OS and also on Windows
this tablet is just top-notch now the main highlight of this header is the wireless capability
this trackpad is quite similar to trackpads that you can find on laptops so it works the as well
they are always quite good and this habit here is rated for 40 hours and only stop use and
there are no lines so that happened to me quite a lot but in today's demonstration
let me switch over to Adobe Illustrator let me create a new file so with illustrator
it looks as well let me try and pick a brush that has variation in terms of the thickness
so let me pick up this brush and it works very nicely with this caching app
it doesn't work as well so when I'm using MIDI Bank on the iPad when I do this gesture
I'm going to give up and now I'm going to pinch to zoom and zoom out
it will create dots instead of lines but introduce demonstration it work fine with MIDI Bank pin
yes again can you see the changes in pressure even though I applied the same weight over
photoshop cs5 it crashes whenever I click on the tablet so photoshop cs5 on Windows 10
CC the pressure does not work MIDI bank paint pro 10.2 on windows works fine with mischeif 1.5 on windows
so that's an issue as well if you find out that it's a lot to take in
I was able to replicate some of those issues but this is just my personal experience with this specific model
and if you want to check out reviews for other tablets the link is in my video description below
so i think the tablet for that price and those specs that is just the sweet spot
it's a plastic back but it's sort of made to look like that sheeted metal effect which is quite nice
there's no real bloatware on the on the tablet either and i installed a few games
it's not very good and i don't think tablets are designed to have amazingly performed cameras anyway
this was the teclast p20 hd highly recommended budget device with great performance links in the description below
But I will be doing a much more in-depth feature I want to share a few of the small things
That have happened to me as I'm using this device and also how it frames itself as well
Really encourage you to get in the mindset of offline And try and work on this e-ink display
But actually helps to improve your writing and also get you a bit more focused now
But as you can imagine something to note on the quality However, aside from that the eating display looks lovely.
It touts a five to seven day battery life, but I've would say it's a little bit less an app
But the good thing about this is even though that three to five battery days life that I've experienced
Okay, so that was more about the hardware and let's talk a little bit about the software now.
what both work in the same way one is white one is black but as you can imagine
I want to start with the Wi-Fi You can connect to your home Wi-Fi or whatever.
Why find your on there's no 3G cellular connectivity However, it does limit you to what you can do.
But you could probably do with something else you already use like scannable or Evernote now
You can have these pre created week planners and a range of other ones as well
So you do get to start out both in portrait and landscape if you want to get started
So once you create a notebook there is a range of options down the left hand side
It's only gonna show one color and that is dark so you can do shades so you can do
Have an eraser and you can also move certain elements around you can zoom in zoom out
To other people in your team in a range of different formats so That's very handy
you can view stuff in lists or gallery view, but those are the only two options and one thing
I'm showing you so make sure you go to Settings and check that you've got an able update on
pretty instantaneously give you an example of the features, but in the bottom left hand corner
That one takes me away from the screen and allows me to make like for example
And the thing that I don't like as well is the pricing which I'll come to in a mode
So you're looking at the price of a basic iPad as you can imagine that is steep
Which means I probably have to review them are remarkable to and sort of give you my opinions on it
But again Apple tend to wrap on huge Prices for their pens or keyboards or accessories
Now the marker the basic mark you get is $59 so you can buy the pen
Then it makes when you utilize it, but that has no value at the same time
So that's gonna add on and the additional thing is if you want a folio with it
it's definitely aimed for those businessmen that want to switch off but take really attractive notes and email them
I really hoped you enjoyed this feature and I will talk to you all very very soon
nobody will ever know for nebs with an in remover and also the usual driver desk and user manual
this makes it so it doesn't skip any pixels or movements where you're playing the actual play field slash
I know most people have a gripe with and now this is all preference but I myself like the heaviness
don't understand why at least give me the option to turn it off and there is another weird thing
it is pretty lightweight needs to install but that's kind of where the good stuff ends
I don't really know what it is and I never got it to work at all
then i had an idea that included going to this bridge which was a whole hour long bike
ride away from my place but hey the bridge was aesthetic as so it's worth in the end
we also get to try out this brand spanking new tablet that was sent over from galman
a new drawing tablet on sale the pd2200 was such a nice tablet to animate on
they cool and all but i kept accidentally touching them whenever i grab the tablet on the side
and hey if you're interested in getting a tablet and this is still way over your price range
i just used to make this intro so subscribe and stay tuned for giveaway details coming later this week
it also serve every bright screen with 500 nits and it is brighter than every other 8 inch head that
it does feel very high-end however it does not look very high-end because it has the same with iPad
it still has a lightning connector but it also still has the headphone jack which is a positive thing
and the files up of course the iPad Mini 5 is the best 8 inch tablet
and even though it's a bit older it is still the fastest 8 inch android tablet
it has a very pretty 8.4 inch IPS screen with a very high resolution of 2560 by 1600 pixels
they are a bit older so I would strongly suggest you to check out the iPad Mini 5
yeah this is really one of my favorite 8 inch tablets the S Pen works great but yes
that was only released in a couple of countries like India Thailand and so on just an 8 inch IPS
it feels quite nice but there's no fingerprint scanner unlike with the standard media pad m58 without C light
8 inch tablet you can get versions with an HD screen and with the full HD screen
it's much better than what surprised suggests it is running almost pure and what 9 is pretty much vanilla
it's an 8 inch and whatever but it's a low-end tablets it's similar to the Lenovo
certainly not a high-end gaming tablet it has 2 gigabytes of RAM and a 32 gigabyte internal storage
but it's fine and again you probably will get two updates the cheapest 8-inch tablet that
the Amazon Fire HD 8 has an 8 inch screen it's an IPS panel with 1280 by 800 pixels
so it does have an HD screen not a Full HD one inside once a 1.3 gigahertz MediaTek quad-core processor
so let's look at the tablet first so again this is pretty good size the largest tablet
I don't know I just so it's gonna be exciting to try something bigger for once
it's nice sleek so let's get into some of these other things so there's this which
you can really tell that there was a lot of care put to the product which is something
I really appreciated about wakeup and the hue on is that I could use them both interchangeably
the thing is that if this is your only tablet or you don't plan on switching between tablets
I honestly don't think I'll really be using my other ones now that I have this
the size is great and it comes with a lot of great extra stuff and it's a great price
in fact part of me is honestly expecting a ton of people to comment and say that they knew what
I don't know regardless I really loved analyzing this part of the books so I'm gonna share my thoughts anyways
Jay feathers fault but it was only a coping mechanism truth is Don Pelt is completely responsible for his desk
imagine your brother has been working extremely hard and has been looking very stressed worried and exhausted
of course this is a stretch but in the mind of someone who's just suffered intense emotional trauma
it's a good enough reason especially when the true suspect here if I can even say suspect is yourself
Tiger hurt Tony Pelt and Rowan CAW are not acting differently though they may be sad
that a lot of people don't understand her and how she always blamed herself for what happened to plant ale
she's such an intriguing and captivating character and I find it really sad that so many people hate her
I can completely understand what compelled her to do so and I feel great amounts of sympathy for her
I'll also have larger print sizes available for just a few days but enough about Don pelt
do you can check out the description to find the purchase link and a coupon code anyways
as far as design the n1 feels great and you can compare it to any tablet on the market
Glass 3 the screen looks great the IPS panel provides a consistent picture no matter which angle you use
at first glance colors can appear a bit dull to some after doing a few color tests online
Android the chip that provides the horsepower is the Intel 64-bit Atom processor z3580 2.3 gigahertz
it seems like a very capable chip the SOC integrates a power VR g60 430 GPU
the first screen your last 12 applications you've opened and the second screen is a list of all applications installed
launcher does the job as well and I like it for a tablet launcher but it is replaceable
you can find me on youtube and on google+ and this is android authority your source for all things
and it looks very similar to the bigger brother xp pen deco 01 version 2 right the same design
but you know the prices always change for the current prices you can check the links in description below
by the way i received the product free for an exchange of my honest review okay
let's do a quick unboxing first and then i will review guys xp pan deco mini 7w graphics tablet
there is a rubber grip here and as always there are two side buttons on the pen
adapter comes with a tablet by the way i couldn't use it with the usb receiver in android mode
now okay you need to use the tablet vertically in android mode and you can write it just like that
this is a hobby android device and you see the pointer is visible on the screen
it's not the slimmest one but it is slim it looks modern and the best part is guys
so it comes with a magnetic cover and also come with a detachable wireless keyboard first
it's not those very big time so if you can see here it have this plastic roof here
so if you're not even using this tablet you can use it for other device which
okay right let me take it up first and turn it around and then you do have your microphone here
I have already set this up so I'm gonna quickly show you what I need to do
even you add in they were not able to assess it until you approve the app itself
okay this is all the apps that I have put in and I have approve it
I put on the goal assistant for my kids and the map put in next week
because this is a ten-inch it's really good for watching so I sign on to my next fate
so just just be for you to be aware and that okay so let me go on to
and then let's go into the main screen again and they also have this pre-loaded WPS office so for this
it will very quickly pick up the IPS address and I will just print out from there
there's no how to spell but I have actually used a keyboard I haven't turned it on yet
let me skip intro baby so it's can see it's really nice with this 10 inch tablets beside homework
I mean if you don't want your kids to assess that you can take it off okay
Play Store download the apps that you want and then you come here to approve it
so they will block any website that contains improper content category and edit update 332 billion web page daily
okay so just get out of here you know here and then now we'll go into the main page itself
it's like a clock and as sundar settle on your calculator here which is quite nice
and so it's really a very nice setup that this is not only using their system this is using
huion launched this in three colors black purple and green and i received the black one to review.
it's trying to inspire you to create such epic artworks that other companies post your work on their packaging too.
the cloth is there to wipe the screen and a glove to protect the screen from the smudges
and if you already had a spare one then well let's just say it's still a spare one.
the usb port is for the pc to recognize the device and the third red usb
so this is where the extendable cable comes in handy and yeah there is no power adapter
but anyway make sure to suspend your usb saving options in the power plan settings on windows.
i have been spoiled by a 4k screen so full hd feels like feels a little congested to me
my pc but it didn't ask for a restart on the laptop but once when i opened the software
also, i mean it almost pushes me to go out and buy this one, there were also absolutely no problems
damn i really can't nitpick anything here when it comes to working on all these software with this tablet.
the tablet lies flat on the table and as there is no stand available right in the box for many
as you can see here there is a very slight variation which happens as your viewing angle changes.
so this is where the market of such tablets will keep on existing and will never cease.
i believe for most of the artists it will be an essential accessory to avoid that
or just make sure you add one whilst placing your order in the very first go.
Iles this is gonna be a review slash unboxing for the Vanco matrix pad s7 tablet
I do have it all set up but let's first check out what comes inside of this box
so it's not like you know 720p or 1080p but you can see the angles are freakin amazing on this
jacks are rare these days you also have a port to add additional storage up to 128 gigabyte micro
also if you're looking to consume such you know other stuff such as Netflix or Disney
Google do well so if you want to do video calls you definitely can with this tablet and it will
you're gonna get up to eight hours of mixed use also you do get 32 gigabytes of on-board storage
so at that point as a media device to do video chats to surf the web
it's not bad at all loading up this little thing here and there you go everything works
and if it's worth the money here we go so before we open the actual tablet here
we're going to have um the power block so it's the power supply for the computer
of course it is a computer after all it takes a couple minutes and then there you go
there's no dedicated video card so instead we have an integrated graphic card not the best
i will say that it's feels a little bit outdated you know you can clearly see
yeah it definitely would have been better with at least qhd in terms of the colors
there's no lag and there were like no dead pixels no dead spots or anything like that
in my case i set it to disabled because i use the keyboard for all my hotkeys
it's definitely not hot and certainly not uncomfortable and i don't have it on film here
i was quite impressed drawing a straight line in my case i had no issue whatsoever
i just wish there was a way to restart them like you can easily restart wacom
you have to ship your entire machine to get it repaired and so while it can be something
this is definitely something that you should keep in mind because then we can move on to the conclusion
maybe they had like a family computer but not one themselves and then they've looked at graphic tablets
i was thinking also maybe schools might like that doesn't take too much space simpler for the it guys
basically this sounds to me like convenience and simplicity at the cost of configurability and power overall
now of course the price now keeping in mind that this is a computer on top of being a pen
i hope it was helpful and uh well if it was you know what to do
I'm going to review the Pablo a 640 graphic drawing tablet this is a review unit provided by
Pablo the main selling point of this tablet is the price at the time of this review
feel quality feels quite solid now the dots on the drawing area they remind me of the
this is the back where four rubber feet and that's the USBC port for the cable that is provided
here it's flat otherwise it's cylindrical almost cylindrical except for this part which is bigger there are two side buttons
this pen is not powered by battery so no charging required other things included in the
that's a good size for all sorts of display the size difference between this and this is a bit significant
what this means is when you draw when you move a tiny bit on the tablet
it's a bit slippery but there is texture to it which makes it nice to draw on oops my Photoshop
for some reason it has problem running on my computer and because there are only four
the pen is very sensitive strokes they taper very nicely very gradually and the transition from thin to thick
very well here this pen it doesn't have to sensitivity so there's not going to be any tutor support
a lanyard strap two with a hole and also a battery slot plus any raise button
the only downside to this is you guys cannot save your actual work the only way
but that's not that much of a downfall as you guys will actually be seeing it
now this is the the cheaper hobbyist kind of version and it comes with two free creative software downloads
we have a brass keys and you can excite assign these buttons to be anything you want
start your new native experience painter essentials is going to be kind of a simple kind of version so
I'm gonna add that to my library and then I'm also gonna want this clip studio paint
I'm going to download that now and I'm going to download no so that is cool
okay so this is the preference pane for the tablet which is probably exactly the same as you get on
so it's just kind of goes smoothly across the screen high acceleration means as you get really really fast
you can enjoy all the wonders of that on your own so with the tablet here like
it's kind of everything that you're gonna need to go and of course you can look up on
that's better and we can choose colors down here and all sorts of you know different brushes different sizes
try a big one like that and it looks like we can kind of do vector lines here as well
I discover something really cool about the pen is if you unscrew it you can see can
I focus on that you get these three spare nibs sitting in the bottom there like that
you can also get different curse pair nips you can get some that feel like felt tips
and I think for a hobbyist or somebody starting out doing digital painting this is everything you need to get
by Acer and features a core i3 Broadwell processor 4 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage
applications sells for between 450 and $600 depending on where you buy it and at 450
it's a reasonably powerful machine that offers decent performance but there are some quirks to keep in mind for 600
sell so one thing is that it's not the most portable two-in-one device that you're likely to find it
I've typed with this on my lap and actually had to fall over onto the floor
we'll get to in a second here but the over here we've got a headset jack
that's that's a quick look at sort of Windows 8.1 running on the Acer Aspire switch 11
it doesn't have the ability to flip the screen backwards the way the Acer switch series does but honestly
the tablet itself has a live area of ten inches by six point to five inches
I knew that after drawing three lines on it I would never be able to get it fully
you can see those here along the side you can set those to any keyboard shortcut your little heart desires
there's also the zoom wheel you can scroll in resize your brushes do that sort of thing with it
I was wondering that too am I ever gonna accidentally tap them in my time using it
to accidentally toggle settings on and off the texture of the tablet itself feels good to draw on
found the lines to be smooth and I was genuinely surprised at how nice it was to draw with
we have friends with kids and in school a lot of times these kids look at these
that they already have that they can use and learn with and my answer is usually oh those
but if you're cool with not having any pressure and all you want is something that's accurate on a
you know drawing pads or writing pads they can be used by a wide range of audience
it feels like you're holding a pen or a pencil in your hand and when it comes to drawing
okay let me zoom it over here all right you can see over here maybe no okay
they can just practice their lettering and so on and students a square plus 2 a b plus b square
yeah over here i have locked it now so now if i press the erase button nothing happens
so yeah everything goes back and it when it comes to the power kind of consumption
draw some lines like this and it's pretty good all right i would say that's it for uh this video
let me focus over here where you can just slide the stylus like this pretty nifty
uh i wish you all the nice weekend and i will see you all in my next one all right
I have been using a new graphic tablet here on HS 610 which means every true
you have seen since October starting from creating custom brushes and Photoshop has been created using huion pen tablet
I'm not good at drawing but still it turns out good and as you can see right now
you can use it as your mouth guard so you can control your whole computer not only that
so and over here the smoothness is really good as you can see to remove the background
I have painted over there in the edges that was really easy for me because I was using the tablet
there's no lag and it's so compatible with my Mac that I don't feel like I haven't used this ever
keys where you can customize so right now it's default some of these are default some of them
a stylus pen has two buttons over here lower and the top one so at the bottom
I have kept it to brush because I want the shortcut brush or via so I've kept it to brush
it's depends on you you can rotate the angle and anything is like so right now
I'm using it in pieces so I want the full area and apply it like this
it's a budget tablet but still give you the best performance you want from a tablet
Yan Q 11k wireless graphics tablet and who yung actually sent me this tablet to review
simple clean and very secure as well and it makes good use of the space inside the box
that's what you'll be seeing throughout this video when I talk about my opinion my personal opinion of the tablet
it makes it feel more natural and you can actually customize the pressure sensitivity of the pen
that is really easy on your program to get thick and thin lines and the pen felt very natural
like there's nothing about it that felt foreign to me and I'm not really used to using a pad tablet
I started to kind of get back into the swing of it and it was very comfortable experience overall
Android tablet that as the name implies has a ten inch display and it sells for just $100
which again a little bit on the low side but for just basic video streaming and some light web browsing
so with something like this might be good for reading some text books ebooks things like that
I find it to be a good panel for the price with good viewing angles and solid overall color reproduction
it also gets decently bright when you're taking it outdoors if you want to crank up
the max brightness the only downside is again the resolution isn't the highest but that's debatable
so there's still a slight gap between the glass on the top and the display underneath
there's a bit more of a depth there we are running on a very stock install of Android 8.1 Oreo
720p resolution so the pixels are more spread apart on a larger screen but nonetheless it still works quite well
and it's definitely a stereo pair so better than a mono speaker but it is quite tinny sounding
all the content seems to be loading along just fine including the ads and video content
plus it will take up less space to install as well loading things along you can see
it's not going to be quite as fast in terms of frame rates as maybe a flagship phone the latest
Snapdragon processor but overall for a budget device it works quite well once the game itself is open
it's still quite smooth and responsive as far as interaction is concerned the touchscreen is very sensitive
so that's more or less it for our hands-on review of the dragon touch K 10 for only $100
compared to tablets that we used to see for only $100 or so it's closest competitor is still the aforementioned
that's a little bit easier to pick up and immediately start using it also has a physical
you can check out more details if interested in the links down below but for now
I would say oh well slightly still expensive but you know the build quality and everything is amazing
it also has a front camera of 3 megapixel rear camera of a mer pixel billion is 107 point
it takes a few other things as well like you had up to 13 hours of battery life
it tells you if you think if you all of things downloaded you tell you what
II can't get this full run around 150 pounds and it's worth it okay so I do highly recommend it
so the tablet comes with two rechargeable pens which have a charging cable a screen protector and
I think $1600 so they're really expensive in general not that they're in a not good quality
they don't really have the money to pay $1600 on a tablet unless they're really passionate about it and so
it would be cool if we could find cheaper alternatives them to some of the more expensive
they are increased brush size decreased brush size zoom in zoom out a new hand brush and eraser and
I hope it was a little bit useful to you and that it introduced you to another brand
nothing too fancy but at the same time it lets you know what everything does so
I've noticed unlike the XP pen you actually don't need to uninstall your Wakeham drivers that's neat anyways right now
you can actually do it so it runs a program which is pretty neat for a majority of osoo players
we have the digital pen settings you have two programmable buttons and you can make them defines if you play
Oh sue the first thing you're gonna want to do is disable Windows Inc which is enabled by default
I didn't have any problems with it one thing I will note though is every time you change this
I've gotten I think ten hundred PP plays with this tablet so for the average player
the pen is lightweight and it's actually battery free compared to the 420 so that's a really big improvement
just because you're more likely than not gonna want to go with a 480 but for a majority of people
I reviewed it was a lot of fun and I do plan on using this tablet quite a bit more
the OS comes free of any bloatware and the only pre-installed app is razors game launcher
I found it capable of running just about anything I threw at it running Crysis 3 at native resolution
of course the game had to be scaled down to low settings but even at its lowest configuration
but these aren't unsolvable problems and the edge is making a giant leap forward for the gaming tablet category
Walmart's on-brand now has a small collection of extremely low-cost Android tablets but even at such a low price
the 8 inch on tablet costs a measly sixty-four dollars and this 10.1 inch version costs $79
so if you're expecting the usual review or we talk about premium specs and amazing performance
the device this inexpensive is guaranteed to suffer some serious trade-offs for that low price and the on 10.1
LCD display with a resolution of 800 by 1280 if your eyes have become accustomed to high PPI counts
think back to when touchscreens were resistive and you'll have a sense of what the display actually feels like
the plastic backing on the back is texturized which keeps it from slipping holding it in my hands nicely
some advice also has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core MediaTek MT 8163 processor with 2 gigs of ram
this episode of hands-on tech is brought to you by aftershocks aftershokz headphones use patented bone conduction
technology they rest just outside your ear and produce sound by sending vibrations through your cheek bones
maybe read an e-book or watch a movie this is what this tablet is really designed for
just how laggy things can be on lower-end devices and I mean it didn't totally fail
things aren't as snappy as I'm used to in my pixel but it wasn't god-awful either
very jerky which is a bummer because I had hoped this tablet would be a good low-cost kids device
this isn't the ideal take it to the beach and read a novel device now as for watching content my
hey it's a movie on a 10-inch device and that on account for something now that navbar tweak that
which is pretty awesome if anything stands out on me on 10.1 inch when compared to its
it's only just enough technology to get by and even there it kind of falls short
this model has several improvements it now supports pressure sensitivity up to 8000 levels has tilt sensitivity
quick start guide menu and a card with links to where you can download the driver usb data cable
the two side buttons here can be customized to various mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts and pen tip
the top and bottom are curved but the sides here they are angular there are 12 physical shortcut
overall build quality seems to be quite solid and the drawing surface has a nice mesh texture to it
the functionality for the mac and windows driver is essentially the same except with the windows driver
if you are a left-hander let's do some quick line quality test the app that i'm using here
you can expect the same drawing performance with the drawing apps on mac os as well
i was able to map this vertical area here to the vertical format of the phone
i have tested on both mac and windows so for the price of less than u.s 16
which is the price i was able to find on aliexpress with free shipping to selected countries
i'll put some purchase links in the video description below for you guys to compare prices all right
we're going to take a look at the Insignia flex 11.6 inch two and one convertible windows tablet
so the tablet can become a standalone tablet away from the keyboard if you so want now
because the latches are on the sides the magnetic latches that keep it in place or on the side
so if you want to carry it around or you want to close it up put it to sleep
the desktop looks a little different than it does in what we would consider desktop mode now
obviously it's 1080p on the 11 inch its 720p on the 8 inch and so not only
do you have the extra screen real estate but you got the keyboard and you also have
those are the two of them together and that is the Insignia 11.6 inch flex tablet for Best
so it's not always the easiest to get your hands on screen protectors or cases or anything like that
we actually have an aluminum shell which covers most of the back and then along the two sides
the rear camera is capable of capturing footage in 1080p HD which is nice in terms of internal memory
the interface is really slick and it runs really well on this device with all the specs
but what we want to do on this channel is we want to max this out
I'm not gonna bother with things like dolphin to try to get Gamecube and Nintendo Wii running on it
so we're gonna go ahead and download that and we're gonna see how well it runs on
let's go ahead and load up retroarch and see how this thing handles basic emulation for
the screen looks really good and the game runs almost perfect and just to make sure that isn't a fluke
let's go ahead and see how this runs now that we've got this game running for a little bit
now let's move on to n64 for this we're going to be using the mutant 64
and in terms of button mapping it's all up to you on how you want to do it
I finished us off with some super mario 64 just to see how it runs now
this is something that most devices can play or at least they can play fairly well
this actually ran really really well and I honestly felt like I was playing it on the actual n64
it just would not run properly crazy glitching it was very slow there was really bad
FPS drops so I ended up installing the standalone and it runs so much better now
I finished us off with some Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and that game absolutely ran perfectly
there was no issues whatsoever and then to really push this device as far as I thought it could handle
there wasn't any framerate drops and it was just really playable and then to finish us off
but it doesn't have wireless charging and only two gigs of RAM so I opted for the plus version here
gigs of ram and built-in wireless charging base price is 109 99 and inside of the box
I do want to mention that this is not as powerful as the 2019 Fire HD 10
CPU this is a MediaTek 81-68 the GPU is the Mallee g52 mc1 we have three gigs
I did was install Google Play using my old tutorial for the 2019 fire 8 and it works fine
I got a lot of stuff installed here so this tablet is perfect for viewing Netflix Disney
I could never get it to work but I was able to get it to work on the fire
so with that out of the way let's go ahead and test some native android games
HD alright so first up we have pub G mobile now this is a very well optimized game
I was actually able to run this on the Fire HD 7 and it ran pretty decently but right here
I'm pretty sure it would run just as well on the standard version next on the list we have
I'm using the beta version here from the Google Play Store so I have the FPS on screen
definitely not the best that I've seen but for a budget tablet handling n64 quite well
unfortunately this tablet is just not going to handle these games and finally for my emulation tasks
I would pick that up when it's on sale over the new plus version of the 8
I'll leave some links in the description in case you want to pick up any of the tablets
i'll put a link in the video description where you guys can get this for a good price
okay let's go ahead and see if it's got some power so you guys may have seen my past video
so yeah basically you guys can see your movies and stuff you know since i'm a prime member
it's so simple so easy to do and i did it for my mom on her tablet
so we're gonna do that on here so we can have our google games as well
I'm just going to do something a bit different today and just to have a look at the Kobo tablet
and if you have already done so hit subscribe now where you can stay in the loop for content
I make that helps you to stay safe in the crazy and often hostile environment that is cryptocurrency
alright so this is the Kobo tablet as you receive it inside the box under the cover
no sort of store them in this bag and you'll see why in a second basically the confessed steal cassette
so they're just in these little trays and basically there's nothing really that keeps them in the right one so
you know if you just use the default tiles that come with it for just standard bit 39 past phrases
the letters aren't just printed on there but they are actually engraved and stamped on each one
who just need to make sure you turn the screw backwards a bit until it finds the thread
I'd really recommend you just double check that you've actually got the first four letters of each of them
Kobo tablet and given that you could basically buy three of these for the price of one
I think these are a great deal even comparing it to the crypto steal capsule or which
huion is usually a brownout recommend because one they are quite a bit cheaper than the more conventional
Wacom tablets and second reviews are none have generally always been pretty positive based on what other people have said
these fellows tend to be really reliable and perfectly functional especially given their cheaper price range however
we have a little thank-you card which is quite lovely but the little logo thank you for choosing
so this is of course a key on tablet and then here we have my Wacom Intuos art
oh it has pen nibs no way look at all the nibs so many noobs okay
connect this to my computer and download drivers and then we can take it for a spin okay
so here's what the settings and options will now look like when everything has been installed
we have a curve here under the pen settings option which you can use to adjust a pressure sensitivity
perhaps this wouldn't be the best suited to someone looking for making final line art again
sure this new hue on tablet did have certain features that were different from my usual drawing devices
but never underestimate how quickly you can learn to understand the feel and the nuances of the tablet
which is a huge advantage and one less thing to worry about the excess of nibs
drawing tablet it would slide super seamlessly into a handbag or a pocket of a backpack
you can have it there and from your laptop with enough room for your coffee and muffins
AP graphics drawing tablet it is under $100 it's perfectly usable it's I would have to say utterly adorable
I would give it a B so you know go check it out in the meantime my name is Jax
in this class it's available with a wide range of options including up to a core i5
you don't need any extra accessories to plug-in peripherals like an external display removable storage USB mouse or keyboard etc
I believe select models are available with up to this backing up to 37 watt hour battery
applications is go ahead and pull out a notebook accessory so this is the mobile keyboard
I said you can get maybe up to 13 or 14 hours battery life depending on usage
so when you put these two together whole thing weighs maybe a little over three pounds
it's as I mentioned faster most Intel Atom based systems and faster than other bait rails tablets
I've tested in terms of transcoding video audio creating the zip archive files and so forth
at little feuding com we can watch videos in Full HD and it works just fine
just click the apply button and now you can fit more on the screen in fact
side-by-side looks pretty good in terms of how much you can fit on the screen again
you can't really easily see pixels individual pixels but the high-resolution screen really does work a little bit better
CPU inside unless you go with the core i3 which is a dual core these are ultrabook
shock vibration is its ip65 rated for water and for dust so that means splashing water
Kelvin number I've ever seen but again it's not an infographic artist this so that's fine and the color accuracy
not a fine art product obviously like a lot of business products in vertical market products
that's a lot of battery power for something that's essentially in ultrabooks so as you might imagine in full
so if you're using an outdoor is bringing a couple of spare batteries by using it indoors
you can actually open this up to service it and you've got the m2 which is a socketed
be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel for more cool tech videos and hit that notification bell
this has a pen stand and this box as the cables already taken then out so
it's mostly made of hard plastic so for this particular tablet it comes with 8 physical shortcut keys
this is an l-shaped connector that goes right here and this is the charging cable for the stylist
cut buttons here and right at the back that gives little hope for charging the tent
press keys here you can customize the physical shortcut buttons on the tablet with your keyboard shortcuts
it can be an issue if you're working on some project and then the battery runs out
I'm just going to show you some strokes drawn with a little pressure and heavy pressure
here let me show you how two strokes transition and also how they taper now they taper a bit abruptly
I'm saying this tablet does very well the apps that I'm using right now is called affinity photo
they have their own characteristics for so when I choose this brush here and I pick this
there are not a lot of features but that's not to say that there are no bleaches is just that
strangely seeing applies to Photoshop a bit strangely but that is quite rare so earlier on
overall this is a very decent wireless tablet now the size personally for me is a bit too big
I ever do where I have to use a regular graphics tablet I am NOT proficient with these things anymore
looks like something you would get at a store which is really really nice on the back here
you'll see the little disc thingy which gives you where you can download the drivers on their website
link is right there and now let's pull her on out of here she's little snug
it's just not very convenient trying to drop things out of there but there we go
I like it when it's on the side and also you can see on the back
it has a nice little rubber mat pieces to help keep it stable and yeah the back looks really nice
I'm kind of switching over to the a basically a view where you can see my hand again
I kind of work a little slowly here maybe I can kind of work something out yeah
the pen is very very light because it's a battery list and you don't need to charge or anything
I don't think you can kind of see where those are by my finger right there
Labs OBS to record this and this is basically how I stream so I do video game streams
I don't care about any of that what I care about can the product product that I'm using
I wanted the white is because I knew I wanted to sketch cars and when you sketch cars
you just go to the website you download the specific drivers for the model that you have
so that's the only change that I had to do by in all the cables and you're good to go
it's auto minus plus menu and of course the power button and these are the buttons
it's this one right here and compared to my old pen that I use with the wake
I do prefer this pen over this pen for the simple reason that this feels more natural
Photoshop is you bring up the all your brushes so you can just quickly click there
I haven't considered getting a display tablet to replace my into us the first reason is
but the tablet has 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity and the work area is 496 millimeters across diagonally
it's still the best tablet that I've ever owned and I will never get rid of it
but for the main tablet in the office we have a new King on the throne
you will be called for sketch duty when needed if you're interested in the Huey on cameras
20 simply click the link in the description to learn all the details and order yours
maybe depending on the game intensity and screen brightness also you can customize display style found icon color and shape
i like this sort of red and round rectangle border so i created and saved this style
now it's not all sunshine and rainbow and i found some bugs that are here and there
but it kinda is that sometimes so i realized that the lights on the home screen stopped working previously
and somehow it just won't work at all so i've been using passcode to unlock the device
another thing that i've not been able to do is multi-window view previously in android 7
i can use two apps side by side or i can minimize them but in lineage 17.1
hello guys in today's video we're gonna check out the top 5 best budget tablets in 2020
if you'd like to win one of these products make sure you watch the whole video
the cameras are not the best on this one they has a 2 megapixel rear and front facing cameras
it felt a bit heavy compared to other tablet but it surely is easy to carry
I think that this tablet is worth it as I started to get used to it
this one is for whoever enjoys a good enough tablet with a great performance and an amazing design
IPS LCD screen with 2048 by 1536 pixels Zen pan has 16 gigabytes 32 gigabyte or 64 gigabyte storage
it also has touch responsiveness of 20 milliseconds when I first took the Asus n pad s8
I can say that it's one of the best because I do everything with these tablet work
s8 want to cool my mind a bit and place in games or have some fun
I spent too many hours watching videos and having fun with this tablet the high resolution and color display
surprisingly provides good gaming performance too it has 4 gigabytes around the arm bar liji 71mph graphics
it's easy to use and provides great qualities and at number one it's the Samsung Galaxy Tab
the only disadvantage is that it has limited storage however the solid sharp screen and killer battery life
I tested it by opening up some apps and open some tabs in Google Chrome first
it didn't lag at all but I noticed some minor system lag as I continued the testing nonetheless
it did a great job and I'm very thankful to some some for making this cheap
but amazing tablet you can use it wherever you want to and thanks to the battery life
I think that this tablet is the best compared to other budget tablets in the market
you should definitely consider the tab full if you've decided to buy a tablet thanks for watching
this one looks a bit nicer and feels just a bit higher end at the same time
I've got the ite version and in this case the nano SIM slot is located at the exact same place
by the way you can use the 4G version to make phone calls and send text messages
don't expect to take any nice surface for Instagrammer so it is still usable for video chats using Skype
it's bright enough to use comfortably inside but even outside on a cloudy day it is a bit dark
we get a 1.3 gigahertz mediatek worship and the ite version features a 1.1 gigahertz quad core shop
in both cases we also get 1 gigabyte of RAM and an 8 gigabyte or 16
already actually that is not bad at all because tablets from Huawei and Samsung usually use more
this is not a magic tasking device even if something is installing in the background from the
I love that we almost get vanilla and word here unlike its competitors from Amazon Huawei and Samsung do you
but in theory you can run two apps side by side inside the Lenovo Tab seven essentials
it's a battery with the capacity of 3500 milliamp hours according to Lenovo that should last up to 20 hours
if you play games and higher if you just read e-books it always depends on what you're doing so can
I cannot considering the price the build quality is good and the display is fine too
well let's take a look at a couple of the main competitor is the 7-inch Amazon fire
if you have any questions just write me down below i'm android for my next subdued calm
so what's interesting about this device here is it's the priced incredibly you know some of the competitors that
you can go all the way up to 20 forward phrase so actually if you have sale
you could actually back up to wallets for the price of one on this if you really really wanted to
so if you have a little padlock or anything like that do you want to keep it secure
but very very durable and this is again has a very very high water rating corrosion rating and fire rating
worth of crypto on a hardware wallet this is the backup to your backup and the paper
recovery seed wallets are nice to have but as you know paper is not indestructible and bad
the standard comes with it comes with the 24 word phrase so that will completely cover
obviously you need the first four letters of your recovery seed phrase and then you'll unscrew
I mean this is really really high quality device but anyone that has cryptocurrency and has a recovery seed phrase
there's nothing you could do that was Bitcoin those for Bitcoin now are gone to the ether
they will never see the light of day again and his Hardware wallet because he had it for several years
I review all of them but I actually use them as well for all of my hardware wallets
it's a small layout it is twelve inches so it depends on how you do with smaller keyboards
even though it's you know it's going to have a hollow effect against the desk like that it
they did a really nice job of finishing this and making it look good and you'll see there's a magnetic
you get the same surface like thing and you can either use it with the keyboard flat on the desk
I didn't have much like anything to stay the Magnus hold it firmly in place there so there you go
modules to connect to the bottom of this and I perhaps better thought-out than the LG g5 smartphone
Windows love it works pretty well and on this side over here not much to talk about another stereo speaker
so you look a little less noisy and grainy when you're doing Skype video chat so the display
I took it out the box and looked at the screen was oh this is nice
that's fairly decent score there and again performance falls somewhere between a core i3 and a core i5
we expect tablets to have relatively long battery life often but that's not always the case
Lenovo mix 700 which is the consumer version for lack of a better word of this ThinkPad
Wow look at this I kick the iPads but I run so long in a charged kind of product
it's quick certainly suddenly Windows Journal which we're using here our OneNote can keep up just fine
Wacom does a good job with that pressure sensitivity of course is there if I press heavy
the front facing camera is a 3 megapixel camera and rear facing is a 5 megapixel camera
and as you can see some of these videos especially if you hold one of these for yourself
and that's a big plus for the blackberry playbook that's one of the big positives going for it that
i really enjoyed the operating system and the gestures and the multitasking worked really well battery
we're going to talk about a 10 inch off-brand visual land never heard of them figured
I've got the surface there's something something about the Android system that I really really like so I was like
I'm looking for something with a gig of ram I've had 512 before no dice not for me
five point multi-touch 5.0 picture so that's not that big a deal reading comics on and cool games
it's not sealed so if you're picking one up make sure this is my second one
it's got some some kind of notch ins and take a little bit of a second
I know I don't use usually do this but like I said the best boxing ever for an awful
I haven't use these because I'm probably returning it and I'll get to that in a minute
it has a USB to micro USB converter where you can plug the flash drive press each ten
I don't know why you need to know that that's the entertainment page when you've got YouTube
that was pretty quick and honestly again especially for a lower-end tablet one gig of ram dual core processor
that doesn't have its own display to use the media device so yeah overall really decent system
I like it I would say buy it honestly obviously the new one with Google Play
well the stuff is there but there's just something there's just something comforting about the Google Play Store
Play it loaded just to the point where you start installing things and it crashes four rounds with that
I wasn't having none of it and they're really kind of solid my experience on it
has it built in so they don't have to play around that portion of it cuz
the only problem I have with it is the way it is held against the laptop
compared to the x1 carbon a three by two aspect ratio is perfect for doing work-related tasks
it's fantastic over a hundred percent srgb and four hundred or close to four hundred and fifty nits of brightness
this is an eight megapixel camera and I was actually quite surprised how good it is now obviously
audio is pretty clean and clear with good highs and mid but the volume itself is not very
it has the exact same layout as the x1 carbon but the travel distance is obviously less
Windows precision drivers so overall they offer a great experience so the performance on the x1 tablet is great
Excel you're not gonna see that much of a speed difference compared to last year now
you're not gonna play any modern titles on this tablet but it can't handle some older titles like csgo
I was baking around five to five and a half hours of use before needing to charge now
with that 32 gigabyte capacity they have a 64 gig available for 189 that again is with the ads
it looks fairly close to what you would get on the entry-level iPad which costs a lot more
so it's a really really nice display to look at and read on that very pleased with it
the one issue though of course is that this is a 16 by 9 aspect ratio
so you can't plug in a dock and get all this other stuff going with it however you can plug
the images are not great but they're adequate for taking a quick photo every once in a while
it really feels like a more expensive device than it is so for basic things like web browsing
I think a nice overall performer again for doing the basics like watching web video and browsing the web
there's also a lot of apps available for this but it's important to note that although this tablet is running
has their own app store that they use so if you bought a an app on Google
it's got again that upgraded octa-core processor which is delivering smoother gameplay in Minecraft here for example
Amazon said this was only a 30% increase but here we are more than doubling our performance
also at this moment cost twice as much as this tablet does and for a budget offering
I think it's probably the nicest display I've seen on a sub $200 tablet and overall
I just the lower-priced version will give you advertisements when you boot it up but generally
let me know what you think down in the comments below and until next time this is
LAN Simon thanks for watching this channel is brought to you by the lon TV supporters including gold level supporters
I realized after finishing the video that this pen holder doesn't just hold the pin this way
okay yes screw it on screw it on and you got a little pin pin holder
I'm not sure how or where cuz I've never really had one of my own drawing tablets
oh there's the plug on the side there to plug it you've got like a meter cable
four of them which makes it sit nicely on the disk and this cable just goes up
I guess and that's just meaning from each corner of the tablet goes to those corners
hey guys just wanted to say my overall thoughts on the tablet at the end after
I would say six hours straight drawing some pictures and I didn't feel any pains or anything
this is the knobby to a touchscreen tablet designed with kids in mind that boasts some impressive features
the strangest thing about the appearance is the grid of slightly protruding squares on the back
such as this is the durability although it appears somewhat fragile the knobby tube is quite sturdy
you can't go dunk it in water but it holds up well two drops and bumps the biggest concern
and if you don't want to scroll you can condense them on to one page mommy
it is a bit more adult in its layout with similar icons all in one page sound quality
let's plus TV and spin let's plus music for TV it is like Netflix for kids
the Navi 2 comes with a lot of demos of popular games like Angry Birds and fruit ninja
there's room for plenty more apps and games the Nabi 2 is impressive and not just by kids standards
that turned on you get it started up and other things that are going to come in
you just get a matte black finish on the back and you get the samsung logo
4.2 6 000 milliamp hour battery and as i mentioned you do have usbc charging on day
if you've never had a tablet this is going to be a great one to start out with
i'm just going to show you how gameplay handles on here um we'll just turn the volume down first
uh gameplay looks really really good there are no issues everything is moving really nice really fluid
all the apps are really simple really convenient especially with samsung's one ui overlaying this guys
maybe check their bank account or maybe do some video chats video calls facebook instagram things of that nature
this is daniel confirm arena presenting the Xperia z2 tablet which takes those same superlatives away from its predecessor
sony used its omnibalance design language with a signature circular power key creating a well-crafted slate with soft edges
LED and uses red and green phosphor with blue LEDs and has tailored color filters on top
the case with the z2 tablet as its triluminos panel shows vivid somewhat and realistic colors
PPI pixel density given that we have high-end Samsung slates with 1600 P screens for example
the issue with the display is not the pixel density but rather its high light reflectance ratio
it's a big flatness that we measured the IPS panel surf viewing angles are very good and overall
the screen of the z2 tablet is an improvement over its predecessor if not in resolute and an image quality
Sony bets on a few branded apps like the Walkman music player or the Timescape social aggregator widget
Sony uses its album app in place of a stock gallery and offers plenty of picture
itself your video collection goes in the movies app which also boasts a pretty interface with footage previews
the placement of these speakers is such that you won't block them with your hand while holding the tablet
Sony's camera app like automatic scene recognition mode augmented reality overlays or an HDR photo regime by default
compared to reality yet still very pleasant to look at the camera captures plenty of detail in
there are a lot of drawing tablets out there but which one is right for you
it also comes upon with software that you can use for making art and editing photos
Wacom so you'll have to weigh whether the Express keys and additional pressure levels are worth it
this is the pro version of the Intuos with top-of-the-line features and specs at eight point
the medium intuos pro is only slightly larger than the regular Intuos medium but the large Intuos
I personally prefer a surface with a bit of friction because it feels closer to drawing on paper
this is the end of the line for tablets without a display from here on out
Welcome one not to be confused with the one by Wacom the Wacom one was released in 2020
Android is not quite as robust as the experience you'd get by drawing on a Windows or Mac computer
these are essentially the same tablet just in different sizes aside from the difference in size
if you're more of a beginner or hobbyist and the pro level features don't matter to you choose the
how many pressure levels you need and you might be surprised at my number one choice so stay tuned
I just prefer to use my keyboard so I can live without express keys as with the Wacom one
but you have the option of purchasing an optional stand that can be adjusted to provide more angles
Pro features you could get by just fine with one of the non pros antiques moving on to number three
pro 24 and 32 support multi-touch both devices also support the pro pen 2 and you
I'd say a stand is essential for either of these tablets because they're so large in terms of portability
they require a lot of desk space and they are not easy or convenient to lug around
I know you're saying but Aaron you just told me that a larger tablet was better
Goldilocks and I just think that the 24 feels too small and the 32 is too massive
USBC cable you can use to connect the Cintiq pros but that's okay with me in terms of color accuracy
let's check this thing out and see if it's any good let's have a look the X go
and you can see all those pixels and the glass is super reflective and not very thick
it doesn't work properly and look so clicky and blue and running videos on it it's terrible
option these look pretty good as supernovas flash across the screen your seeds floating leaves in water
but they don't do anything to add to the experience because you'll be so frustrated with B software
so anything you want to do will be hampered by buggy a million software issues guaranteed
it does come with a semi leathery case thingy with a keyboard but when you plug that in
it includes a front and rear facing camera it has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity for audio
I will say this is one of the most minimalist packages I've seen for a tablet
I have seen a video of it being dropped repeatedly without the screen cracking or damage to the plastic
this is an android-based tablet but it does not have native support for the Google Play Store
the home screen has a tab layout that shows the focus on this being an entertainment device
I shop on Amazon use audible Kindle books and prime video so the quick access is nice for me
HD tablet is when it's plugged in it goes into show mode once show mode is enabled
it'll act like an echo device with hands-free being a fire device though it not all echo features are available
this is where this device is not worth it for me with my iPad or iPhone
I could take care of 90% of my work needs or tasks that I need to get done
I've been impressed at having an echo show that I can play live TV on watch
I would not want it for trying to get emails done real web browsing writing documents or other tasks
I think it's definitely worth the price for and it so enabled device to incorporate into your Echo household
if you like this video please hit that like button if you haven't consider subscribing and hit that
in terms of this caliber of device you can see the actual a viewing angles are pretty decent here
so you can die from using the keyboard and the actual trackpad to actually using the screen
but you might want to keep that on to help with the glare issues because it is that
in terms of the performance you can see the screen looks absolutely fantastic when web browsing
I want to do a little bit video editing and things like that you probably should get the full gig
here is quite heavy considering how small the actual devices also the cameras you know garbage
I loved a design that lenovo's going for now build quality and design of these new Tab series
this has an 8 core 2.3 gigahertz CPU instead of a quad core 2 gigahertz and
I mean it's not the loudest Ablett that I've heard but it'll get you by for a smaller tablet
this only comes in one color and it's known as iron gray one of the main things
HD this is a great little tablet for viewing videos if you want to stream from let's say plex
then the lower-end m8 HD and how it stacks up against 150 dollar Amazon Fire HD 10
Geekbench 5 single core 165 multi 878 even with the higher clock CPU in this tablet
with the single core score of the ma HD but it did beat it out in multi unfortunately
now it's time to move over to some GPU testing we have 3d mark with slingshot
and if you're looking at a more expensive tablet think about the Tab s 6 at 300 77856
this is a playable game on these little tablets but this is a very well optimized game the controller
Xbox one or your Xbox one X this is dirt rally 2.0 running in Project X cloud
I think this would be an awesome little option pair it with a controller like the AI
I really appreciate you watching if you have any questions or you want to see anything else
tested with the lenovo tab and 8f HD just let me know in the comments below but like always
today i'm going to review another display tablet by xp1 which is xp and artist 22r pro
so this is how the tablet looks like from the front it has 20 shortcut keys and two red dials
you can keep it at any angle of your choice like this like this also or simply like this
this is a type c2c cable as you can see so it is very useful for mac users
i will connect this plug to the pc and this plug to the tablet and the hdmi to hdmi cable
the first thing you need to do is to install the xp pen driver experiment software
22r pro is written here so using the software you can adjust various settings like the pressure sensitivity soft hard
just click on the express key settings and you can assign various features here so as i told you earlier
also you can see three features there so the first one is zoom in and zoom out
what do you think about this product and you have any doubts you can ask me
they call it an ultra tablet because it has a keyboard and can do a bit of multitasking
there's nothing a major really but there have been updating and working hard the team on that so
very good to type on the keys are individually spaced out so you get a lot less typos
yes the remix have done a really good job and designing this different kind of materials that I have used
I noticed that the keyboard on the remix will pick up a lot of dust and dirt quite quickly
I wish it would clip in there just a little bit nicer be slightly stronger there
it's not too bad it's just you have to sometimes be careful when you do pick up
just the tablet and let the keyboard flop down that it could just come off now
applications like the calculator and things and have them pop up while switching between other things like the browser
here and the back button here you can control the volume straight away from the speakers which
if you don't like it perhaps you're typing and you know that you do have it so
they're quite good tablet speakers there and the front-facing webcam is a microphone on the front
it might have been something to do with the the taskbar they have at the bottom
it didn't seem to appear later on when I was benchmarking so this is unreal Citadel
I think and this is the ice storm unlimited score 3dmark not a bad score and I should have here
it's not a super a powerhouse or anything it's not like the fastest octa-core CPU anything like that
even when it's not plugged in keyboard also has a couple of nice little features here including adjustable backlighting
pretty easily you can pay more than $7.99 if you want more memory more storage and a faster processor
I haven't had any problems doing things like watching videos while surfing the web and editing documents
it's a tablet that you could use for work for play for all sorts of different things
finish very nice to touch but it also is a little bit of a dust not just magnet but trap
I find it's kind of hard to keep clean and living in a house with three cats
they need a little bit more sort of room on your screen you could go to maybe 175 or 150
I'm looking at two different web pages but that's just because of the way that I tend to work
if your needs are different there are a whole bunch of different things you can do
I use the tablet and even though I have my eyes fixated on the screen of April
movies and 708 is approximately 36 pounds over at gearbest for the price and specification of the M 708
I did a jitter test with pressure levels off to try and get the most accurate results
I would say there is ever so slightly more gesture than my work on mobile shoo
the driver itself doesn't take you long to install and once it is installed the tablet settings
in comparison to max which is a good thing as it allows space for more customization it also meant
crashes or any need to unplug and we can at the end 708 after waking up windows
my previous pen tablet was a Wacom Bamboo which was smaller and the active area was limited
having a large active area definitely made the drawing experience easier apart from the driver installation issues on window
I would definitely recommend this as a pen tablet for anyone looking to start off with a cheap yet
there don't ever feel like you have to spend lots of money to be able to create beautiful artwork
it's actually one of the best value budget gaming laptops out there which is really really cool again
obviously it says legion obviously with large letters just like imagine carrying a box like this down the street
i haven't i haven't unboxed this before i'm just saying this because i've seen the unboxing this you know
uh do i do this as well because i'm actually really bad at unboxing stuff obviously
it's got a really nice texture just for this side there you go throw it away
just save this and over here we have a 3.5 inch headphone jack and one uh usb 2.0
we have the nice lenovo logo hits like brushed metal kind of finish which is quite cool
i'm just gonna place it in the center of the camera from the looks of things
uh there are these rubber pads that stand on the table uh and everything else is plastic
let's take a look on the inside of this thing and i'm not the real inside of this thing
of course i've got here is just show you the ryzen 4000 series rather than five the integrated radeon graphics
it's almost like soft touch but it's not really soft but it's soft at the same time
you can just feel the clicks going on and i think this keyboard will be great for gaming
i do like this laptop from the first like first like what five minutes 10 minutes
touch panel with a 1366 by 768 pixel resolution with no capacitive buttons around the tick screen bezels
fortunately comes with 64 gigs of emmc storage and can be expanded via a microsd card
the most interesting hardware will be its 8 000 milliamp hour battery which offers an approximate 5 hour of usage
the device is rather capable in many ways and performance is quite okay for simple use
well when i held the device in different angles the only complaint that i have would be its thermal control
the flexibility to switch between a tablet and laptop performance is really acceptable in most cases
This has Alexa built in, which means you don't necessarily need to buy an Amazon Echo.
So, first, let's just look at the speed before I get to some crazy drop tests.
Laptops to tablets, to how to score a free Xbox One or PlayStation-- Wow, this guy's annoying.
I'm gonna show you what the table looks like in a moment, but the screen is completely okay.
I'm now going to smash this with all my might against the side of the table.
One of the things I love about this tablet, is that, at its core, it's an Amazon Echo.
- [Alexa] In Toronto, Canada, it's 46 degrees, with cloudy skies. Tonight, you can look for-- - [Matt] Alexa?
Share a thought from the cloud. - [Alexa] A friend of mine is the voice for an elevator.
(tablet rings softly) - [Alexa] Okay. - [Matt] And at my house right now, the couch light would've gone off.
I actually prefer, just 'cause I'm used to it, the way the iPad feels in my hand.
But, the second I want to watch a movie, and shift from this mode to landscape mode...
So, that's where I think that this shape really comes into play, in terms of weight. Really comparable.
Using two buddies' random selection tool to find a subscriber who's commented in the last six months.
hi everyone this is day even in today's video we're taking a look at this really cool tablet from chewy
so let's take a look around the back first of all maybe a closer look at this
this is a little camera at the top here so we have got a rear facing camera
we've got the main power on/off button and also the volume rocker and then round on this side
I want to just emphasize to you that this does run Windows and also Google Android now admittedly
it is a fairly well respected brand in amongst drawing tablets for budget artists for artists
and this tablet itself is a 16 inch drawing tablet with a 1080p screen and hotkeys
so it might be exactly what you're looking for if you're just starting out on your journey in this review
obviously well not a laminated screen but the parallax on this while probably a little bit bigger than normal
how much of a budget you're on so let's jump into the unboxing portion of the video here
I'm just gonna get everything out and line it all up so you can see all of the pieces together
the first thing that I notice however is that there's a stand here with the D 16
now you also get this little pen holder attachment here as well your pen just solidly clicks
don't know if I wanted to call these a gift personally but yeah there you go
I don't think this kneading it an instruction manual but hey the stand is pretty good
so here's where it's going to get interesting the pen test over 8,000 levels of pressure and 5080
I'm getting everything I expect to see in a normal pressure test so yeah fully fully
remember lag is caused by the programs and the computer never by the pen or the tablet
the camera is down as low as possible with the monitor tablet so you can see clearly here
tablet like this link in the description if you want to go and chase one yourself
I thought I would do something a little more like that to show off what this pen
this tablet could do give the axial d16 a bit more of a trial room before
here's the first draw test and I was happy with how this tablet performed this for me
this works fine for any other drawing application that you're using in as well obviously the one thing
firstly you're gonna notice straight away is as I've just mentioned the math screen but color variations
accuracy isn't at the forefront of your mind so don't worry about it go ahead just have fun
I've got to say I had plenty of fun drawing on this and it worked out perfectly for me
this might be the tablet for you but you really need the hotkeys and you really want a stand
here's the second and third drawer test for you including the one before and the one in the pen test
I just don't think there's enough time in the world to compare every tablet to of three other tablet
my ideal is always to go for the best pen technology possible and go for the best screen size
but it's up to you what you're looking for depending on the kind of art that you produce
let me know what you think in the comments below especially to the color artworks that
I have produced the sketches that I've done okay so moving on to our next draw test here
I'm gonna speed it up so you only have to watch me for what about four four minutes so yeah
that's how you start drawing from your imagination you just come up with something and think
so you draw it cuz nobody else is gonna and you know if you type that into Google
I had when I was just you know when they were just starting out was perfectly adequate
it's not about the equipment you use you become a better artist by the work you put in
you can be happy with that if you can find it for a good deal has a matte screen
let me know if you think this is better than something like a drunk tablet without a monitor
mAh capacity here is the box pack and here is the mini HDMI to standard cable
tablet supporting 1 0 to 4 by 600 pixels resolution it's powered by Intel Atom processor running Windows 8.1
USB port on the left side and there is a micro SD card slot at the bottom
there are no physical navigational buttons on the front panel disturb it comes with a 3200
out of the box and it will get the Windows 10 upgrade as per the company
to the native resolution by default it is set to 1 to 8 0 by 768 resolution
I'm going to change to default native resolution that is 1 0 to 4 by 600 pixels
it is much much better but the problem with this resolution is that some of the applications might not work
explorer here is the pen drive 64 GB and I'm also able to access the contents of this pen drive
bravia tv with full HD resolution and as you can see it's not using the full screen on the TV
this means you get the output both on the tablet as well as on the TV
TV with full HD resolution 1 9 2 0 by 1 0 8 0 pixels and
it is using the full resolution capacity so technically my tablet has become a CPU now
this is a very good option if you don't have a PC at home but have a HDMI TV
you can buy this tablet a keyboard and a mouse and kind of have a low cost
you'll find a 1.6 gigahertz Atom processor Nvidia ion graphics and a 4 gig SSD all encased
in a tapered outer shell the result that juju is nearly 19 millimeters thick and a little bit weighty
at just over a kilo it's elongated form isn't great for portability either and as far as tablets go
there's no offline applications to play around with either so when there's no Wi-Fi that means no app fun times
so there's a lot to fix before the juju can go up against even a netbook
it's got a typical kind of HTC monitoring clean look to it particularly like the curve of the bezels
this is the front video camera and your five megapixel rear main camera is here now
it's finally come up as you see like these challenging designs and there's a micro SD card slot here
it's a single core but it's quite fast at 1.5 gigahertz in fact it did very well on quadrant
then we're gonna take a look at the pen cuz obviously that's what sets this guy apart from other tablets
Windows tablet PC at school to doing those very handy drawback there is no ink to text conversion
Kobo books and it starts out with a nice cover view of all the books that are on board
you cannot change the font itself however annotations bookmarks search so certainly 7 inches is great
but there's a place where you can buy some movies and TV shows from HCC service
GPU are definitely up to the task and since this is running Android 2.3 Gingerbread we have flash 10.3
and it's a bit blocky because we're not putting out 1080 to this 1080p 42 inch DVD
honeycomb and honeycomb is just so much more of a modern tablet oriented operating system that offers a better
be nice to see even more applications supporting them so that's the HTC Flyer 7-inch Android Gingerbread tablet

I’ll also show you how to set up, install, and calibrate this tablet for right and left handed people.
The other tablets are a little bit bigger, yet they have few or no shortcut buttons.
much of a difference between 2,000 and 8,000, but the higher number does perform a little bit better.
The PD1560 is about 17” wide and 10” tall, making it the smallest screen tablet I’ve reviewed so far.
I tried drawing with it off and the there was noticeable resistance between the pen and the glass.
My PD1560 had some kind of oily effect between the protector and the screen when I unpacked it.
A USB to charge the pen once in a while. A one finger glove and a two finger glove.
There’s one more thing the PD1560 comes with, and that is a carrying case for your tablet screen.
I’ve never had a tablet come with a case before and because the tablet has a screen protector on it
Fold the stand up and finish tightening the bottom screws if you couldn’t reach them before.
For the last step, plug the two remaining ends into your computer and plug the power in.
The Gaomon PD1560 by default didn’t understand where the cursor is supposed to be when I was using extended monitors.
I swear there’s always one weird thing with setting tablets up and it’s different for each one.
When I started drawing the greys looked a little warm, so I switched the color temperature to sRGB.
You’ll notice that the side-to-side viewing angle for the tablet isn’t as good as my monitor.
The only reason this would be important is if you plan to mount this tiny tablet on a monitor arm.
so so do um is it could take a million a day so uh 75999 foreign
Leon actually emailed me and asked me to review a tablet for you guys in this video
you can use it for drawing writing in general along with graphic design you can even use it for osoo
I don't so which is mega plus with me because I hate charging things and then right here
that's what I really liked about my last seen on tablet the cord was really long so
I didn't have to worry about it putting it too close to my laptop with my current tablet
I could pick it up in my head and I can't wait to use this for four things
I'm really excited for this speedpaint okay so now that I've gone through what the tablet is in the unboxing
who never it came in the mail and I was really excited whenever I got it
I didn't have to worry about all of these buttons and what they do so it was very nice
I am 100% gonna recommend this one and I'm not just saying that because huion sent me this
I absolutely love it and I'll be back next week with a big announcement and yeah bye either you
Its current price on Amazon is £349, so it’s very strongly undercutting Wacom’s offerings of the same size
This can be solved by moving your tools slightly away from the edge, but it’s not the most ideal solution.
here, so you have about as much as control over your work as you could ask for.
I noticed minimal to no real wobble while drawing either, so precision has certainly not been a point of concern.
After a few minutes of playing around, I was able to draw comfortably with almost no issues.
It offers not only basic key presses, but also a combination of key-presses, which is definitely handy
as far as features and thoughts go, so let’s quickly recap with some pros and cons:
For more details on specs and pricing in your region, feel free to check out the description.
this is the 10.1 inch version and it just says pixie on the back around the side
you've got the screen lock volume and memory card slots and you will need a memory card
I got the you draw game tablet for the Nintendo mate is a beginner's computer art tablet of sorts
the stylus while made for smaller hands in mine is will be enough to work with larger hands of adults
we'll work off of the balance of the internal sensors and I also like the size of it
which is your basic drawing program coloring book which has several templates for you to just fill in
so you really do have plenty of time to draw something but you can only draw so much
yes you can draw and edit from all the way back to when you first started well okay
I mean even Art Academy for the DS had tutorials on how to use a program
this might just be the model that I used but it was an inconvenience another complaint
you can't even flip the Wiimote over to make it left-hand accessible and this is not a nitpicky complaint
any but then again it wasn't made to be it was made to be a game
it was made for kids from the get-go and that's just what it is as an artistic training device
Xiaomi it costs right around $300 in rifles Apple's iPad Mini in build quality and specifications
shell that is cool to the touch and most certainly premium the bezels around the 7.9 inch qHD IPS LCD
May 2017 bringing a multitasking feature and apip or picture and picture feature but I mean in my opinion
but hey it's convenient to have for select applications the same can be said about the front-facing sensor though
let's need to see however is that the battery is larger than the previous me pad
thank you for watching and I will see you right back here in the next one see ya
what do I you use tablets for let me show you something this is how I used to consume content
his life is portable big enough to use against serious work done and small enough to make it easily transportable
let's talk a little bit about the physical dimensions of the tablets about 0.4 inches thick at its widest part
which this would be the rear facing camera weighs about 1.2 pounds is said template when its display on here
I'm feeling it it's the same when I'm drawing on the Wacom tablet or the real tablet
the texture feels exactly the same also when you take note of the size of this tablet versus the
this is quite convenient and you have a very convenient place to store it as well
Photoshop to do a drawing demonstration create a new file and Lochte is and use the brush
so let me show you the light touch first with their pen on the tablet so this is quite sensitive
and if you want it to be thick you can just press down hard and the performance is very smooth
there's no glitch or anything on the Mac OS so let me switch over to the windows now now
I have already installed the driver so I'm just going to plug in my wireless receiver onto the surveys
i'm going to hit the b button and zoom in to show you the strokes pressure sensitivity works very well
I will also post links to all the software that I talked about in the video description
see you in the next video and remember to subscribe to my youtube channel for more
light sensor down on the bottom and then here we have a whole lot of little ports
this is a nice metal chassis and it's got a soft touch finish and do think soft touch finish great
are there if you want to just hit the power button you can do so up top
you can see obviously the Motorola Xoom is a lot bigger a lot more screen real estate
and obviously you're ain't going to be bitten the Motorola Xoom in your pocket wears large pockets
OS 3.0 honeycomb 5 megapixel main rear camera 2 megapixel front video chat camera that works with Google
of course you can do white calling and video chat and all that kind of thing
just scroll through whenever you're interested it's you can just toss it right up there on your screen just say
I want to have my email inbox widget so I just take that and I pick an email account well
this is much more like Chrome but the tabbed interface will show you that of course contacts calendar
so you can scroll through there other videos here and related videos plays in the window there
you can also jump to chapters depending on the book its format and you can do things like change
then we're going to take a look at the web browser which as you can see here supports page
and here's a video when we have it a trauma most of these been mobilized in html5
there you go inline video the New York Times web page in the YouTube mobile player
we have a nice new york city street view surprisingly high quality really and very responsive to panting our home
hey you've got controls for stretching up the timeline and you've got playback controls pretty basic
you can filter by politics and this is mostly about live video and we are doing this over
you can see this is a new version that they just made available which is obviously very tablet aware
but this is looking pretty good so it's nice to see that third party folks are getting their apps
software keyboard that comes with which is simply fantastic does support multi-touch and depending on the size your hands
we're just going to plug this guy right into our HDTV and give it a test alright now
I've hooked up the Motorola Xoom to our HDTV over here and we've used a HDMI 2 mini HDMI cable
so about two months ago the kind folks over at galwan were like we give you tablet
let's just get into the video so today is sunday october 11th and we received this package on
i think this is probably here for um to like uh just soften it like kind of for some padding
i don't know if you can see that and yeah it's just a little case it's orange inside
starting with the basics this is a 15.6 inch drawing monitor with a fully laminated hd screen
which makes a very pleasant sound when using a tablet and keeps the pen from sliding on the screen now
it's a good drawing monitor and i look forward to using it for my future animations so foreign foreign foreign
i watched like catch up channels from telly and a little bit of light web browsing checking my emails
so i don't need this sort of hardcore monster and i wasn't sure what was out there
i've got no idea so i did panic for a second but i got in touch with the team
let's run through some of the specifications and delve a little bit deeper into a semi unboxing
there's two year warranty card a micro usb cable for charging the user manual here was very clear and concise
hey presto even i can do that and i'm not going to bother guiding you through the whole setup process
it's the same as it is on every other machine are they called machines and i didn't have any problems
connecting to my wi-fi took a couple of minutes or less and actually the look and feel instantly
just keep pressing it to return to the home and of course i headed straight for youtube and search myself
there was no difference so it was just a kind of lighting thing here on the camera
it's not the highest resolution in the world but in a way that works to its benefit
because there's less pixels for it to deal with so it's apples and oranges really basically
there's a micro usb port for charging and one of its most popular features is a micro hdmi port
giving you a more customized experience the body of the tablet is made of black metal
it never showed that it was charging and it wouldn't do anything after that first day
is that it states that it comes with hdmi that i want to connect to my tv
needless to say right now i like it and would recommend it to anyone who wants a tablet
read pdfs and books watch videos and do some like internet browsing from time to time
don't hesitate to order if you're thinking about purchasing okay that's encouraging and lisa gives it four stars
when i bought it that being said on with my review the tablet feels well built
youtube runs on it with no lag as does clash of clans game from google play store
the game does not look as crisp clear and colorful as it does on my phone which is a samsung
she's got a similar attitude to me and she's given a generous uh four-star rating as well
so it's probably gone down in price since then i think roger i do not recommend this tablet
i only wish they had been as accommodating the first time around adding more stars because of customer support
i put the tablet in ipad to case the width a little big but does not affect use the battery
okay so perhaps i was just judging it next to my ipad which was probably a bit unfair
you can go and have a look for yourself to verify that but they seem pretty good
you know if i'd spent 500 on it then no i wouldn't be happy because you know
you have to kind of get used to it being a little bit slower than high spec models
but i can live with it and it's absolutely fine through headphones and especially through bluetooth speakers
i mean they capture obviously sound and vision but not to any kind of quality degree
i'm just trying to do a tutorial on how i make my videos my own style
so here's what the drivers look like after you downloaded it and you can see the settings here too now
not only it can be for wireless but the size of it is very small too
because that's probably where i'll be dming you and lastly follow at xp and aliexpress on facebook
if you have any questions regarding everything the giveaway the tutorial the tablet just leave them below
I said this tablet isn't too advanced and it's not too intricate but it does the job it's heavy
running in the background and a nice refresh was was a good way of fixing that
it's it's responsive the pen is nice its Wireless doesn't need to be charged or anything
I think it was like six hundred different brushes or something and it was like $30
but yeah they've got a ton of brushes and they're all super fun to play with aside from this drawing
there is an 8 inch screen with 1280 by 800 resolution it does have an EPS screen IPS
it does go into turbo mode up to 1.6 gigahertz so it will do that dynamically
the memory configuration is confirmed to be one gigabyte so it's not going to be larger than a gigabyte
I did plug in a 128 gigabyte Samsung evil SDXC and it recognized it just fine
gigahertz only band so it does not support 5 gigahertz so the zoom is pretty good
this is one of my videos here and I'll try to play back part of this
let me just kind of jump around a little bit here so we can see some spinning
and this doesn't seem to provide that there are better options out there but this is a
I think this tablet is worth it it was 56 dollars so I would say yeah
well we'll probably have a future episode making a comparator between the two so stay tuned for that
if so subscribe to my channel and you can receive some future review updates as well thank you
this one's a bit more special because instead of a graphic tablet what I have here is a screen tablet
it gave me all of them but on the ouya website you can choose a specific one
here's the pen charging cable and the cable that is scary and intimidating but hooks up to your cookie
HDMI USB and then power plug on one end and then a baked HDMI on the other end
I like mine high because I'm pretty short and I can't look over my desk without
obviously so you would set it as a second monitor and you can slide your your cursor from both screens
I feel really MLG even though it's drawling tablet I noticed that the buttons on the pen work really well
I've noticed about drawing on this tablet is that it relieves my stress a little bit because I tend to
which isn't the best is that the calibration is not always going to be perfectly accurate
you can't scroll it with your fingers like you would a phone because it's not a touchscreen another thing
the buttons on the side of the tablet and around the tablet are very a very nice smooth material
it's a matte screen and there's no glare and it's really really nice so in general
I mean I'm painting on it right now and it's really not doing me any problems or anything like that
I will add is I kind of wish that the stand went slightly higher right now
you know when you when you draw something you tilt the pen it changes its shape
I always suggest starting digital art on graphic tablet before you go on to a screen tablet
Huyen keeps impressing me with a lot of these products and I'm really happy to do reviews for them
