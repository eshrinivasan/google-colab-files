I always do the same battery
it's a very good result overall
the performance is not the best
hello everybody this is my MSM
there's a power button over here
because it's very simple you can
you just plug it in here
it really helps entertain my kids
there's no it helps with you
the monitor itself is pretty responsive

Android tablet this is Dells refreshed
aesthetic definitely doesn't feel cheap either
and power button on the right
is that the physics scores show

this isn't a 4g lte tablet
it feels you know good quality
i was impressed by the brightness
well we'll give it a 5.
uh it's got a six thousand
you know it's full android 9.
it's got a nice bright screen
and then here's the actual tablet
it came down to two tablets
and that's what this thing has
I prefer to sketch with anyway
the pressure sensitivity is 8,192 levels
it's just a little bit different
the contrast the standard settings works
I'm stuck in my old ways
it's one of the most beautiful
I need to get the job
it's very smooth on gen bot
you can see it's very smooth
hey what's up guys this is
so that's really really good now
I mean maybe 10 inches away
the the glass is perfectly smooth
where the entire thing is sticky
I know some people prefer it
but that's totally up to you
it's really not a big deal
I don't have any issue now
I think that's just fine now
also the last thing to mention

I'd want to do some passionately
which gives you about eight hours
this tablet goes for 65 bucks
you can definitely see the screen
two is a little bit interesting
so you notice the normal ones
that was with the front camera
you're not going to get that
it's not what it's going against
it's going against the Fire tablet
that's one of the latest versions
I don't know if like me
there are front and rear cameras
now there is a multitasking button
you can change it to others
Google's a quick draw web app
this just runs in a website

i'm not being paid by lenovo
i'm not being sponsored by lenovo
lenovo is not getting copy approval

the pen and keyboard are included
it uses one quadruple a battery
taking a look at the keyboard
it also has a precision touchpad
it does get bright at 390
nits has really good black points
well you're looking at 92 srgb
i love the included excellent keyboard
i really liked it a lot
it's got the magnesium alloy chassis
let me know how i'm doing
1/8 gen intel core i5 processor
you'll get slightly better battery life
a bit light for me personally
but that's offset by the overall
do make this tablet stand out
keys is a form over function
what makes this tablet shine installing
the tablet also boasts android support
thank you so much for watching
hi everyone this is teo from

Park Blocks calm in today's video
I'm going to review there's tablet
so the highlight of this tablet
so let's take a look inside

we have another camera as well
this tablet is a bit thick
the resolution is 1280 by 800
I'm going to use sketchbook since
I was actually resting my palm
you see all these dots here
to draw with compared to sketchbook
I think this would be perfect
and those are much more expensive
I hope this video is helpful
might sound like a big amount
model that run into the thousands
so this tablet is pretty big
I was touching on the screen
let's read the back of it
but here's all of the wording
this has already been cut open
i didn't is it that big

c and one micro usb adapter
the pen is not heavy enough
i believe you will find it
it's a very cool looking software
tablet it's about 50 on amazon
pablo nino's m has different colors
it was heavy it was bulky
it provides a fairly decent performance
you've nothing to maybe worry about
I personally recommend the Amazon fire
screw your conventional review video methods
we do things different around here
that's larger than most phone screens
on the back of the tablet
you will be given four screws
it saved me all the time
this may all be slightly confusing
export tablet configurations and import ones
I hope you all enjoyed that

that does everything and they've used
this used eight to calibrate it
it was giving me smooth lines
it's just those couple of things
now you can see the screen
it didn't bother me too much

I got a bunch of replacement
I personally love using this now
but there you have it guys
that's my review of the way
this is a place for reviews
let's open it up first now
this came from china from books
and then we have a books
typical books cover which i believe
please put that on the factory
i would pay extra for that
i do not like book styluses
we're going to do two things
it's gonna even gonna feel more
i just don't see that's gray
let's make it a little thicker
it's ghosting when i push this
just don't do anything for me
it's it's just ghosting and i
let me go back to normal
let me refresh the whole thing
i mean it's it's it's decent
i don't think i'd use it
looks like it's going on ebay
the ghosting is not that great
obviously not a super thin tablet
this is an active digitizer pen
this pen is not a capacitive
generally speaking slots are covered here
that means you can use keyboards
Lenovo zone app shop over here
Lenovo is trying to sell this
that kind of stuff is here
so say you want to edit
are you going to toggle keyboard
Lenovo has a really cool accessory
that's playing 360p inside the browser
we have a 1080p high profile
stylus that does two different things
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
this is hack the planet today
you're gonna find cheap plastic here
the screen of course is plastic
should you get it or not
you can't find any other deals
you shouldn't have any problem there
let's take a look at those
it's not a really well-built keyboard
so let's get this one unboxed
oh my god it's so big
thank god i appreciate that okay
let's see what we have here
22 plus is actually 21.5 inches
but it feels huge to me
i tried walking with it okay
the colors aren't as accurate anymore
i can't complain about the colors
hope you liked this little review
see you on the next video
hot rubber grip two side buttons
it feels really comfortable to hope
this is not a wireless tablet
it's really thin on the back
the big 40 is very solid
is this extra Windows Inc functionality
Pro really bang paint and creat
they don't wobble basically the lines
I expect them to the performance
another issue with photoshop is pressure
the pennant does not support sensitivity
there's no need to buy this
I hope this video is helpful
this is called the innovator 16.
they're very pressure sensitive and whatnot
please leave them in the comments

let me say go to that
he also has a boo in
model numbers p 0 to 8
thank you for watching my video
i've seen your comments your requests
kind of feels a little flimsy
it's only about nine millimeters thick
the pen itself is also interesting
wires would have to go down
it's a little hard to describe
it has a very soft grip
so is this a good buy
that does it for this review
well there's the 8.2 for you
and that means that things are
Motorola you plug something in sound
10.1 comes with an active digitizer
not a capacitive teton in fact

that'll check out the web browser
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
this tablet has 11 different buttons
I generally really like this tablet
this is a budget price tablet
it does have a front camera
it shouldn't be that bad now
you have all that control there
this next one is the first
it has really good pen pressure
there's a power button on it
it's kind of a small detail
thank you so much to them
but yeah that mushy stuff aside
it's the CV 720 ug tablet
have you know they felt like
is you know a budget tablet
I'm holding a camera right now
I can't really show you that
I can't promise it'll do it
I don't know who to believe
I really appreciate you stopping by
grown-ups tablet is the wrong word
i think is really really reasonable
i had both tablets set up
this isn't free-for-all youtube on here
they've done really well with it
so it's an eight inch screen
um it fills up quite fast
they're robust they're really reasonably priced
thanks so much for watching bye
I found it for around 80
I'm gonna flip this guy over
let's see what else we've got
the screen is nice and bright
it's already included on the system
I hope you enjoyed this review
you can see the unlock button
Hodel this is the Acer Iconia
I do enjoy the front-facing speakers
so that's one the first thing
I'm not doing any hardcore gaming
there's some other options in here
who are interested in the benchmark
graphics look really good one complaint
I have about the tablet is
the camera doesn't seem very good
smaller tablet does get scaled smaller
anything like that comics magazines so
Dollar Tree in the electronics department
if you are a die-hard gamer
maybe getting into the 1080 1080

here's a link to another video
Jazza is proudly sponsored by Adobe
okay so about two weeks ago

I didn't have to pay anything
I think it works pretty good
those are the specs on it
this might be one of them
are your stereo speakers like that
i just want to tell you
i've already had it boot up
i happen to like this one
there's nothing really special about it
that stands out it works well
it feels nice in the hand
quality is okay for a tablet
they've become innocuous and ubiquitous devices
we'll see you next time bye
it's a whole lot of fun
we're gonna unbox it first here
let's check it out alright so
which even bad lines you know
I hope you enjoyed this video

and there are four replacement tips
there is this cloth pen holder
I have no issues with Photoshop

Krita pressure works here very nicely
I have tested especially in Photoshop
I'm very impressed with the box
I'm glad they give you that
actually so don't worry about that
the glove doesn't fit me perfectly
what the wheel does all this
I again a few little gripes
we might do some drawing together
I will explain in a minute
so there's no problem doing that
I'll grab my piece of paper

so that's the light part okay
I give it two thumbs up
iPad a really great screen resolution

comparisons on a basic surface level.

That's contrast between warmth and cool.

the picture quality is definitely decent
they're not going to be spectacular
another good thing about this tablet
it's still pretty nice and crisp
keep purchasing products to do reviews
they had the google pixel slate
it is made out of plastic
so it's a little more flimsy
gigahertz has eight cores eight threads
that can do that for you
it's nice to have the keys

the buttons are made from metal
gigs forty-six gigs is allocated to
the battery was slightly better on
let me know in the comments
don't forget to like and subscribe
um the door access control here
and it's also running the fire
you have a MediaTek 8163 CPU
they give it a fail unique
gigs that comes with this device
I mean in terms of benchmarks
it looks pretty good from others
they have to have a password
hold on let me go back
thank you for watching my video
i'm still not perfect at it
that's my version of zooming in
there's a wider variety of brushes
it is an affordable graphic tablet
this is a pretty old tablet
you can tuck the buckle underneath
but we ain't gonna do that
we like that mini HDMI port
this is a very well specs
you don't tend to find many
i think something like that come
yes we can this android market
tends to be a bit weird
it's around the 600 megahertz processor
so that's that now let's try
sound all of sound but look
Yan Liu Yan that Chinese symbol
is this tip of the pen
they are all the same kind
this is my fifth fifth temple
you mean you know you know
I mean you could switch it
but that's just a personal thing
so yeah just a heads up
also the size of the tablet
the size is actually pretty nice
so it's not really a problem
centric tablet launched by meters and
we hope you liked this video
insured it's cheap and like tablet
touch a company to be honest
i've not really heard of before
all that means is the software
but you'll definitely notice some choppiness
it plays smoothly without any issues
it does a pretty good job
they're very dark and lack detail
let's not be around the bush
and i could have tolerated that
everything you need it to do
there is also no instruction manual
it has an amazing airplane graphic
let's break into this massive debate
answer this it's just personal preference
self-taught and graphic design self-taught photography
you is from an audio standpoint
ever to use a trackball mouse
it does not need any batteries
went back to using the keyboard
yet we settle for substandard mouse
i didn't like it at all
it's as intense as an artist
it's not an entry-level graphics tablet
and it's still dark isn't it
you're gonna shading now aren't you
yeah because you were saying to
sure can pupster do your worst
Marshall can you press chases Chuck
oh he is there oh nice
I was gonna go to London
actually we've got mini HDMI port
the quality is not very good
it doesn't take very good pictures
they're pretty much black and white
the app drawer loads pretty smoothly
it is a pretty good processor
they have a lot of apps
I did here with Google Maps
well one thing with the mini
it's not a bad budget tablet
check out the e-book reader com
but yeah like so first impressions
which is that's quite a lot
somebody on the other unboxing video
don't want your tablet sliding around
i'm happy with all little things
um the default settings were fine
download the drivers from the website
this is the 10.1 inch version
you also get three months of
we also get our user manual
non pro versions for the cpu
they're usually shipping with two gigs
both of them are really bad
Disney Plus now keep in mind
just to give you a look
Pub G is really well optimized
let's take a look at some
2019 has more power than this
Amazon fire OS which is something
Plus and Netflix ready to go
but that's it for this one
I still remember when Isaac eat
i'll show you how that works
it supports tilt on the stylus
this is not a standalone tablet
react to me using the dial
this was one of the tests
i've had and that's free now
it wasn't really necessary at all
it might be a bit different
they continue to use these diaries
here's the cool thing about it
publish all this stuff in there
you can go to the normal
SC you can just unlock it
unlock it and earn extra time
it just feels kind of weird
uh what i needed to do
um the pressure levels work great
you can do that or just
use it as a mouse personally
two great price and great quality
this guy also has two cameras
so we have the lock button
a good thing about that is
and i think that's very important
i left this on my desk
this has a ton of things
I have here an Twilight blue
unfortunately they didn't add any more
same thing with 3d mark here
this is actually the first time
I also tried the lite version
I'm gonna test here is minecraft
we'll move over to YouTube now
now if you want to install
mario 64 as you see here
expect this to go down on
I created on the fire 8
which is a really good price
I like that there you go
same quality picture quality as well
is the main boy over here
this is what it looks like
what's not so good about this
the text is really not sharp
so that's the live TV app
they're serving from their front page
which gives you full control over
so you can check it out
so that's pretty good it also
it also has storage 20 already
used up without even downloading anything
thank you for watching my video
um i don't know about selfies
those aren't as big right now
this is a $99 tablet from
now let's look at the screen

it's pretty much filled with everything
I didn't have it set up
there let's go back into it
please subscribe rate and check back
ETA prime back here again today
it's just not a well known
8 megapixel front and it's running
right hand corner you can see
comm they are a great service
there's no windows or anything here
so not all that heavy here
so here's the silicon case which
I thought the tablet was I
it's got a nice form factor
USB port also a separate power
it's still a pretty reflective screen
once you get it turned on
so let me pull it up
it's a very simplistic art program
so let's talk about some specs
the tablet will not function on
plate is made of brushed aluminium
you would find on your phone
these will not respond to touch
you want a sharp picture too
they have improved it you know
UI it's also a lot faster
Amazon has plenty of cloud services
I don't have to do that
Ridge you can feel it now
you can really feel them however
Evan you plug in the cable
we'll take a look at that
we do have parental controls here
reading books are using certain applications
Amazon goes for kind of wider
that battery is sealed inside here
it's pretty cool this time usually
Wi-Fi only is going to cost
I've side loaded all of those
and how do you do that
you can go ahead and read
I also have a Kindle paperwhite
sharp text the super-high resolution IPS
there lit up right now because
yeah they know about a shortcut
the whole nine yards looking great
and who is this device for
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review

looks like a very sturdy construction
this is just how it is
god bless and stay fantastic everyone

5.0 it has a 5 gigahertz
so here is the tablet itself
it doesn't feel like it's cheap
so here is the tablet itself

one over here one over here
it's really not bad at all
see the tablet in brighter environments
It Yourself depending on your situation
the tablet also isn't super thick
it's really not that much thicker
I want to buy the tablet
we make out what that says
we are on a web page
the video is definitely pretty sharp
the battery lasts quite some time
nobody wants to see that anyhow
HVAC unit here and your switches
I don't know what that is
let's go through the features here
those can bus information is static
wait for it by the way
don't consult any gun to console
anyway guys you're getting the idea
I mean would you use it

I was looking forward to this
extension cables a nice addition glove
unfortunately didn't really paid out too
I'll see you guys next time

so it comes quite unique box
I'm a couple of other things
it's not really a huge drawback
I'm going to do is this

let's see if it has video
doesn't like there's a music player
Prime inside our YouTube video description
and we'll see you next time

this actually came two days ago
we live in a simple life
we stopped by at the restaurant
i actually stopped by the restaurant
they are actually looking for me
i don't know how to read
maybe you want to silence that
it's going to silence the notification
another thing you can do on
so what i did was downloaded
is these the this gestures option
another thing that's cool is multitasking
hold the youtube with your finger
you're going to get split screen
just pay the extra for 50
it's going to be password protected
is the indicator light for notifications
we have a little user manual
unfortunately they're both at the bottom
the screen does look really good
i mean you're recording in 480p
well i mean for the price
Christmas is coming one of these
so hopefully you can read this
the screen is a hot rod.
You can navigate using Samsung style
Until next time, thanks for watching

this is actually a wireless tablet
the build quality is quite solid
there are six physical shortcut buttons
let's take out the USB receiver
I have already installed the driver
it seems that drawing at 100%
I get a slight jito now
I like to use zoom in
so it's not really a problem
I seldom draw at 100% zoom
pressure does not work by default
the build quality is quite good
so that's all for today's review
Oh today is a special day
look two videos in one week
it's time for a new one
I'm not used to the single
okay wonder what it could be
I cannot wait to open this
I feel like tape or something
that's like keeping this together that
oh no it's got a smelter
there's a tiny globe all right
oh but it's spandex it stretches
I am a professional artist now
I have I have a glove
they even pack candy in here
flimsy feels a little bit light
let's start drawing voiceover time awesome
okay first off a little background
this is probably going super fast
this is my first display that
I'm drawing on so I don't
it was very easy to do
I've been doing all these years
so it's already quite a bit
I'm gonna get back in first
and it's very easy to install
just watch how i do you
I was sent this by Vaughn
I want to see too often
I review here on the channel
I do actually read the comments
so here's the pros and cons
this tablet is very thin which
what's really nice about it is
a big shout out to van
you will find the power button
also the tablet has 2 cameras
it has a front facing camera
let's check out some gameplay now
I've been playing a little bit
I know a lot of us
this video is sponsored by galman

we became good friends by them
i didn't want to do that
i kept doing that for months
I'm back with another video today

it's touch sensitive as well so
I have a quick radial menu
you know different brush capacities that
I hope you enjoyed this video
Oh what is up my peepholes

should you prefer it a helpful
I use their motion computing f5
spare car chargers car battery chargers
you can see my hands here

spend maybe 70 80 bucks more
but yeah leave me many comments
we'll see you all next time
it works great on your lap
the design is kind of nice
you can play games on it
strong magnets are detached the screen
recently err and you can see
it's the picture looks pretty small
I just happen to have this
it almost is a velvety surface
so that's a look at the
i'll be reviewing this android tablet
and this is the m6 model
i don't can't even open this
you can actually take this off
i've managed to open it now
but it's lightweight it's pretty cool
I'm gonna take dr. white there
I think this is pretty cool
we thought it was pretty cool
see you in the next video
yes that's it and good luck
let's start with the tablet specifications
i used this with the program
all of a sudden this'll move
oh my god is that it
i'll give a list style summary
would i use this tablet personally
the keyboard pins the keyboard case
there's a workaround for this issue
charger didn't really accelerate this procedure
I won't actually be fixing stuff
point for OS a one together
I have just one down there
so what do we have here
guide is probably very very useful
we know what these things do
what we have here okay well
so it's actually very very standard
Joby let's have a look nice
good for a forty seven quid
let's see what we've got here
choose some apps to add nap
come on come back into focus
I didn't actually move the camera
what i did do was go
no idea that you're shopping download
we not going too fast here
and welcome to google play music

crash noodle cake games yellow monkey

i'm lisa from mobile tech review
would you like to see the
I've no idea what that says
not a lot is the answer
we shall get back to that
nothing on the back except some
it's like an awkward child brother
will it get it yay there
I'm going to search for something
well the screen itself is capacitive
obviously and is very very nice
it's a very precise feels solid
why don't we check manage please
Inc there we are yes indeed
look it looks like an old
that's a bit of a problem
576 and it seems to play
what comes after specifications battery life
isn't that round in real life
I want if I can go
I won't find out till playback
what a pointless experiment anyway here
I don't know if this is
it's fairly nippy as these things
get on with it nearly there
they keep for that express purpose
it's like smaller screen slightly smaller
is that going to improve massively
what do you need it for
I wouldn't recommend getting one really
stand just sitting there like that
this is a very slim box
some general information these are specification
I'm gonna try to out later
it has a very smooth surface
okay this is a new design
this is quite good so actually
put this here like this it
ok if you are left-handed user
you can check this box here
I'm going to pick a brush
let me zoom in for you
probably that is closer to a
other software they do not have
they have their brush to that
also can use pen pressure so
this is a very nice software
let me try some quick hatching
Pro is a free drawing application
this tablet looks fine on sketchbook
that's all for my review today
At the top of the screen
it won't run on cellular networks.
For video recording, the headphone jack
also doubles as a microphone input!
This is because the official Max
Y-splitter but It's wired differently internally.
I think that the DragonTouch Max

I have on my other tablets
I'm very impressed with this tablet
but it's not a bad thing
I want to point out this
let's just leave it at that
moving away from the screen again
pretty much will just bring up
there's your microphone by the way

pin notice probably does pin notice
but we don't want to so

Wacom pen as you can see
the style is very very similar
I needed the USB to see
it's been a long time coin
it's not as jittery so my
oh that this is very smooth
I can't draw straight lines anyway
so this seems oh very smooth
I'm kind of like leave it
that kind of works the best
it's very very nice like it

this office is such a mess
what is it that you do
it's just a very repetitive task
well i did i hid it
okay it's now 25 to six
we would open my peel box
i was sent this lovely package
um but how funny is that
i'm so sorry um so these
obviously her shop is closed now
um let me get her details
um so abby of anathar anathar
thank you so much for watching
i will see you very soon
i lower the opacity of it
i'm not the best at it
this one has 10 customizable keys
iv present buttons here and there
it's a package from chiana time
i did some quick recording outside
okay so i'm giving quick demonstration
and let's see with the display
the same goes for the ram
that is running on the backhand
so let's take a close look
nothing else much on the box
so you get a bluetooth keyboard
the front camera is 5 megapixels
the display quite fingerprint heavy norm
just put that to one side
i move the box out though
i have downloaded a few apps
say that fits in really nice
i'll see you next time you
I'm finally doing a tablet review
it's pretty damn nice to use
who wants to get into tablets
I think that makes sense okay
well that about wraps things up
this is a pretty cool feature
and what makes it so spiffy
I really like the highlighter function
the highlighter function is very important
I think this is pretty amazing
I think this is pretty amazing
but it's in the wrong place
it's a huge upgrade from 1.8
I hope this has been helpful
get real high and fun days
and this one's actually quite nice
it's got a really nice rigid
feel to it feels very solid
the screen actually looks quite nice
it kind of minds me of
I do like it a lot
we get the different font choices
book early is the new default
I forgot to mention it earlier
they don't get muffled easily tone
everything's nice and bright and clear
it's got good strong viewing angles
it actually seems to work good
they may seem quite good there
it's about 100 pounds on Amazon
then what the ones in the
it's a little lock on it
I didn't use them very much
I had where it would know
the the presentation is really nice
it feels well packaged and like
Wacom stop and range I personally
I think it was an Amazon
it also comes with the latest
we have a third-party ten inch
it also has a quad-core processor
we highly recommend the matric kanji
now this is another third-party tablet
this is all that you need
it weighs less than a pound
it's tiny the built-in IR blaster
free for software installation on here
so that is a good thing
looks like it's packaged pretty nicely
nice it's in clear plastic film
it feels like decent enough plastic
these gloves can be super useful
there's your pen nibs right there
it's definitely a comfortable shape pen
I'd have to say pretty cool
so let's put that back in
we go peel all that off
that's a function that usually only
see how that feels and like
the pen doesn't use a battery
you don't have to charge it
but we'll play around with them
which is my favorite drawing program
it looks awesome like the display
I'm not a huge color expert
it works right off the bat
this was really easy to install
Oh you can also have it
I'm not sure what that does
I usually set my second mouse
I right-click in the corner here
it looks so good display settings
advance one frame turn it left
that's everything in the driver overall
it's a bit sticky parallax wise
it feels pretty on the nose
it's not drawing at all oh
I think that's gonna do it
I have no issues with it
I don't think it's that fragile
it's a bit kind of sticky
I'll catch you guys next time
It's easy to get light pressure.
Now let's talk about the stand.
the back side of my phone
sometimes we're going to mute okay
whisper shirt actually is pretty cool
that's most comfortable for my camera
this is the new Cintiq 16
it is a pen display basically
Wacom is my personal gold standard
I'm using a really wide brush
I've set it in other videos
I'm really bad at judging color
this comes with a combo cable
I'm looking in the Box now
oh look there are extra nibs
there tucked away behind this little
it was super easy to setup
I'm a big fan of it
hello everyone in this week's video
nibs and there are more pen
nibs hiding with the pen stand
i do think it'd be nice
i got from a previous tablet
i do want to mention that
i hope i'm saying it right
this is kind of a i
i use does the same thing
and then i toned it down
they didn't give me any issues
vk 1200 is 249.99 on amazon
the tablet is much more portable
i'm not giving it a full
it's the perfect amount of texture
not too much not too little
I have a dual monitor setup
it's probably one of those things
this gets a little confusing so
welcome to the little brothers channel
there's a tablet and a pen
that's the wall it is opening
calendar sound recorder chrome clock camera
i have defeated him so much
it has front and back camera
this is a pretty safe choice
this is the same as the
let's go over kind of the
what you have to actually do
that's how you'll use this browser
the question for most people is
have probably sound a lot better
Android device to give them that
you're not spending too much money
I hope this video helped you
so let's get onto the review
it was sitting out right here
man this tablet we dope maybe
it's gonna pop up some numbers
let me play some music again
we're gonna go to bluetooth music
got the quick apps right here
I'll show you all about that
I don't want to sign stop
I don't want to sign in
okay now leave me alone okay
it is outside in my cases
you gotta have a satellite yeah
I just put this right here
Huyen tablet while doing these sketches
there are so many buttons that
tool undo redo and flip canvas
where it shows you if your
I was surprised to look up
I tried to find a comparable
I guess the technology is different
the pros absolutely outweigh the cons
I think it works pretty well
it's gonna be a huge bottleneck
and we are finally online now
it may disconnect at any point
Rhyno burning at 720p lowest settings
and what do you know the
nothing is going through so so
Ethernet cable and we'll talk about
lastly performance forward the CPU is
I recommend this tablet definitely not
I probably don't recommend getting it
Hi this is Travis with POSGuys.com.
cintiq 22 inch hd touch and
i know that they have some
xp pen is the build quality
there's not a lot of fanciness
which is the next connection here
it's got this rubber grip here
you got the rocker button here
there's the stylus nice and safe
that's it for me you guys
you'll find the dual speaker setup
I found no reason to fault
Sony's very stylized take on Android
Samsung does put into its tablets
you really do have something special
No. Am I doing one anyway?
What a dumb fool I was.
The monitor arm changed my life.
Digital keyboards, blech. Touch function, blech.
The 24 Pro doesn’t do that.
I turn it on. It works.
Magic. The magical tech support trick.
speeds in display settings > advanced.
I’m always hoping for a driver
low battery warning for no reason.
I always suspect the driver issues.
Fresh installs, rekeying shortcuts by hand
I tried one of the pens
I thought that would be cool.
The 27QHD is a quiet T-rex.
I think it's a fennec fox
here's the usual comparison with my
I don't know what that's for
but this one felt pretty solid
I hope you enjoyed the video
and so they said to hate
it seems to work pretty well
I don't know so right now
I also forgot to mention that
I asked you guys on Twitter
why would I draw it again
so that's what we're gonna do
Steven universe has an afro right
mmm that's some good stomach thing
do you need any more convincing
do you need any more convincing
I'm not sure about price range
I want to turn it over
I lighten my second sketch layer
this tablet has been really good
trying to figure out you know
my lines were kind of constricted
this is your skin skin skin
this is her skin and it
but sometimes like right here sometimes
I think it did pretty fantastic
it's a really good entry option
this is a really nice tablet
I notice no lag at all
maybe a newer one would work
they just a slightly different size
just nice to have so again
because it's just a really beefy
there's a good feel to it
there's barely a flange on it
clicky feeling it's it feels cheap
it's just a different feeling so
I did with the top button
then you have a different pressure
I kind of paint that in
it's like this bottom button here
so wherever you put your pen
I don't think it really matters
one as 620 graphics tablet pad
I thought this was pretty cool
this is a battery for you
I hit the right click option
what kind of options so yeah
they seem to really like it
yeah on a sketch like this
who merely wants to use it
i highly recommend the latter keyboard
cover that is priced at 199
I got this nice little pouch
it's got the buttons on it
would you like to save it
probably not gonna do it again
maybe I got like three hours
Sebastian here from noble fugu studio
let's see what the artist 12
you're going to invest in either
it's a good size its handheld
so you can split it up
I just hold it like this
I said I really like that
I'm saying so basically it works
we're doing something a little different
why not they were kind enough
so this tablet does it draw
i mean it is a tablet
is it two of them it
I don't do that right now
I'm not even in the picture
you can not close this up
I can do it with one
we love this for at home
they drop things all the time
she found it easy to navigate
the buttons on screen are big
they're pretty good upon initial setup
the first year is completely free
now it's not a super impressive
CPU BAU elaborate more on that
megapixel which is 640 by 480
this guy was very very easy
come in and stuff like that
it was very very hard like
what what can you know the
yes absolutely because of the screen
check this out is the new
hey don't feel bad little guy
there are preset settings for this
I think that about covers it
it's light easy to move around
you have to buy it extra
I'm drawing this inktober illustration that
this is a battery free pen
it has 8,192 levels of pressure
let's go to the drawing test
it's not really a hot spot
let me go back on that
let's clean that up right now
i will only be showing you
but let's get into this review
okay check it out all right
let me do it this way
let me do it this way
we'll get it out of here
hold on okay here we go
there's nothing wrong with that okay
i think this is the pin
okay let's set this up here
i think i got it off
oh my god laptop anything man
oh man just for another little
you understand what this is okay
you need man 20 inch canvas
somebody should left that on there
so i'll know the next time
let me come back over here
this is not a regular pen
it's a special pen you know
yeah this is a good device
i don't know i know quality
here let me open this up
let's see what we got here
okay now we got the screws
i said your computer or anything
i was running with the cruiser
don't perform that great they're acceptable
I've been testing works absolutely fine
it's a very very good performance
inch screen here with that full
this is well worth checking out
thank you very much for watching
Hello again and welcome to yet
So stay tuned that’s up next.
Give this video the thumbs up
it's my first time doing one
okay sorry for all that exposition
there's actually a matte screen protector
uh so it's up to you
they make a pretty satisfying clicking
there's a power cord in hdmi
the driver was actually pretty easy
you can actually open this tab
I still don't like the background
we'll never use the pen now
that's how big it was so
I don't have to charge it
I could make reviews more interesting
let's look at the device itself
stylus is definitely a huge plus
let me know in the comments
these come in at 150 dollars
now this is a low-end cpu
2 this is a dual core
I said in my last video
beat them all out once again
there are cheaper phones out there
GPU benchmark was ice storm again
the tablet fits right in here
it performs well especially with that
but it was still very laggy
your app of choice is here's
campus pro 12 drawing tablet now
this drawing tablet is really good
I use for this tablet personally
which makes it super smooth like
LPI and 10 millimeter reading height
this also has two programmable buttons
that's how I like it no
it's on whatever default it is
you have your keys and hotkeys
going back to the tablet settings
I recommend going into screen ratios
those really crude close-ups in spongebob
I'm still not used to well
I don't even draw the eyebrows
it's that's how tired I am
you know rough drawings and whatnot
I'd say that's still pretty portable
you're good to go so whoa
what's my verdict on this tablet
has this touch sensitive unusual keyboard
it's a backlit keyboard below it
now that's not really Dells fault
the display is difficult to read
them sound is average and muted
i took from the two cameras
the camera app is not intuitive
10 is a worthy android tablet
leave your comments and discuss below
you have a jack for headphones
we already seen on the box
you got a 1.5 gigahertz processor
I did the slingshot benchmark test
that's that's pretty cool 19 degrees
actually it's just slow it works
well just slow um all right
nice little interface watch now trailer
it runs rather rather good you
yeah it's it's it's done me
you've got documents you can do
there's lots to do on there
you know it's great for kids
and i've found um i found
uh for this first product review
i'll catch you guys next time
you have this little removable tab
it answered my question for me
it is friday july 24th 2020.
we use it every single year
guys display is very clear actually
i have also downloaded several apps
but let's give this a try
looks like i did okay there
let's go to the next one
i think i just killed somebody
i died just like that okay
this game is pretty fun guys
come on shoot him shoot him
oh wow i actually killed somebody
oh oh what's going on here
i'm horrible with games as well
these games haven't been changed much
these games have not changed much
i'm so excited to unbox this
first of all thanks to hun
let's unbox this little guy here
we will remove the plastic later
there's a leaflet here printed separately
I've got a couple of educational
I think that's a great option
it's it's amazing where you get
we have a new device here
today we are unboxing this device
let's look at some specifications here
the packaging looks like some cheap
we have very fairly stock android
yeah it's the maximum sound here
i can almost play the game
okay fine we are back now
we go for quadrant standards benchmark
we have very laggy screen here
okay have a good time friends
great sound and great for connectivity
up to hundred twenty eight gigabytes
this is a hexa core processor
headphone jack to use with this
it'll start off with the video
this is definitely kind of work
this little basically splendid display app
which will last you extremely long
this is again a nine point
I think with full screen applications
you'll want to use the included
it's nice to have the option
it's about a thirty dollar accessory
but it's not my favorite accessory
I really like the folio case
let's take a look at whoops
it gives the option to almost
what does that mean no idea
it actually looks like a trackpad
this may seem a bit pixelated
I think it works pretty well
it's also quite smooth and now
so the quick strokes look fine
work for photo and video editing
they all work very well so
we have a lot of numbers
so it's very comfortable very easy
wow do be hey bye bye
thank you very much for watching
what's else in the box itself
the device itself costs 70 power
or above right off the bat
there's still some weight to it
i love drawing gloves so much
this tablet's pen pressure is insane
it didn't work like at all
what i'm drawing with this tablet
they can be pretty loud though
it was just clip studio paint
this tablet doesn't do the whole
good afternoon people of the internet
welcome back to Margaret baking and

pouching eight mirrors a drone also

ETA prime back here again today
this is a single speaker setup
there's three Walmart apps I think
this is the single core score
they're on par with each other
fine here's Minecraft Pocket Edition now
it runs pretty good on here
don't expect this device to run
you can see what just happened
the stand is not very good
I can't knock it that much
I'm not a fan of that
it's a fine little graphics tablet
this tablet is a very affordable
one it is only 239 dollars
all right here is the moment
we have the pen the pen
it is the pen display scent
we have the quick start guide
it's actually a good size cloth
let's look at this tablet stand
so i'm just gonna see guess
obviously so we've already seen this
so everything's starting to come together
let's finally look at the tablet
is this usbc to usbc cable
i was very impressed with that
which is something you of course
it was quite intuitive right away
you know i was so surprised
Pro is a much better deal.
The bottom serves as a stand.
Here is everything in the box.
The screen itself has a finish
Set scale and layout to 100%.
A screen appears on your tablet.
Click the center of the red
shortcut buttons and customize pen pressure.
The tablet worked in every program
Of course the lines aren’t perfect.
Restarting the computer fixed the problem.
Just click the “Product Reviews” button.
character renderings on the front some
stand a dust cloth and all-in-one
I did also have a cheeky
where kids need to be entertained
it certainly did do the job
Bosto store on their Aliexpress website
well done so a great big
what's going on everyone this is
I'm sure as time goes on
the display on here is 1080p
so you can put a micro
it's really up to you now
performance is very good as well
and that's not a problem either
that will work call duty mobile
I don't like I like that
sup cuties your favorite chocolate drink
let's get back to the tablet
alright this is what you get
i think there are no stickers
now that i think about it
well that's pretty much it now
here i can draw pretty comfortable
um so yeah that is nice
i don't wanna sit here forever
that's a personal favorite of mine
it's a shortcut for undo because
you open it up and inside
you just go to the the
I like drawing on the screen
it is for most digital artists
this is the first time where
so if you click and click
and that's me this is me
hey guys welcome to digit dot
PPI it isn't the Christmas display
so there you have it guys
that was our review of this
expanded storage in our internal storage
I like is the fingerprint scanner
no, this one's for the audience.
Okay, let's just get into it
Wow, I'm such a masculine man.
What? I just found this out.
Zoom in, see how it looks.
How smooth is the response rate?
And this one is pretty nice.
You guys can see that, right?
You remember this thing right here?
It's supposed to come o- woah!
And now your nib is replaced.
And three, lots of fresh underwear.
I hope you enjoyed the review.
oh and also they lay eggs
congratulations babies they fighting again recently
I know this stuff pen pen
that helps the helps remove this
I don't really count the inches
I suffer for this nice okay
I need to check it out
the test works the brush strokes
oh it works beautifully it's beautiful
I tried is the small tablet
look this one the new version
I really like is the driver
that won't change none at all
okay add color right like this
Oh out of so many tablet
the tablet has a screen protector
but that's it for this one
it's the end of the video
Today, we're doing a Tablet review.
Without further ado, let's do it.
The stand that comes with it.
Ooooo, check how shiny it is!
I'm just gonna take it off.
So I have this painting here
I really like to go in
It looks pretty good on screen.
I think that's kind of funny.
This is not a mobile computer.
And of course, there's a giveaway!
Any last words you wanna say?
I haven't bought anything from gearbest
they've just sent this to me
it's worked well in all programs
the build quality seems quite good
some people have talked about pen
I don't notice a massive difference
I really like the big screen
they are that little bit better
that it's 10-inch yes from browsing
thanks to the large screen size
we talked a little about this
i'm going to review the gaomon
it's priced around you as 70
this is for holding the pen
there are five above the touch
the driver for mac and windows
i'm just using the default mapping
i have with the mango s
it's very accurate overall drunk experience
if you're using photoshop for example
I think is the best buy
the pen is working really well
Full HD 1080p rear facing webcam
this full-size backlit and spill resistant
this has none of those issues
button here to load up your
it's got the full version of
slot for a micro SD card
you have the speaker output speakers
so that's probably his biggest limitation
there are two cameras on here
I'll pull up the stats bernhard
it comes in much slower and
we looked at just last week
trackpad attached this thing is from
sometimes it does a little better
and what's nice about this too
hey the pen supports the industry
erasers top as erasers at all.
the pen holder holds the pen
the light-handed pressure strokes came out
tablet for free it is optional
that's all for today MuBot out.
so this is the $79 version
it's actually a pretty nice tablet
gigahertz processor it is pretty zippy
it is pretty smooth to operate
this is a 16 gigabyte model
got all their stuff on here
they have a good selection apps
you got some different font choices
what do we talked about display
I kept fluctuating all the time
Vantage's for those with vision problems
capacity 6 thousand milliamps an hour
let's have a look what's inside
yeah basically just the charger here
you guys can see the specs
there's this theme removal tool remember
aluminium finish tecla's size is metal
and straight out of the box
here you have the night light
we can see the eight cores
this one is not google certified
let's try pubg mobile the graphics
have a look smooth medium classic
I think it's nice and thin
so maybe there's that bit faster
I didn't notice any squiggling lines
I don't notice much between them
the drivers work without any problems
the programmer the buttons were good
well done with the graphics tablet
the best budget tablet is here
it has a fully laminated gorilla
but what else do we have
it's very slow to charge this
i will be testing it out
which is great considering the price
they're not high quality loud speakers
with okay average kind of quality
it is covered with gorilla glass
it's 16 by 10 aspect ratio
here too very smooth with this
i've got nova launcher installed here
cutting the costs not particularly fast
no starter no lag no problems
have the sim cards in there
good gamma and good touch response
it's the huawei mate pad pro
it's jc and a while ago
the packaging is super super nice
thank you for choosing me humon
there's my sanic i'm very proud
i didn't know it opened up
stand compared to my wacom pen
these styluses have been through worse
i didn't need to calibrate anything
that's also compatible with this tablet
thank you so much for watching
there's a button for that too
protector that's outlining all the specs
it's not actually out so unfortunately
the rear is autofocus eight megapixels
SIM door micro SD card type
it doesn't rattle anything like that
it has improved okay so multitasking
we're all a little bit choppy
I wanted to demonstrate to you
there's an application called screen filter
we're not seeing a warm white
ok jumping now onto the ROM
we're still seeing some of that
Android 10 on this tablet ever
we have a depth of brightness
ok not good so that means
HD ever probably on this tablet
they don't really care about that
I'll give you a sample here
see that actually sounds all right
this is a very large PDF
the performance is a lot better
it was up to 38 degrees
I was that initially standing right
yeah it's it's kind of great
the kickstand now has two positions
and that is soldered on board
there's a bunch of little tiny
that refers to this is rechargeable
though again you might have trouble
obviously this is a very thin
is your little ink pen pink
CPU but I rarely heard it
it's certainly a good pen experience
the performance is good on this
it's really runs quiet as well
metrics is keenly bright the keyboard
it is the drawback is just
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
display tablet the Galman pd 1161
this video is also a giveaway
there don't have a lemonade screen
I also have to say that
it's crazy and even if that
you don't need to spend more
I get mad over the Cintiq
you can get this on amazon
we have a thank you card
we have our sim ejector tool
we have some manuals here here
so here is the tablet itself
no lag here looks pretty good
don't really see any lag here
seems to be working pretty good
we are playing some asphalt graphics
it's definitely got a built quality
quality is definitely good battery life
I'm going to review the deco
and of course the drawing performance
this is not powered by battery
this part here is matte plastic
Windows is a very straightforward installation
you can just a pressure curve
this is quite convenient and now
let's test out the drawing performance
the drawing performance of this tablet
they work really well except for
let's check out the tooth sensitivity
3 with a really huge screen
the line quality you can get
hello everyone welcome to my channel
holder table has a decent weight
you need instructions on how to
this tablet uses a USB port
the pen has like over 300
I have my own PEM tablet
I'm showing you on the left
this was a bit jarring because
how this is turning out actually
I did forget to mention you
I think I'll get this tablet
Veeck or maybe it's pronounced VK
pop up over the last year
what on earth does that mean
it's very comfortable in the hand
the pen is also battery free
well fast hats lines do well
when you draw with a stroke
there that are in this category
and of course as always i
i've ranked these on my website
that's a little bit more expensive
hey guys so in today's video
I think of it so first
it didn't have that same problem
just as much as they like
Caesar and what did it become
you got a connect personal computer
the box comes with the display
the stand is thick and sturdy
I've used which are a few
they're really efficient on the site
I'm so old I am mature
maybe 8 gig or 16 gig
yeah we're on my own home
so this is a capacitive touchscreen
how does it work like this
I'm not very used to capacitive
let's go on another website here
so how fast is this then
this is just just a video
come back this in kind of
we can output this to HGTV
you can try some games later
I looks it's really thin huh
Coulomb let's quickly connect the HDMI
I go and switch to TV
this is better than the surface
the keys are also very good
so nothing much to say there
I didn't like about this kickstand
it's easy to lift ok now
you don't have much on top
details new accounts can be created
front and back cameras are included
4 le accelerometer and gyroscope extensors
Let’s go to where it says
the tablet wouldn’t detect the shortcuts
Oh, a wild Kai has appeared!
the pressure didn’t seem to work
The buttons for the shortcuts work
a allow freebies check that out
i'm sure that's on off switch
the working area is 10 inches
my final little struggle was that
Manute elements that you've drawn on
it's not just smudging the paper
I can tap on the race
Windows 10 experience on the device
it feels quite a robust tablet
it's really the web browsing here
now after checking out different tablets
it's called the tab light a
hit subset pileup out all right
so you have a charger keto
Apple the egg a GPU degenerate
I'm a scooper to a screen
Love Bug sorry art mmm Casbah
Kemal giveth a key Windows 10
Miltie so a both your cheese
it's not a garage de cachoeira
ever you say come too late
Wi-Fi speed up course my teacher
so zoom up course obsessive the
unibody has a build you have
you same pitch chica camera so
happy past no notification the center
so metal of garages are Barraza
a power type can operate command
receptor to sound a be hummus
videos didn't what was out there
the tablet itself has 8 hotkeys
that doesn't need to be recharged
Hansol hand to brush to erase
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room
SD card slot with the tab
I'm sure due to engineering constraints
it is still no slouch either
some games downloaded some more apps
I'm Jimmy wood Jim's review room
so let's take a look inside
shall we alright so first thing
and that's what's in the case
there's also a special edition tablet
Wacom pen tablet or even better
and if you'd like the shirt
this tablet can work with micro
we have camera actually kids desktop
I'm going to look for that
the processor type is quite cool
I hope that this was helpful
the latest on cortex a8 45
PMP with the Wi-Fi connection inside
let's go to and gadget type
it's actually readable in full full
yeah there's a list of like
so there's built in 16 gigs
some 3d games branches 3d games
it's 720p video that works alright
then we can see over here
CPU said quickly with three gigabyte
RAM with 3gb of ram 32
gigabyte storage on a 10 inch
no problem with this connection while
there is not much to see
the speakers are not the best
I want to do the job
okay so we get the idea
Riptide gp2 is not too bad
I start to struggle a bit
let me rest a little bit
there is a keyboard as well
you won't have any such problems
I had to press twice okay
alright thanks for watching bye bye
which is a 1 gigahertz processor
I yeah each to their own
oh my mail my my talk
I really think that you know
I think that with what's out
I'm not gonna say it's terrible
Let's get right into the unboxing.
The price is also quite high
I guess not about this huh
the rest of it is actually
it's just an observation big hands
I'm in a room right now
they shop in three two one
Chrome that was that was decent
oh actually already had that open
know the rest of the tablet
that's one of the reasons why
let's move on to a pub
I don't think fast charge actually
you don't need a great tablet
i'm going to review this graphics
some say that it's very good
let me show you the stand
this is a free drawing software
this is called sketches blue pro
I want em to be so
some of them do not work
I don't care wow I'm at
I'm number five on the board
I'm really excited to start this
thank you for buying that tablet
loads off next is the pen
some of the specs for this
I have to download the driver
and then just finding your device
it feels very flimsy to me
that's looking to get new tablet
it's also going to you know
the tabla is gonna be plug-and-play
they're almost all equal in size
AP 20 rechargeable pen just kidding
I really wanted to talk about
the rubber is actually pretty grippy
I don't know what happened there
this is my piece of paper
hey this is a tablet that
okay I'm gonna get going now
This is great news for artists
but it will do the trick.
The bezel design of the Wacom
The pen resolution is 2540 lpi.
perhaps for note taking or sketching.
device, you're going to need either
Now let's discuss installation and software.
The Wacom One sells for $399.
It comes with limited bundled software.
One is not a tablet computer.
so just how good is it
it is a super simple device
obviously you have the large 8.5
it's really easy to write on
the screen is press that button
there are definitely a few drawbacks
those are two pretty big drawbacks
I'll give you a quick example
I actually comes out really well
XP pan decals 0/3 wireless tablet
that was sent to me from
this cylindrical design is very simple
that's the remover and this here
feel to them and tip here
there are six physical shortcut buttons
the function key is actually this
let's test out the drawing functionality
this is Photoshop on the Mac
I think they'd hipper quite nicely
I had a very satisfactory experience
and the look so this is
there's no IDE option right now
but that's very rare one game
inch screen and the black bezels
it has a fully plastic body
so if you don't want that
I used for the 2017 version
it might vote your volunteer though
only but my wizard is theoretical
I can recommend comfortably right now
I love the rounded corners here
it's very comfortable to work with
there are eight physical shortcut buttons
this is a very thin tablet
looks really good for our us
it's more towards the lightweight side
which is something that I like
so these are the options available
more specifically for up and down
okay so these are the strokes
well see this giant cursor here
the lines they are very smooth
so here's another cartoon character that
I'm not sure why that happens
hello my name is Shannon Morris
tab 3 it cost 7 $29.99
this is a 10.1 inch tablet
it's less than an inch wide
Skype calls but other than that
there's micro HDMI a micro USB
and it has an Intel Atom
try or don't buy this item
it's very nice it's very fun
this is a very very affordable
that would be strange watching that
let's get rid of that one
the speakers are nice and clear
this was very very dark lighting
Alex thanks for tuning in live
let's jump right in alright guys
I will talk about the display
which you can per the back
we have the universal charging port
that's pretty much all you get
but this feels really really nice
this device features an mtk6592 processor
i would totally recommend this tablet
have a great day guys peace
they're not paying for this review
it's a very fast process here
the keyboard is also very nice
there is a backlight on here
your power switch is up here
USB port as a pen holder
I don't see any drop frames
that are not going to tax
is the ports on the side
how games work on this tablet
I'm testing how to testing out
this is the jumper easy pad
um than a tablet one thing
it's 1080p and at that resolution
they do work very very well
this is the same file -
I love how big it is
it's a bit challenging to you
great at 720p so me personally
Well, they stop sending you stuff.
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.
Repeat this process until everything works.
Product testing is a paid job.
Please share this with other artists
that is a white 16 gig
here there's a simple literature pack
there's really nothing to talk about
they're perfectly smooth on the bottom
some stylus optimized apps become available
lots of people prefer the stock
I actually kind of like it
these are the stock home screens
Android browser as you can see
Samsung is touting with the Galaxy
here's s note on this side
it is in an inactive state
Samsung's parts part of the reason
quick look at the samsung galaxy
two handles one on the left
I do like the controller cradle
hey what's up guys this is
let's go and set it up
this is a pretty good tablet
it's nice to looming them back
so it's a nice looking tablet
we'll compare them in a minute
it costs a lot of money
it's about 1 pound 12 ounces
so you've got that dual core
you can put bookmarks on here
that's on the internal storage area
I should mention that with Android
I've got Google books over here
you can change your font size
you can do that in fact
let's check out an email player
it's a very desktop like experience
but how much does that matter
you have your little little indicators
m89 definitely has a decent screen
I don't really care that much
there's really no problem with it
I'm not sure what's going on
asphalt has crashed which is annoying
I don't know why it crashes
it has 16 gigs of memory
that's more than half a kilo
the right side doesn't offer anything
in here i will be testing
it's just like an easter egg
some of these aren't yet done
i just carelessly put it down
i bought it on sale in
what's going on my name is
Kevin the tech ninja and today
we are reviewing another Lenovo product
Lenovo yoga tablet 2 8 inch
modes these modes are called stand
LCD display is full 1080p resolution
this device absolutely flies when gaming
UI skin on top of Android
the camera is a yoga tablet
you need to adjust your hand
make sure you like this video
this screen is 1280 by 800
I'm looking at it in here
it's got 16 gig of storage
you know these asa stuff which
what about watching video on it
let's just run the volume up
let's just go see it there
and he's playing fairly well whoops
we'll have to wait and see
I'm used to working with tablets
Chrome OS is based on Linux
you're better off with the competition
the tablet gets pretty good results
I think severe you as fantastic
I'm not outstanding but certainly fine
s5e we can exit have s6
so first is the tablet itself
that's very nice in the head
i really like how it looks
so that's all handy randy dandy
we're back to this bad boy
it wouldn't quite pick it up
they're like oh do i do
i love the silver and black
but it's been pretty damn good
these are my tyd tablets now
the box is the tablet itself
which is what we'll go through
so that's what's in the box
you also get a plug charger
I'll just be using these Wireless
so that's the only reason why
we'll come back to this shortly
so there's your YouTube app again
it's a certainly a recommendation anywhere
it was around 100 bucks so
it feels really light and thin
I don't really like the bezos
let's talk about the recording quality
thank you so much for watching
what is going on guys griggles
TV this is the symbols tango
pretty much resolution 720p plus so
I'll show you in a minute
you're going to get a microphone
which basically is really a microphone
headphone jack you get a micro
USB mini HDMI full USB port
if you want to get there
just make sure it's switched over
I could jump ahead really quickly
oh he's catching up to me
see if I can get running
I'm not good at any game
I ever did on this game
are you supposed to do that
let's just load up a website
click on one of these stories
Musk from the guy from Tesla
that is a problem but anyway
so yeah there's absolutely no way
and very nice flicker rejection on
Xiaomi does very beautiful stuff though
so it's pretty much an a4
I mean I yeah why not
i think it's supposed to latch
it is the question and no
the people just have different lights
I had no idea the lock
it's a lot of money right
language is completely to my liking
you can copy stuff duplicate stuff
it fits the pen very snugly
everything about it is super nice
Xiaomi tablet is also pretty interesting
leave them down in the comments
up in a super thin chassis
tablet isn't a problem at all
Sony's audio enhancements through these speakers
this is the Huyen canvas 13
here's how you could avoid that
I think it nails that landing
Times Square Madison Square Garden everywhere
it doesn't really reflect that much
it is a nice step forward
I couldn't replicate the Photoshop problem
no no you cannot make me
the box is a three-in-one cable
that's pretty standard with pen displays
it's sunk in a little bit
those tend to be more pricey
I couldn't test this I was
and so instead I I googled
Yuans website if you're using Samsung
have their own drawing app now
I tried was definitely infinite painter
so you're constantly repositioning yourself now
I have no problem with saying
that are very similar to this
DTaP m7 with a metal body
many phones are much better speakers
which is the only one available
during my time with this tablet
UI at all which is great
like a calculator the camera app
Android ninth I in my bed
and we'll see you next time
I thought was kind of nice
I can hit play on that
don't load up all that quickly
I think it's an OK tablet
hey what's going on guys this
ETA brought back here again today
jack unfortunately there is no headphone
I want to carry this around
it's ice blue and iron gray
we have 4 gigs of lpddr4
everything looks correct on the screen
I do want to mention this
it actually works really well here
it's not going to work here
you'll have no trouble using it
we have a similarly priced tablet
we scored a 263 multi-core 932
I used for this was 3dmark
great here earlier in the video
we went down to around 1
I'm a hardcore chrome OS user
and which one you should get
also fun fact they are interchangeable
they use a stronger glass instead
so which is my naked eye
so this is something I'm really
it's doing something right but basically
I've never really enjoyed the experience
that's a great place to be
we have amazing but expensive tablets
we're still looking for this one
it's really not gonna change much
we're going to look at this
Windows 10 supports the tablet mode
there's some travel on the keyboard
editing videos on here power do
it's a good example to talk
it works really well on there
you know you can open big
let me just get the keyboard
that's the only thing that's missing
you've got the pen you can
I really like about the screen
it turns it back your life
various prices depending on the configurations
I'd say it's a very nice
but that's more of that again
Jack does not go over there
it should be just up here
I could do this all day
it even has built-in FM radio
let's find out together the hue
I miss anything while we did
I would have to say that
which would have made more sense
but it's a proprietary charging cable
we decided to jump straight to
whenever we sped our pen movements
well that's it for today guys
we post affiliate links for products
it's a little door right here
I'm sure to eventually get jellybean
but it doesn't have a now
Android so for those of you
Andrew do I hear nothing special
going on tablet feels quick enough
3 tablet and on - -
the air also pleasant to use
I'm Lisa from mobile tech review
this is the fidgets ooh stylistic
Dave al Tavella for hot hardware
HDMI port right behind this little
this is a standard chiclet style
Metro user interface is very different
swipe in from the right now
the toolbar brings up the keyboard
they're in the background and asleep
that will come with a Windows
lots of different things available here
let's go ahead and show you
so obviously you get the tablet
it comes with this weird material
I've used them I pretty much
100% switched over to display tablets
it's a 10 by 6 area
which makes it feel very solid
has that almost paper like you
it's very thin on the back
there is this option to enable
let's draw a very faint pressure
I have tried this tablet this
it only works with this phone
it crashed and it lost connections
sometimes the mapping is not done
this review is about the newest
we really can't expect good cameras
I think we can thank Android
alright that's the end of my
the battery life is very short
I will be reviewing the V
I think it is aesthetically pleasing
they all seem to be working
the buttons have not been customized
the buttons do their job well
I think it turn out alright
I got it for 110 now
I'm a fan of these Amazon
press a little button power button
see what else would get so
this might feel a little bit
you can take it on trips
like double side usable active area
thank you for choosing my own
it is a battery free pen
the branding is here or on
my only pending is also here
ok you need to connect this
just click on apply and click
let me open recently save document
press this button to erase it
the pictionary game is particularly noteworthy
they have bubble wrap did okay
what's the impression is running off
I've never seen a headphone jack
it's not washed out at all
it's gonna do that fairly quick
you know most of the games
runs off one quadruple a battery
the keyboard cover is really nice
it has strong sturdy metal hinges
headphone jack on the other side
I want to thank today's sponsor
sixty-four cents becomes forty five dollars
its silo the whole time now
they just don't get loud enough
this is a very portable device
absolutely this is an excellent two-in-one
this is built like a tank
this is built like a tank
this is a first for me
so it's been tested by google
shall we not on very well
i wasn't expecting that added bonus
well i look right don't i
i believe let go and there
how'd you get out of that
welcome to chrome i use earlier
i will do that right now
i'm sure want a free gift
so that's what that does so
so we've got kindle in there
i thought it was pretty good
let me know in the comments
it doesn't cost you any money
Department it's got much smaller bezels
but what about the internal specs
this thing doesn't get that loud
we should be able to do
they're gonna be on sale for
now here is something new again
i would say so definitely now
this comes with the tablet itself
the bumper case charger basic manual
find out after one year now
there's also the rocker and down
a nice wallpaper can be changed
isn't it evo lands on here
i'm not gonna lie all right
maybe this one's the reading book
he is indeed a playful fellow
you can access the suggestion pages
i really like how they did
so that's it for this video
they have them for mobile devices
it's just basically one solid level
they have this conversion feature well
i set up a different test
you got your section for favorites
they have a google chrome extension
and that is kind of nice
but the responsiveness is pretty good
you can't really even see anything
1 gig of ram a arm
and doing some other basic tasks
you have to attach it yourself
this is not a deal breaker
the battery is definitely on point
don't make the mistake i made
i thought i could use this
this is just not the tablet
i'll catch y'all on the rebound
I'm only evaluating the Android side
you'll see a pair of speakers
everything moves pretty nicely and fluidly
this tablet boasts a 6.7 627
you have the all-important charging block
all the expected settings and functionality
you'll need a lot of desk
it's always good practice to color
it's definitely still useful on Amazon
GHz along with 2GB of RAM.
RT is still clearly a 1.0
however you basically need the Touch
which brings your total to $599.
but right now it just isn’t.
and you know my plastic oled
you have a very nice rubberized
this actually runs android honeycomb 3.1
models is better heat management systems
i believe it's really a no-brainer
Pro is a pretty powerful tool
that is included with the bamboo
that said that it did before
the bamboo capture tablet from welcome
it really is a yeah sort
it renders the page relatively quickly
that cost about a hundred bucks
so this is a short video
drivers really aren't even that good
everything is fast fluid and smooth
it's made just for the shield
how that throttles they also added
I've noticed that with this tune
it's almost stalling with the tune
I hope this video has helped
thank you so much for watching
you have any more questions again
i'll be showing you the process
time is a gaumon m106k pro
that you tap with your pen
i recommend getting an extra pen
i'll be breaking down the process
a character say for an animation
that's what i'll be using here
think about the timing backgrounds color
i guess there's plenty of videos
you've got your rough sketch down
i've got it's the hawaiian inspiroi
you see the buttons on here
my top button is the right
oops that's not going to work
i hope you've enjoyed this video
thanks for joining me on this
uh i'll catch you later on
so that is the tablet itself
obviously expandable with the memory card
pretty self-explanatory in terms of display
the back facing camera is 720p
C - full USB a adapter
you can watch movies on it
I'm using which mice I'm using
it lasts days it lasts days
keep making more videos here on
it would drive you nuts then
but that wasn't the case here
a little bit again only something
then you get the pen itself
it's really very very good indeed
thank you very much for watching
this is the kind of video
there is one version five dollars
this tablet is tiny almost uncomfortably
let's draw this is some footage
become graph ir4 for that cheap
so what comes in the box
banggood sent me this to review
good standard what you get in
you enter your google account details
i also want to mention now
we managed about half that here
but we're not done here yet
um wow that's metal as well
can you see the screen there
it's got plenty of charge comes
disable the lasers blocking the hallway
the terminal should accept your fingerprint
now what killed him i did
the screen is bright and clear
should you want to the battery
it's top marks for most users
and i do love a bargain
okay let's wrap up the review
and maybe they're gonna do new
its got three gigs of ram
I'm in the middle of something
I like this game so much
it's going to be an improvement
same goes for the sony scheme
you know a big step forward
it is still in my opinion
the best android tablet out there
that's what I use it for
get those games pushing the machines
so that's my opinion on that
we have the nuke 7 tablet
it didn't cause too clear anyways
it's going to be very reflective
we're not going to show you
Play Store Google Chrome or settings
so we're just going to start
you do have a page animation
we're not going to go through
we're going to go back to
so you can click the middle
that was really good for magazines
it always has been and yeah
I'm just going to say this
this tablet is really good though
it doesn't work on its own
it's grey outside and orange inside
the installation process is pretty straightforward
it's not so much considering that
the color should be quite accurate
so it should be pretty accurate
I'm trying to simplify my style
I'm basically only drawing digitally lately
it's also something after practice on
I don't remember anything of that
we sought out open flash performance
at how much more linear the
to put it through its paces
BRZ is probably nearing its completion
so that can be used once
how fast and there we go
I looked not much of work
you're not going to lose it
I can configure the touch speed
I'm going to select my paint
I'm painting on the canvas here
Wacom Bamboo fun pen and touch
I got came with the tablet
I really appreciate because I'm bad
a sort of angular pattern then
it worked perfectly all in all
then we're gonna do some art
I mean it is very sturdy
this is probably the easiest tablet
you know it's it's a wacom
I think for beginners for students
this is in the clip studio
I think I mentioned it before
who's never worked digitally before well
I've noticed that I knew dude
I know I do have one
Steven universe he's new thread jiminy
I'm going to wrap this up
it's what you would expect from
you're getting a pretty good tablet
it's a great portable option personally
but if you're on the go
you know pinky boo she's 12
it's a buy for me again
the price point is fantastic for
we'll talk to you guys later
hey guys thanks for watching clownfish
TV please consider supporting the channel
plus you can add more it
listen to audio books watch streaming
the screen is ok just ok
shot with it right now so
it is also much less expensive
are they happy with the product
Wacom screen in the background there
it's a really good graphics tablet
inch 1900 by 1200 display on
i was really surprised by this
we've got this mediatek processor again
i could run a few videos
is this not a good piece
we've got two cameras on here
maybe you saw the entire series
let's talk form factor and build
you know what to do now
what do you want to see
i had to make you wait
I mean not the hard drive
so we're back into Windows again
actually it runs quite quickly there
we go it runs quite quickly
can we get rid of it
I can see what it's like
I hopefully you can see it
ticking off down the bottom here
this is recording the video force
there tablet mode or proper desktop
it works well enough for me
Guns & Ammo read that regularly
it's it's a nice little tablet
let's have a look for gearbest
then we'll hit the enter key
little pipo tablet with me today
you can follow me on my
I'll just had to gone network
I'm all joined on it right
he hasn't put anything in yet
sorry the front camera is 0.3
there's no on or off button
it was really hard to use
i'm not super experienced with it
only a portion of the tablet
i hope you all enjoyed it
970 is actually the first device
but again you can see here
we can shoe up to 720p
and so it's a good tablet

my horizons outside of cubing videos
I've tried a lot for months
they're here to stay the screen

I did have with my drivers
now compare this to display tablets
obviously it's a completely different market
it is very similar to a
Wacom pen the nib isn't squishy

this part is always a fun
Kenting for sending me this tablet
the tablet comes very well packaged
stand the pen is really nice
brush here everything today for this
I started on my demonstration piece
this one sits in the middle
it's a nice size it's light
the screen resolution is really good
but they still are an investment
it has front and weird cameras
and you just tie the end
there's a stand in the back
let's see what this turns out
and right out of the box
that is $23 right now in
the product weight is 130 grams
the cable is not a micro
play using this tablet you yeah
you're comfortable with drawing with which

this is the dahle function switch
let me try the scroll wheel
it changed to changing the brush
it doesn't work so by default
Wireless pen with 2 shortcut buttons.
Just plug it in and play.
you need to install a driver.
Ok, now you can change settings.
Use the righthand slider to change
how sensitive the pen pressure is.
And for $35, that’s a steal.
You really do need a phone
that's a speculation of this video
it's not strong in the bass
ram count a 1.5 on android
that's more of a ramp issue
sources and magazines that you accumulate
I'm Jimmy with Jim's review room

around the screen are now slimmer
Android it still feels unmistakably sunny
Snapdragon chipset on tap the Xperia
this is a non gaming tablet
there wasn't much else on here
I took out in my garden
so this one has it again
I know I did you wrong

I basically wanted to do her
that'd be a nice little upgrade

and that's it for this video
how do i say it cable

I hope this review is helpful
i have a really good tablet
rocker seems to be a microphone
i played some games on it
i got around about four hours
here's a photo on the back
as well there which is great
So that's a really important thing.
And that's a really small detail
is they have things called templates?
Which allow you to get started
I'm gonna say I like it
I'm gonna say I like it
I've never really had a Tablet.
I don't think it's very well-priced.
This is actually the first edition
LPI which means lines per inch
and you could call it premium
I think it's pretty cool design
is the light every time depend
I compared to two other tablets
I have had problems with it
this is the pd 2200 tablet
we gotta get into the specs
hell yeah for this price point
the tablet is so worth it
i'm andrea for my next table
is the Apple iPad Mini 5
below the screen is the touch
oh it sadly there's no premium
there's no pen support though it
the immediate pad m58 is running
it is running a car comes
I'm Andrea for my next table
whoa and here is a tablet
this is honestly the biggest tablet
I'll be back in a second
I personally don't use these clothes
oh maybe for cleaning the toilet
it's a it's a cool design
I'll admit that I found that
in fact it was so good
I also really loved the packaging
I know I said it before
I honestly didn't find anything major
I hear a little cooking sound
I really really didn't like something
in order to ease your anxieties
he'll are likely having some quarrels
this leading to flame tails murder
I'll see you all next time
I've seen for most cases 324
this tablet had no slowdown issues
battery life for standby was impressive
C launcher is a simple launcher
that only consists of two screens
neither so you can type in
I got to be honest here
but the camera is just lacking

the tablet comes in this box
my favorite there are eight custom

music press again with voice recording
I have do a pattern unlock
okay and it go back first
we can download your own music
this is great so for example
I did set up a PowerPoint
okay let me stop it now
I have accidentally touch it right
so that is the time control
I like that they're using this
you get a battery free pen
is there in case the earlier
the ipad pros are only 5.9
the screen has a super matte
and by stuff i mean art.
the lines in pressure felt perfect
that tech for their display tablets.
that's just not practical and healthy.
another good worthy product by huion.
this is a 7-inch tablet runs
what game better to check out
so let's get that loaded up
I never play this game though
let me put the volume up
I took with the front-facing camera
especially you know for a tablet
I took with the back camera
the speaker isn't that bad battery
this is the canvas 22 studio
looks uh i'm not gonna lie
it looks a little bit flimsy
so it's not a plastic film
it's definitely not a portable device
i won't be traveling with this
the speakers are really really bad
this is a 22 inch tablet
it's only full hd so 1080p
brush strokes are nice and smooth
everything was working as it should
maybe in a future update huion

yeah it even has tilt functionality
this is a pretty cool thing
I've done over on my website

i don't think we need that
the lines are nice and thin
they say it lasts two years

I want to discuss over here
I'm using this this and these

I you can draw light lines
I received this tablet around here
so if you're big in there
see you in the next video
they're very sturdy thick secure boxes
it's very responsive it has 233
I don't like the glossy texture
with a tablet that's only 119
now here's a quick user manual
headphone jack a dedicated volume rocker
go for under a hundred bucks
I'll be reviewing this Samsung tablet

it's a simple and clean design
Wacom pen as I said so

it's actually one impressed with the
hello everyone welcome to my channel
H 640 p graphics drawing tablet
I've never been able to test
now here is the tablet itself
it's a lot smaller than ours
okay what else do we have
oh there is the stylist since
finally we have a connection cord
I was using in many bang
how it should have worked initially
it was a bit hard gauging
all of those worked perfectly fine
I wanted to mention was that
but unlike a lot of tablets
dock sells for about 160 dollars
the tablet it's about 1.6 pounds
so let's see what that happens
let's go ahead and do this
but they'll actually does too clearly
look at it now so clearly
swap them out in the field
so it's meant for outdoor use
this thing is pretty darn heavy
V Pro for tenth gen yet
it has the weirdest white balance
graph is off the charts bad
the one drawback is the trackpad
I've already taken out the tablet
so that's the working circuit error
each button comes with some indentation
this is the USB charging cable
let me show you the stylist
it's mostly made of hard plastic
it's lightweight but not too light
let me switch this on first
I've already installed the driver software
the default setting works just fine
let me jump over to mischief
it's like it's a bit abrupt
it's a bit more gradual so
this is a pretty straightforward review
now the type of features that
I plug this into my computer
I really like the box design
some people like that some people
don't that'll be up to you
it feels good in the hands
I'm trying to get stuff out
so we're gonna peel this open
click on your preferred one either
they're hard to see the buttons
I do like the scroll thing
at all tablet self feels nice
you can kind of see them
this is actually my stream setup
welcome back to a new video
I'm more than happy with it
so let's jump into the video
they tend to be more horizontal
it's not like you're sketching architecture
not as slippery as this one
you can see them all here
she left her mark right there
thankfully it didn't destroy the pen
so what about this sketching experience
this doesn't bother me personally but
there isn't much to be said
roughly around three to five hours
it'll surely solve the price problem
if you're using it for multimedia
and this depends on the model
I pick up the same pad
great tablets to the media pad
who's looking for a great tablet
I will give the Galaxy Tab
I hope you liked the video
the performance is kind of weak
that was released two years ago
don't get me wrong you certainly
obviously the runtime will be lower
I think they have a tape
what you'll do is you'll unscrew
C phrase which was now unusable
this is the first business tablet
that comes with a little toothpick
stylus that fits in the silo
it's not going to get lost
numbers unlettered their 45 watt charger
it is 2160 by 1440 resolutions
the tablet by itself weighs 1.7
I mean you really have to
that's different a lot of laptops
I'm good key damping not noisy
this is going to feel normal
I have HDMI port as well
here we have the fingerprint scanner
it's very easy to press it
we have an 8 megapixel camera
well it's coated in Gorilla Glass
that's what we have in ours
surface pro 4 is no energizer
37 watt hour battery Intel Core

GPS wireless vibration is quite handy
it's the current application memory cleanup
here out of the game so
there's a good reason for that
Starcraft 2 which recently went free-to-play
which is something that you've said
I think that that's perfectly doable
