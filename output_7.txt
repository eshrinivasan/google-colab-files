it's like i said it's very solid
stay and it won't be easily move
the hotkeys also helps me a lot
you go check it out so yeah
you can browse the web smoothly surf
YouTube and play a couple of games
that's a pretty pretty good battery life
hours just over nine point five hours
I make that mistake the first time
you're like two big pictures of things
it's a very good way for them
that's all the apps if you're clear
copy of a brand new gaomon pd
it comes with all the cables attached
v ARS g 1600 series graphics core
also onboard is one gigabyte of ddr3
let's talk about the build quality now
it really does go nice and bright
so that's good for a budget tablet
that's good i'm gonna give that seven
but there's very few settings you know
not one of those go edition things
it's this Gaoman s620 tablet right here
that's what my main research was when
alright so you get a warranty card
I mean nowadays all the newer stuff
I mean my hands are average size
so what makes this a good tablet
the most high-end ones have 8192 levels
I'm gonna show you in a bit
click to bring up my brushes in
I'm going to stick with the keyboard
the pen feels good in my hand
I forgot that I was actually switching
this tablet is a really good value
thanks again for checking out this video
see you in the next video you
basically from anywhere with basically no distortion
IPS displays do have slightly less vibrance
it's not the kind of screen protector
there is a hinge for the display
I don't have an issue with those
I haven't used any other display tablets
we probably should talk about the pen
I guess you could make the argument
practically speaking is that when technically better
I think I'm very happy with it
and in the meantime keep collecting you
that's the best little chest lover snare
she's name this shining on my head
max shinin on my exhale was next
send a text to your next while
shinin on my ass with my neck
always one man drop until the tears
we also find a manual of instructions
is this protective case for the pencil
it has no buttons for short keys
everything works properly and the touch feels
I feel like I've improved a lot
I recommend it to all of you
less would probably not be as effective
I feel so satisfied with artisul D22S
it gave me no trouble, worked perfectly
fine and the size is just awesome
i skipped everything to the main menu
and it's already used up eight gigs
now let me go back you go
Katara China Miata together with their packaging
Napa he storage there are 64 gig
they seem that you got that option
I could when you're partly to blame
beside opinion have seen a filter feeders
I could not come in the address
I feel adding an had a compliment
evening she wanted to delivery masha'Allah number
z17 inch tablet actually runs android 8.1
the screen resolution is not that high
the viewing angles are okay on this
it runs a lot of the same
it does have more storage on here
I'll see you down the road Poots
promo s is a tablet operating system
now it's a stylus device and so
let's just go ahead draw a beard
palm rejection is a little bit finicky
wow what's this a tablet review really
what are you doing get up okay
i couldn't even see what i was
chibi actually made a really good video
and it's not a huey on tablet
it's got such good pen pressure sensitivity
okay thank you so much for watching
Adelle and this is my son Jacob
its splash proof it's got Wi-Fi bluetooth
you set up a parent profile account
you might be wondering to yourself man
I'm not very fond of graphics tablets
it is a monitor it lights up
osoo which is a kind of a
it's got a report rate of 200
who's like trying to you know do
I'll make screen tablets um but anyway
i mean this actually rolls really good
i mean it there it it doesn't
um it's just a robust little tablet
they want that organic feeling of writing
now let's talk about the actual interface
so say you're done writing your thoughts
i think this is a great device
without going overboard it is definitely pricey
one is for youtube video planning so
it's a lot and it is nice
it's soft straw as you can see
so you would see it's a basic
this is the responsiveness of the screen
the responsiveness is not really that great
and it's definitely something that's very disappointing
okay here we go alright so again
it's a two-point no it's doesn't support
we haven't had any issues with that
let's go back to again the home
didn't have any problems with that now
unfortunately it's it's disappointing $300 for this
uh screen the new colladio plus screen
yeah totally different colors on these two
the front light turned off right here
i tried it with a capacitive stylus
you had to press down really hard
they have a few different reading apps
oh oh the whole box comes out
it's like so so got the back
oh wow that is stiff right there
I don't know you could hear this
we have nothing on the other side
megapixels and in the front was 0.3
I do not like about this mouse
now let's test out the web browsing
this tablet did a very decent job
we've got the power on off button
the screen does go very very bright
i think it is an ips display
you can also see that screen rotating
i really do like the build quality
stage just removing the screen protector overall
then this is well worth checking out
so that's what I'm going to do
SD card which comes in extremely handy
I didn't notice any issues at all
this tablet to test out in review
I very much enjoyed working in Autodesk
I used when I did the line
there's always a little bit of time
I liked that the pen was small
it felt very comfortable in my hand
rotating the canvas was definitely slower once
the screen resolution was not the best
you can sketch you can watch YouTube
I think this tablet is really good
I was very pleased with its performance
I could create sketches and finished illustrations
we have a 3.5 mil audio jack
it doesn't seem um to lose it
this device does have dual stereo speakers
we're getting average of 24 fps rocket
it runs great on this little chip
I had right out of the box
I'm very grateful and fortunate for that
there you can see the camera alright
1280 by 800 resolution a 10 inch
there's also a mode for eye comfort
she looks five years younger doesn't she
the screen is responsive even with gloves
so you might need a universal case
you guys asked for a more basic
the ink pad is using the same
let's get started on the two here
both of the glow lights are off
we did see in our tear down
I'm very impressed with the software experience
it handles all those tasks quite well
we're going to get into it now
unit from lenovo pricing starts at 1097.40
you won't be losing it anytime soon
look at the boxes just thrown around
life that's something we'd like to see
what do i think about the lenovo
we get from the thinkpad line here
it's got that think pad quality now
i like the battery life on this
i really like the camera on this
the rear-facing camera can do 1080p video
that's the lower powered tiger lake processor
i also feel like the four express
yes i have already revealed the g
let's unbox this quickly to show you
what's inside this is the warranty card
this is a charging cable for ten
this is a very solid pen case
very nice pressure sensitivity works really well
I really like to use keyboard shortcuts
let's take a quick look around here
we go and in terms of video
we ran a 1920 by 1080 screen
there's some things to like about it
let's see the box is really nice
I simple when I paint in Photoshop
that's what you see here right now
it feels just like a regular tablet
it needs no battery no charging whatsoever
ren and welcome to another tablet review
clean your screen as you should here
i don't even replace my nibs often
you'll get when you purchase this product
it's not one of those like screens
now i'll be listing down some concerns
what made you start doing digital art
I need to treat one thing first
I own quite a few silicone cases
it's already paired and all you do
is you simply leave on your Bluetooth
a lot of forethought went into this
you guys have yourself a great one
Picasso tap this is a ten inch
we'll take a closer look later on
that's this little battery for the stylists
it's very convenient very easy with this
we have a camera on the back
we have the logo on the back
there's another speaker on the other side
I would have preferred 108 opie resolution
you get we have cameras we have
all the way as we have any
that's why my desktop looks like this
it doesn't work that well earlier on
let's try and draw something again now
hot flow is definitely a nicer app
I really like drawing with this app
sometimes there is still a bit of
the lines overall they are quite smooth
let me show you a sketch that
I think this performance is quite good
it works wonderfully some of this apps
they are free some are paid so
let me know what you think about
this tablet are interested to get one
see you in the next video bye
I post a new video every Friday
I've used I had a Wacom Bamboo
this is my my favorite screen tablet
point is great and for the specs
you know you can take it anywhere
I'd say this is totally worth it
let us know what you think so
all right so it is the size
uh now for the pros and cons
we have the Intel Zee 8350 CPU
I'm going to start recording the screen
we'll do a couple of benchmark tests
PC that runs Windows 10 one thing
I'm not sure where this is happening
but yet only among the words that
let's pick on the first one here
it's definitely not the best all right
sup guys welcome back to world tunes
is this one also from xp pen
meme of "soldier, poet, king" so ...
the design is really nice in hand
by 1080 resolution there are 8 customisable
I'm always pleased to see these gloves
Gangwon pen I'm used to working with
I don't know if it is rubber
Galman is currently having a big sale
but you look at this tablet guys
it has a very unique design guys
i think it's called the hook design
this is the tablet box pretty colorful
now let's check the tablet pen software
this is what you need to do
this is um pablo nino's medium-sized graphics
it could be heavier but it's good
I found it to be fairly pleasant
screw driver to screw the screws in
mapping system now that that's all covered
there were no scissors on hand so
the buttons are plastic and they wiggle
all of them are rather minor though
i would have to restart the driver
use both hands for the keyboard shortcut
the answer to that is a big
see you in the next video bye
i use fire alpaca and imovie fire
so the user interface is really cool
2 because of the sheer great resolution
I just see I'm scrubbing the video
it's also very similar but even lighter
I hope you found this video helpful
i'm going to give you my thoughts
having spent some time with this tablet
i'm not going to say it's brilliant
it isn't as good as some phones
10 is well worth a look now
Android 3.2 installed which is quite fast
so and we can show you local
let's go to the emails as already
I'm not sure if that's in here
it's pretty fast already showed you debt
2 right now you can see here
goddess was the toshiba 8200 full test
it much improved from the surface one
it looks like it does about 415
I think this is a 10 point
it really does work very well did
I'm very very seldom getting any drawbacks
I'd say yeah definitely go for it
we had a nice thank-you message from
that's a good feature little little wipe
you use for like notes in school.
It's it's bigger than two of these
side button setup and a touch bar
I was also pleased to find that
you can get this guy on Amazon
this would be good for your kids
when you flip it a little horizontally
I'll show you what they give you
that's where the slow down for loading
it has eight gigs of on-board storage
you recharge it just by the micro
you can check out my www.cms.gov thing
um you know no stuttering no nothing
it does what it's supposed to do
you know on games like this now
Bluetooth then this isn't a bad starter
this was luke from galaxy tech review
that's acceptable but doesn't get too loud
I had with this is the case
and it's excellent on my normal use
this is Lisa for mobile tech review
maybe or if it's actually a plastic
Android Market also kind of a bummer
Arcos does provide something called the apps
it's neither very fast nor very stable
I'll crank up the volume of it
you can see it changing up here
it's pretty nice and readable looking at
the the screen is fairly an unresponsive
hey guys welcome back to clown fish
I'm actually you know what to expect
so that's the tablet now some guy
we reviewed it a couple months ago
I had no problem drawing it all
this pen is thinner than the other
maybe it depends and thank you to
please subscribe ring the bell for notifications
oh my god wait get out okay
a box inside another box nice nice
hooray we didn't need an exacto knife
I don't I don't follow the rules
tablets have on and off buttons thing
I'm just I'm just messing around okay
alright let's put this on the side
it has some nice dots on there
I started out with a small tablet
yes alright so anyway the only thing
I'll put the link in the description
this one uses a little USB card
oh yep this is a valid review
this is a 10 inch android tablet
see the dragon touch logo on there
i mean the colors are super bright
so this is a very big tablet
it's got a fixed and built in
it's got a good grip to it
I wasn't expecting which is one cable
I'm used to only doing for touches
it was giving me nice straight lines
it was more or less absolutely fine
I was very happy with this one
I can't say the Pens amazing individually
it's just one of those small things
I've changed the tonal value of plants
working on a larger drawing tablet means
I'm gonna be doing some comparison videos
I've never had any issues using it
don't don't buy to avoid this tablet
it's nothing but a big head headache
tablets i love drawing on display tablets
it only connects to a computer though
that's all for now for this video
i am very excited to say that
that's my that's where we're upgrading from
oh my goodness it is so adorable
this is the best brand collaboration ever
oh my god guys i'm gonna die
i cannot get over all these line
i don't need a super intense incline
it actually doesn't really move around either
that's another thing that i really enjoyed
I've like I have no space here
let's look at a little accessory box
I don't know about the other one
so you guys can still see okay
sorry so in the box there are
that's how used to working on a
I don't know what the numbers are
they're both about the same size yeah
plastic all the way around the bezels
I realized that I actually misspoke there
it's the resolution is one it's like
if that makes sense you know so
now this is not a 4k display
Wacom stylus that comes with the Cintiq
I wasn't told what's a you know
there's a volume rocker and an app
that were slightly faster than an iPad
which is the m0610 pro right now
then you can see the tablet itself
we'll check that out in a little
i tried it in my main phone
i don't know you can see it
she is one of the gacha tubers
wait another day to clear my thoughts
it feels really nice to draw on
hey guys do Daniel Dodson tut vidcom
so that's going to knock it down
beautiful and lovely has changed the way
there are other great alternatives to a
are you going to get a tablet
i will show you that later next
this is the work area outlined here
we'll talk about that later as well
we've got a couple things with note
it's physically almost identical to the z1
this is a review of the dragon
I think they it just performance alone
you can see 32 gigs of space
nothing on this side at the bottom
I think it runs really really well
it's not going to be secure face
there's a couple of gestures in here
yeah cuz you will not be home
TV bring it to you a review
this is a wireless pen tablet from
but let's go over the other aspects
it does come with a programmable keys
the battery is readily removable and accessible
it's right through this door right here
connections was relatively easy with this device
I'll use Photoshop it as an example
I use it on Phil right now
great accuracy the 2048 levels of precision
all the books products typically do that
this actually is a purchase from me
you just jump in and use it
is their little denim kind of cover
let's see how does this open up
comes out normal like the normal box
we go kind of a smaller device
let's see how this comes off again
we are back the device is on
uh i think i've been pretty good
focus okay first thoughts on the stylus
the writing experience is not that great
you can kind of see that okay
um but the writing experience is okay
i mean i can make it thicker
can you see that right back there
the writing experience is average at best
let's see if we can play it
it's gonna be able to work right
you can kind of see the coloring
i'm going to have to keep refreshing
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
and this is the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet
there actually sometimes a little bit annoying
T uses for video rentals and downloads
not sure that's really necessary but since
it's not limited like the Sony Tablet
the tablet weighs one point six pounds
and here's your splash screen right here
menu edit view format insert and more
well now we've got the a seuss
it acts just like standard notebook computer
Lenovo keys are a little bit bigger
performance is a couple of frame drops
if you print you get better accuracy
visit our website for the full review
my recommendation is no on this one
the keyboard is not a full-size keyboard
but it is definitely a 10 inch
ah i am so not doing that
i think i'm gonna measure it later
it comes with this stand the manual
the driver manual almost like the driverless
oh god i'm going to build stuff
help me and a bunch of screws
i'm not sure if i'm too comfortable
the pen is enhanced with appendix 3.0
the performance of the pen seems good
the problem is when you do that
i have no major complaints about it
that was sent over to me from
let's take a look at what's included
this pen is not powered by batteries
we have matte surface for rubber feet
the design looks very clean and simple
Mouse functions mouse clicks to the buttons
they always come out just the way
so you actually have to turn on
we've all the various drawing apps that
see you in the next video I
you're going to notice that weight difference
small ghost morrissey axolotl big mclarge huge
dr casket your boy sd jj jade
I also takes a three point five
he loads up very quickly as well
please do give a like and subscribe
i know what you want a successor
your words have not fallen on deaf
i've been a bit hesitant to do
we've got the stand a drawing glove
you're like in the eu or whatnot
a tablet is kind of a pain
almost a little on the heavy side
i didn't like it but this one
it's not the worst in the world
i mean you can deal with it
I probably don't like about this tablet
we're all free so the tablet itself
this is nicer from mobile tech review
Zhai board only well at 8.2 inches
take some micro sim just like this
and you've got the back panel here
Torx screws there's like t1 or t2
and there are no screws whatsoever no
God knows how you take this apart
I conjure a little bit smaller text
not quite as fast as a 10.1
this is a four thousand milliamp battery
SD card slot does support USB host
so we've got our flash drive mounted
Evernote's bundled and so is Skitch Evernote
W flash plays because plane is fine
I would recommend the larger and 10.1
visit our website for the full review
sorry he wanna know you sent me
dis like almost two months ago please
USBC card these fancy adapters for something
I've never had before in my life
I've decided to try and draw something
it was kind of stupid too again
it's already used up around five gigs
it's slightly slow but other than that
so thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
hey everybody it's lavender town and today
I wouldn't pay much more than that
this is an older model of bamboo
it's pretty much impossible to find one
they have their super clicky and satisfying
I don't think that it works anymore
I wanted to make a quick video
I didn't do the tablet justice enough
and and that's great it it is
this is not what that is this
I wouldn't even turn the thing off
they didn't plan on supporting this tablet
the customer representative they or the website
I hope to see you next time
this is a factual book about robots
as i said they'd had tablets before
but these were little leap pad tablets
it comes with this super robust case
and um what's great about it is
it has on off switch volume switch
there is space for an sd card
I did find something originally had $178
I don't get to go with it
here's the other section of the box
it runs pretty decently and which is
I bought to replace my very dead
how often you're going to need that
I don't like having no app tray
SD card slot here underneath this flap
it's a 1280 by 800 resolution screen
I really do like this operating system
Lenovo is kind of custom launcher here
I got to turn on right now
you can switch over to large text
there's some different stuff speak passwords color
inversions this is pretty typical almost tablets
you can't view it with sunglasses on
which one did I load on here
it's got a 5 megapixel rear camera
people are wondering how PDFs lay out
that really is no waste of space
it was $69.99 normally sell for $99.99
so if you go to your local
you have the micro SD card slot
yeah so that's basically it for accessories
these are just some of the apps
I have the tablet laying down flat
don't expect too much out of that
check out the link in the description
I didn't have anything that I felt
I actually didn't experience that very much
the driver didn't have a double-click functionality
I'm interested in your thoughts and impressions
I don't think we've discovered this yet
there's bluetooth is a gps built in
i said this is an android tablet
it's just a decent size nice tablet
i'll switch over to the back camera
it's you know really a tablet something
there's nothing wrong with it at all
you'll actually need an internet connection now
I could probably say about this thing
the actual tablet itself is very big
I'm here at my desk right now
thank you guys so much for watching
which can go up to 128 gigabytes
thank you again for watching this video
another the last part of the video
this video can be nice and informative
sure they'd be careful when you are
I really love about these guys is
they're actually incredible to talk to you
I was looking for a cleaning cloth
nope that good step two do these
do you guys run out of nibs
have you given me an extra pen
so that's cool on the other hand
tab and you can find the driver
I really enjoyed using to be honest
the device was really natural to use
I made a bit of a workaround
there are a number of significant improvements
I've got to stop talking about cake
brushes photo references video courses and more
it feels very premium something of quality
oh well um so smells like plastic
my dog is scared of the vacuum
i don't know what that is meat
i don't know what settings is yet
hey everyone this is teal from parka
the design is very clean very minimalist
battery life is rated at 14 days
that's if you draw non-stop this cable
so let me just put this away
let's see what's inside this small pouch
I have already or sign mine out
is the stylus pen by the way
you can change the buttons as well
this is the work area by default
the tablet is unusable with this app
it works very well too so overall
so that's all for my review today
things like t-shirts and skills are classes
I believe it's made for smaller hands
you can control in the driver software
it'll fit a lot of different situations
I'm gonna be signing off here now
my t-shirts all that kind of stuff
alright to turn your light pad on
is we pick which one we want
I've scribbled out on some computer paper
I said make sure that's taped down
you've traced over all of the bits
all the way up made them darker
I just get my form back there
Oh would he how to the moon
I think that's cute not at midnight
yeah and the brand here is nebulous
here's the asus memo pad fhd 10
quality is great resolution is really good
so it's really loud for a tablet
it was a part on the side
the pen that comes with the star
i just do whatever i feel like
i'll see you in the next video
Cintiq may finally have a legit competitor.
That's a lot of numbers, I know
And now she's immediately in the sky!
Do you know what bats look like?
I think it came out really well.
I'm kind of diggin like a smoothie
I'll go into that a little bit
you can usually get it for less
is it anything more than just moving
let's see if I can sue it
yeah the touchpad is not real good
that said it's responsive it works okay
hmm yeah it runs most applications now
one it's an so will HDMI port
connector interesting story about the power connector
it is really weird looking and man
there's no wrong way to do it
there's a little rocker switch for volume
I'm trying to remember what they claimed
well thank you very much for watching
the flash storage available is 5.9 3gb
the resolution was a little bit higher
you don't have much to work with
sharpness and dynamic range is pretty bad
it's a mostly stock version of KitKat
impression is only spoiled by three stickers
there is back camera which is flat
so you will need Mouse for that
I'm on the go and I'm traveling
so this is our screen area here
you could put your keys up here
I'm just going in all or other
notice it's set to double click right
okay here we are inside of Photoshop
we get a thicker stroke so what
I get a darker amount of that
brush okay so that means that when
let me just pinch to expand say
this is definitely feels like the pro
so it's 250 bucks for this so
income is for computers so it's not
I'm curious did you guys know that
the operating system is Android 9 pack
this puts the s8 into the budget
it's got a 1.6 gigahertz octa-core cpu
i think we have like 22 gigs
this also does have support for 2.4
this is directly out of the box
it's pretty smooth like i said before
i'm just not good at playing these
especially because this is a budget tablet
i do have some amazon prime video
just keep in mind that any video
the sound quality is also really good
hey everyone welcome back to another review
i mean it feels great to hold
it's gonna be smaller but it works
i think 16 by 10 is perfect
it's nice to have is another way
obviously like i said it's a 10.1
you're gonna be disappointed because number one
you can play games on this device
you can download those from the google
you probably aren't going to be playing
make sure you check that out guys
just wrap the main tablet now ok
made of pop grey matte grey color
and it's loading the page quite fast
the scrolling is a little bit sluggish
the newspapers or the fonts are readable
onboard storage is limited to eight games
oh my god this looks so good
I think this is the connecting cig
okay uh I think this is it
I'll just start with the speed paint
this is the final result at that
they're like actually a lot of people
I don't know how it felt good
you also get a 2 button pen
there were a lot of setup issues
it's very much like a tablet so
it was another box but more presentable
your girl actually ripped the plastic off
which kind of surprised me actually okay
i seriously should stop laughing at this
it has a 15.6 inches of work
so let's get drawing for the speedpaint
it's pretty good end of the review
i would go for this tablet immediately
so and that's all for today's review
i have no idea what i'm doing
fire tablet the 7-inch 50 dollar model
Best Buy Amazon and so new style
it has a touch home button here
we've it also has a smart color
it also has a ridges blue light
in so at nighttime you can look
it has the build quality it has
it's not that it's not the best
so thank you for watching my video
please do give a like and subscribe
I've just deleted what I've done now
it says display toggle for multiple displays
I programmed it to be for Photoshop
I've got a picture of a tool
because it's a clever bit of software
All right, let's begin with the unboxing.
One, two, three. Silk again. All right.
That's what it's telling you to do.
About a second on the iPad Pro.
Page scrolls. It's a fluid operating system.
I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen.
So here we go, one, two, three.
I'll do one, one more slam test.
Yes, you can do that with Siri.
that's going to get it all done.
editing, that is 100% not your tablet.
here from chicks tech reviews so today
we have a ten point eight inch
so this tablet also has dual cameras

I'm doing right here by the way
I mean I will draw for you
and that's of course the power button
Cortana and that is the next button
there is really nothing all those icons
it's a fluid process and it works
you can see using the task view
you can still pin all the applications
it's pretty impressive for a entry-level product
is this free free stand or something
I believe these are hit things earphones
it's basically made for a simple task
Amazon change their mind in the future
which is how my phone is configured
let's take a look now at performance
I think and for games and stuff
let me show you where the added

Pro is that the pen is beautiful

thank you so so much for watching
I love you so so much guys

the stock varies from time to time
I know you guys are out there

I have Radford's review of the 925
ooh the resolution is really really low
don't buy i would say you know
it doesn't look like it's worth $30
this would probably be worth $10 blink
you can see the drivers right here
it's ooh it's gonna be somewhere maybe
on the bottom you have dual speakers
the back camera can shoot in 720p
consumption has been really impressive as well
that's it's always look i can see
it's powered by android new macbook player
it takes approximately 25 seconds to pawn
it's basically just for school only school
i certainly have exhaustion so we can
almost normal functional bloom because the screen
so let's let's try the volume here
how the speakers work i also reach
we'll just select any video just here
there's a there's another usb compartment here
oh yes we're back to the screen
just click down below all those videos
there's a small back button like android
i am back to the home page
yes so so yeah no go back
facebook.com is blocked so they block facebook
uh i'm guessing it's all social media
i'm doing a nice case to help
we ever give it a spin spin
well it i read it uh well
it's really heavy if you are 50
it comes with come to the stand
yeah so it's very it's very good
it's kind of like a book program
catch you guys on another video peace
A pen with a same felt pouch
It's easy to shift modes in driver
Working area is 24 by 16 centimeters
I like that the lines are smooth
I hope that you enjoyed this video
welcome welcome to a new studio vlog
it's monday i'm in here all day
uh if you follow me on instagram
um but yeah that's why there was
um so i've got that to do
some of them are so expensive though
i've never used anything like this before
so yeah that size good for me
i don't know what size that was
so yeah these are the studio neo
aren't they like crazy expensive 69 pounds
um so the headphones are 69 pounds
um but first impressions are i think
um i've got nothing valuable to say
so yeah that's what i'm gonna do
i feel like this day has just
she sent me a really lovely note
just um it's from little friendly designs
oh it does come with a note
oh no oh oh my gosh right
but she has kept her instagram open
i mean look at that gift tag
yeah i will leave her instagram below
i've just seen a hint of something
it's a day off for me tomorrow
hey yo what's up and happy 2021.
you think i got time for that
you'll see that the promo is applied
i just recently launched my patreon page
hey guys welcome back to the channel
because it's the third tablet i bought
having the androids x20 is the board
and let's see mediatek mt 6000 version
here you can see the first difference
it's a lie so that is fake
i'll have a look at that shortly
it's got a little flash on there
you can see on the bottom there
it picks up the the local area
there folds down got the bluetooth keyboard
Amanda I love the comic so much
the waist is good it builds light
the quality of the screen is good
the screen dimensions seem a little weird
and you're looking forward to my animations
okay so as you may have noticed
but that of course doesn't mean that
I'm gonna give them preferential treatment either
I haven't been paid for this review
I run into this with other tablets
so that's pretty nice the only thing
and then we're gonna have another video
I want to talk about the stylus
we usually last me about three weeks
I wanted to demonstrate that to you
version 2.0 is an upgrade over version
and let me just show you how
I'm ready to send her my edits
I can make a duplicate of that
it keeps all my different activities organized
i guess i could take the subway
it's got like more of a premium
I don't know who has this map
you can get translations where that works
I'm saying about the screen very well
some of the other tablets out there
I don't have any issues with it
I post how-to guides and like free
it's kind of an older one so
Kay version 2 version 2 is important
it's got some buttons down the side
that's good you can show you that
it's not too light not too heavy
it seems like a good idea so
I've been using Photoshop Elements with it
this tablet and pen don't have that
it's it's a really nice feeling size
it was a joy to use so
very many places can attend to how
it's it'll have been safe in transit
the products are definitely improving over time
made with EZ bed freeware at easybib.com
something a lot of high-end name-brand devices
you get 8 hours of battery life
can you take incredible pictures with it
you have to check this one out
this is a device sold exclusively through
I've seen on department-store tablets for sure
there is a passable trackpad on here
the little power standby switches right here
our screen is loading up right now
this feels about the same as other
we're not having any lag at all
I did get this tablet for free
see see what we're getting ourselves into
I'm not sure how it pops out
I assume it just covers manufacturer defects
you can see that which is cool
but let's take off this plastic there
I'll be excited to try that out
that's on my computer laptop computer laptop
so there's a power button right here
how's the um how's the pen respond
it seems like it's following pretty accurately
it's not slippery like glass or anything
that would be useful to talk about
I'm starting up a clip studio paint
I probably spent two to three hours
do open tablet settings find detail mode
button - this one's on right click
please set your monitors to extend mode
okay so what this means is right
the third one is space so space
it's um now it's my brush size
I see so the klk our function
I want to test the tilt function
you know time would tell so far
but yeah the rotation thing is nice
it looks bad honestly drawing on it
I really like this tablet a lot
it was super easy to draw on
the drawing surface is a bit gummy
it doesn't feel like paper or glass
(funky music) (scribbling) (paper ripping) (paper crumpling)
The pen supports over 8,000 pressure levels.
Other display tablets have a control panel
The control panel has very limited options.
some more of my drawing tablet reviews.
i have an iphone 11 pro iphone
so let's pretend i'm talking to brett
setup all right you guys that's it
stay creative and have a wonderful day
it's a new budget price display from
notice here the lack of the word
well let's take a look at the
the pro also has a laminated display
that's available now at the time that
I'm doing this review currently pretty much
it really feels natural slow angled lines
I increase the size of that brush
you can tilt the pen this way
you could tilt the pen that way
the color spectrum listed here is 72%
II I think the colors look fine
there's nothing in the in the box
there is other stuff in the box
that folks were having problems with drivers
the pros definitely go with the pen
I think it's a pretty good step
let's take a look at the tablet
so this is the week vk 1200.
there were a ton of gotcha character
and that's how i got this character
i made these really strong at first
sensitivity works very well and responds nicely
it doesn't take up my entire desk
4.5 out of 5 stars the reason
your heart desires having the keys along
no problem because it's been in light
it's super easy to take with you
but it's got these little rubber grippy
let's take a look at this pen
that's at the top of the tablet
I haven't really run into that problem
feel when you draw on the tablet
I'll try to sort it out here
the medium version comes with all three
aha the surprise is the g tab
mp guys now i will tell you
let's open it and see what's inside
this is the play games play store
with good value put into the product
so it's recommended for slightly older children
it's a pretty good display for watching
what's on the outside of the device
but this has a one gigahertz processor
YouTube file manager settings and Wi-Fi settings
there and the reboot is not saving
so that's not really a big issue
know $5.99 so you can go back
things are not going well so hopefully
before we get into the video man
looks a little small little four-inch screen
so five was to press play so
I guess this would be the default
it's gonna connect press the red button
I got a radar built into it
see it's turn up and down everything
oh the button on top of it
AC is gonna automatically both mass AC
don't let no let me now cut
is you got settings settings right here
it's showing you your airplanes out there
if you got your password they got
I got to go back into it
I'll show ya cuz I know ya
so you're gonna see the door open
well obviously we know what's working now
dismiss iku so now we are losing
I see I covered the ops core
oh yeah yeah that's the link damn
I have three cameras on the way
yeah yeah custom to this with the
Google quit tab right here to iTunes
I love the tablet like I said
I think I need to update it
if you want to see the unboxing
I was super surprised to see that
tablets are expensive compared to other tablets
is this one but the closest one
it's really not a super big deal
let's get right to it so today
we got a badly pre-installed screen protector
it faces you very well no overall
oh they're having to do some finger
we can say that it is running
I've tried it just some old games
half-life game source games and retro games
we can actually use a stylus pen
that is left only puny and 3450
The previous Dash tablet was a 7
hi everyone welcome back to the channel
the second one is a usbc connection
if you look at the cintiq stylus
and what's cool about this end here
i'm not sure which one it is
the xp pen driver wasn't acting correctly
i will say this is really responsive
they have done a much better job
i wish wacom had something like this
I did see from time to time
I never talked about that I should.
I can literally dance while I draw.
I got a screen protector after that.
Oh boy, does it have a fan.
Once I changed that the fan behaved.
So yep, must’ve been a driver issue.
All I’m saying is do your research.
I have another tablet review for you
I've tried but you do feel uncomfortable
I found the pen for this tablet
there is a loop on the end
they were very easy to use though
I reviewed I've given them away afterwards
my laptop has issues with the trackpad
I stole a long way to go
I don't earn any money from them
thank you so much for the support
it comes with this stand of sorts
and you got like it's pretty smooth
so what this tablet does is essentially
Sid the Science Kid I guess I
for what do you expect wowee okay
how are we gonna do the legs
how are we gonna color the Sun
let's just use basic colors for pearl
Steven universe he has like a red
it really reminds me of vexes art
I'm really excited to try this out
which is a little different for me
drawing these stone edges pretty easy so
I'm so excited to have shown you
sorry no boring unboxing videos for you
it doesn't work particularly well for that
the one model is only available in
so portability is really important for me
but really this one just feels amazing
the pro mods actually kind of squishy
it doesn't feel comfortable in your hand
I've never had any problem with it
Wireless so I'm really impressed with that
just turn these two settings off so
it feels more like using a mouse
I think I programmed one of these
I said you can zoom with this
Photoshop is only going to be this
the entire tablet to one screen when
I had lot of fun making it
you can purchase it in various regions
it's a fairly small very lightweight tablet
I haven't got one of these tablets
the workspace gives a bit of information
you know in that instance but yeah
you know who is this for it
can you get a lot more functionality
on the go of it so see
this is just a great little drawing
well here's the new no joy 11.
so let's get to the hardware specifications
despite using a faster processor with more
it's got white in a shiny gold
you're going in the sack everybody next
I do like the little pouch though
it's like a secret secret knife pouch
you can look edgy and cool disclaimer
you know when it comes to lines
there are probably ways to fix this
so what exactly makes this so cool
so you're pretty much set to go
it just feels nice in your hand
I'm going to be completely transparent here
I seriously enjoy drawing on the artist
I will admit that I am disappointed
don't catch any of that that's okay
it's this this comes on and off
also you can see all of thee
I like that big fan of that
which in this case is an unboxing
now here's something about tablets with buttons
i've been pronouncing their company name right
doctor um little standards that you can
I'll make a book like that pirate
I mean he thought this was fun
this is what his last project was
I'm keeping the stylus away from him
we have the books on the cartridges
you'll move to it now which one
I really really love and it just
it's got a standard quad core processor
i like the idea of my eldest
pebble is calling it game store junior
it does what it's meant to do
you could press it all day long
I was able to type at normal
I said as far as typing wise
brightness is actually not a problem actually
is that when you flip it backwards
I could read this like a tablet
I could actually scroll we go through
I thought this guy will replace it
the artist 12 is a pen display
everything else is just like this one
those are really slick to draw on
it's nice to have not every display
you're also gonna find your power adapter
expeed pen also sent me a stand
hold your display in place really well
you've seen me drawing in the background
I can pull it off my desk
I said before there is some parallax
good it's all I've got for today
i'm glad y'all could join us today
i can already tell you right now
now how am i going to okay
oh this is a separate box okay
i told you it was greatly packed
we definitely don't want to drop this
okay bam very nice check it out
uh amazon for 700 and something dollars
um everything comes with instructions everything okay
oh my god of course but yeah
let's see what's up with this here
they got this look at this plastic
this is what i was talking about
the glove is so that was yeah
so you guys can check this out
okay just these let out these legs
this is the one that was 9.99
let's see what comes in this box
it comes in the box standard hdmi
i don't know this is a mystery
don't tell nobody if i'm not mistaken
okay this is a standard vga display
you got to go around the house
who knows what they got out there
yes yes in your in your community
I don't see many people using them
so it's enough talk about the cameras
wow this is a really good screen
now obviously we have got a 13.3
So I’m back and inside both boxes
A 5V 2A amps DC power adapter.
And your user’s manuals and gift card.
I installed Netflix directly from the Google
S20 is the better of the two.
i know that's not my usual content
and it's one of my biggest critiques
cylindrical god i did have an issue
oh my god my dogs are fighting
foreign foreign blue foreign pink tablet bye
moving on to the speed pane part
I feel like it clashes a lot
more about the tablet another thing that
oh just the light is gonna light
I recommend this tablet totally for anyone
I really hope that it was fine
a lot of people have questions about
hello and thanks for joining me today
Ethernet port headphone jack and a 1080p
20 comes standard with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
the fire 10 is much more powerful
CPU that Amazon uses in their fire
Walmart icon if we click on this
fire ten destroyed all three of these
let's take a look at some native
SNES pc engine Game Boy Game Boy
video from the internal storage so overall
if you could hit that like button
it looks like this little like alpaca
let's see how far behind the pen
this one comes with a protective caps
m106 k and as you can see
I don't think I'll be changing that
let's say okay this one's also B
I can go ahead and do that
what is happening slowly drew my face
just be like hey when you want
I still considered this one also portable
what's the difference between the different tablets
Haswell chip available but it's reasonably fast
you're not actually pushing down on anything
that's good for typing out short items
I really like this device the keyboard
I don't particularly love other interesting features
these actually look really tiny here though
like word or excel with covid lockdown
10 tablet decent display for budget tablet
10 lasted a day on average shame
accuracy is poor to add to this
I'm gonna go with the negative first
well let's get into the good dough
so there's a Netflix and here's Prime
how good this thing can work play
it's got some issues between the camera
this is the 8 inch screen version
it looks a lot like the galaxy
s4 basically their you know their design
get to that in a second 16
gigs of internal storage on this device
if you need even more than that
what more can I say solid performance
Adele and this is my son Jacob
it comes with a keyboard on it
the keyboard itself is excellent as well
so this is actually a metal keyboard
10 uh standard windows 10 tablet experience
um i'm not sure on the exact
so the hinge hinge is quite good
it's a metal metal design and looks
the of of the spare sim card
it's it lasts for about three hours
it actually does last a lot longer
um let me know in the comments
hey guys so in front of me
i wasn't really expecting much of it
first of all we have our max
we have a very lengthy user manual
i know a lot of people ask
let me try to shoot this guy
i'm just very bad at it okay
you can do a lot of gaming
this is what the book looked like
let's paint some great odds shall we
there is another pack of stuff inside
i'm happy with the performance in photoshop
i'm proceeding to test with microsoft word
what are my thoughts on this one
so it's kind of poor the sound
so it's not great placement others speak
I think it is a great purchase
nothing's here let's turn on the tab
the sensors in the elixir to application
i tried a lot but other sensors
it has some very bad viewing angles
only i have another galaxy tab here
you can go to blue light filter
you can use it to play games
I was definitely very happy to play
it definitely handled the game pretty good
we still have split screen and functionality
I showed you guys in the beginning
Zen motion is really that was function
of course we have security account language
the zenpad z10 is definitely a media
that hasn't been a discussion about that
thank you very much for the support
it's a pretty versatile and pretty inexpensive
I found that it charges very slowly
we're looking here at the weather application
what do they want to do here
i've used this is definitely my favorite
I don't even want to count them
this pan is not powered by battery
because there's no doubt the first app
it's not as smooth here as well
I don't really see any issues here
I can see that there is pressure
it's blanked out so to get pressure
I use this mostly for graphic design
looks really well here and this app
so that's all for this video review
see you in the next one bye
welcome to a new youtube channel today
so let's see what's in the box
software is your controller of your tablet
you can give him instructions to do
what every button does it's not like
you can set it up over there
Android 9 device would then connected devices
when do you think about gaming like
I'll speak to you soon guys bye
hey guys this is a sponsored video
but apparently that's what they call them
it's like you're using a real pen
because i know sometimes people have issues
but i just thought i'd mention it
i can feel it when i draw
i'm glad i found this out now
i really enjoyed drawing with this tablet
thank you all so much for watching
it's just as you guys might guest
it's got the name in the back
there's the front she'll keep this out
change wallpaper control info on lock screen
tell me it's screaming us right now
it doesn't really uh it's not okay
there's kind of a lag to it
let's go this way dark theme advanced
i've pretty much played almost every day
and this is a really good game
so should we get out of this
the video watched a video on youtube
it's i got uh samsung sd card
i wish it was a little bit
that's all the tabs we've ever bought
it's tablets are not known for that
it's actually large and has little pen
so why don't you go get dressed
this is an 8-inch tablet offered by
they also share the same screen size
I want to get into some testing
Walmart icon if we click on this
I 264 as you can see here
emulations going to be hit or miss
see if they got one in stock
area has plus or minus degrees of
they don't work on the opposite tablet
I'm just gonna draw stuff so here
they've draws just as great to canvas
I Oh I dislike that standard immensely
that's another tablet review done and dusted
i responded sure that sounds like fun
though they agreed and here we are
um that's where you download the driver
go for it and put it down
you have the eight shortcut keys here
um i wasn't sure what to expect
Compare the 15.6 Pro with the 16
To the side of that is Display
you can’t switch back to the brush.
You might have been in eraser mode.
thank you card for choosing their product
I found perhaps of a previous model
reach around in order to press from
firstly you want to go to the
I do quite like this tablet size
this is the most up-to-date pricing and
it's really up to your personal preference
I personally set up a ping code
the experience here gets the job done
it's not like there's really any extra
so let's turn up the volume here
look super crisp and clear on here
I hope you found to be helpful
thanks gavin for sending me this tablet
so i'm still in my mom's workspace
there is a 10% off coupon code
you have the tablet itself first underneath
they say it'll take and the point
the first is and will always be
it's it's not for me personally but
it's great if you don't like it
I'm actually going to be using it
that sounds weird but let me explain
leave them in the comments and hopefully
brushes photo references video courses and more
the device isn't a multitasking or gaming
which is below average for a tablet
we will catch you in another video
our numbers got a lot of ports
so this is where you can do
this is a standard think that keyboard
[Milo] Hey! That one's for me! Buddy
A black box. What a reveal. Beautiful!
This is the Wacom pen right here.
Even though it's a Wacom Cintiq 16.

o plus the inside is pretty messy
I can go back to my drawing
this is literally my first tablet review
YouTube channel this is not Josie today
this is the vehic new graphic tablet
yeah okay yeah it is really good
but this one is a bigger version
they cut costs on things like packaging
you definitely don't need to charge okay
which is the buttons and the buttons
hey yeah this this is the thought
I wrapped it up a paper now
I got our that numbers killing me
it's the things that I will add
very smooth the surface of this tablet
the driver a little bit better okay
I click and it becomes the eraser
I'm totally fine with the stock settings
we really and hope you like it
or what's your rating about this thing
this is my second favorite one okay
I don't need to keyboard around that
uh you get the itty bitty tablet
Let's see. What else is in here.
I think it's better for holding maybe.
Looks like it has some buttons here.
And let me put this on here.
I think around 20 bucks, so, nice.
I'm gonna use my laptop to paint.
I feel like this is the Matrix.
XP-Pen We managed to power it up.
Let's see what my art looks like.
Wow, I actually really like the color.
A way that I love testing out
One of my highlights is the glove!
I barely even noticed it was there.
So I have two Artist 12 tablets.
So you have two chances to win.
Rule number one, follow XP-Pen on Twitter.
Aww Milo. Looking forward to the giveaway.
what's slightly better than Huey on you
I've installed that it's worked very well
so there's a fair bit of glare
it's very very similar to the huion
the screen size is also getting bigger
well this is the Xperia z4 tablet
which is the last tablet series from
it isn't too bad we're in heavy
its take run to till 3 hours
it is still able to run well
that's actually a review unit from gaomon
it has a nice rubber grip here
you can see a little sleeve here
make it comfortable for you to rest
they have very nice feedback to them
this tablet can also work with windows
you just have to press this button
driver is when i start my mac
this is the line quality test now
the performance is very consistent and predictable
i have tested the tablet with photoshop
you're getting 2048 levels of Pressure Sensitivity
[and] These have tiny little OLED screens
10 Home Edition built in fully licensed
so you can plug in a standard
the battery on here in light usage
I would expect it to and again
most of them might cost the same
does itself so this keyboard trackpad combo
they only give you like 90 days
life seems acceptable for the price point
I saw the box and its quality
more on this in the video ahead
but the tablet of course is wired
nothing else but don't get me wrong
exuberant here from you for this feature
it is right there with this pen
Facebook pages and they are really helpful
this is a new model for 2017
got your apps in the home screen
I mean the build quality feels solid
it's like a different way to read
I got a different video for that
we've also got like the lockscreen pin
and here's two kind of weird okay
i'm ryan welcome back to the channel
so here's the box t-pads tech list
that's my old t-class t-10 over there
we have this box here with goodies
two sim cards or one sim card
let's check the about and as advertised
and there you go guys android version
the 5 gigahertz band is supported battery
hopefully you guys can see it clear
we still have the screen protector there
this is how this double sounds like
this is the back camera recording 720p
single core score and multi score score
i keep finding nice stuff on this
i think this is a nice tablet
yeah i think it's a good unit
thank you very much for your support
it's got your buttons on the side
it specially looks slightly quicker response time
the only problem for me is that
it's great and thank you for watching
they're passing the savings on to us
there's no rattling or anything like this
it's actually performing better than i expected
so this is one area that okay
slow random writes there with this one
time is very slow for this tablet
this is one of my own videos
i recommend using a headset for this
otherwise you have to use the microphone
my mobile phones are getting as well
the same goes for the loudspeakers here
these loudspeakers actually have a good volume
i don't think it can be beaten
now it does come with that con
i felt really fancy opening it up
that's because check this out ready ready
um but you know what i think
i want to draw something else now
stand the base is really really small
and it's lightweight and made of plastic
i tried it out with my laptop
it's not the size of the tablet
no i'm not gonna make that joke
drawing on this tablet felt really natural
it has a nice texture to it
i really hope you enjoy the comic
i hope that this video was helpful
so finally another tablet review from me
so this is tech last new flagship
it's not particularly long this cable either
I don't have it maybe later on
a very tiny poor sensor nothing amazing
but it's not the best audio quality
okay and then volume rocker right here
so this is made out of plastic
the feel of this button is okay
we've got two speakers up with firing
so let's talk about the ROM performance
you comes right up here to that
that actually seems to be pretty good
I used to swipe up like that
I've placed only eight minutes of phone
but here's just a quick sample this
I use my football probe and checked
I won't even bother with a sample
royale there which was good and something
this is Lisa from mobile tech reviewer
look it's the black surface pro right
so you've got a lot more horsepower
we're going to talk about it now
it has a quadruple a battery inside
line in terms of the pressure curves
good for people who are working outdoors
well the only drawback here is battery
but you know that's an okay capacity
I'm really impressed with how it keeps
where the displays are a little lackluster
this is among the most affordable ones
protector that you have to peel off
it was very satisfying to do it
I must say to install the tablet
I know anyway as you might know
maybe by the way if you're wondering
I didn't want to start any other
don't care about it because yeah anyway
it's got a good weight to it
it use 7.58 gigs of 32 gigabytes
the brightness is at about 54 percent
so now we've got some games installed
uh graphic settings set as high as
so we'll go ahead and hit okay
we are in a little multiplayer match
this will go into our settings here
XP pen cost is the virtual wheel
I like the clean and simple design
I like this compared to those slider
it works really well and this pen
this is very convenient for changing brush
well let's just say that this pen
the darker is on the left side
it's located here at the bottom left
this is a still me me max
so let me open up our flow
they can't choose that we are 1m2
see you in the next video bye
my name is Jackson in this video
I'm assuming also serves as a pen
I think they work like Express keys
the tablet is on its default settings
I got used to it pretty quickly
the colors are going down quite nicely
I liked the surface up a tablet
I finished a bit more all right
the drying process was very very smooth
it will do the job perfectly fine
this offer was indeed very validating haha
Veeck VK 1560 it's brand-new pen display
this product was provided to be by
it's a really nice size to draw
it's not too small it's like the
lets you set it at any angle
there is a downside to doing this
I thought it was a good screen
i think there are just other devices
I have a tablet review for you
well if you know me you know
I kind of like that about it
the pressure has to be used great
if there's still that reoccurring problem okay
it is a pretty affordable price $90
it feels very well on the pressure
I was like yes yes I will
okay going to help a tablet works
I'm comparing it to the other tablets
I've used the welcome in to us
so that saved me like two hours
I didn't notice a lag or anything
Gama for sending me this and goodbye
oh there's an article here like this
let's let's watch one or two videos
that's the cool thing about seven inch
which is the picture as a background
it's really fast at a power plug
let me get faster oops what happened
I don't know what why it's muted
I push that very easy all right
so that's it for this first video
price is 249 euros to $75 then
AM you do have an integrated multi
I actually enjoyed typing on this keyboard
meerkats know that you get in display
I mentioned the front facing camera now
looking at the top of the tablet
it does have its down site fire
Without further ado, let’s get to it!
Let’s check some of the other stuff.
Paint the pressure was much more precise.
obviously, about 25x16 cm (10x 6 inches).
Kind of the usual medium sized tablet.
as what we’d find on a wacom
fine, both the tablet and then pen’s.
Saying "I’m impressed" would be an understatement.
The Android mode, I think it’s great!
See you soon and take care ♥
do you have a secondary on compartment
just um cooking up your space there
I love trying out new art materials
this tablet comes with the tablet itself
click for the pen button so instead
I think this is a great option
the erase function here is pretty cool
you have 30 seconds to you erase
it's a bit prone to accidental markings
if you're not careful which is why
the premise here is very much simple
it's a replacement for paper and finally
let me just actually do something here
I think you've improved the brightness there
that is not a galaxy tablet okay
I play a lot of online chess
they are all exactly the same specs
good the bow on next time visual
inch guys hair or screen color size
Malaya has caused a panic or bush
whiskey full lamination technology which is technology
T landscape Nirvana's Arthur or Easter Bob
it comes under continued so is bar
give me the acceptable picture camera head
Omega pixel kisame cameramen tada - Elka
Alex I 0 temporary leg is Kobe

O'Hare police'll Agartha a BB scooper dress
shells are a match you know he
they came to up the acceptable desig
my heart they just a gas fold
I pay Archie had I got up
normally you square there was a pure
hello and welcome to a new video
it's twice the size of my old
who's looking for a tablet so yeah
so that's what I suggest you do
I'm currently using it on a Windows
haven't even updated some their other flagship
how much thinner can these things get
Samsung has finally incorporated an aluminum bezel
Samsung gets rid of the IR blaster
Samsung is not using their latest processor
another feature is from the home page
you see me doing here and so
they did me a lot of time
we can exit this by going here
we just exited the kids login there
we can play with these children apps
it's you know better than most tablet
which is the newest compact pocket-sized full
and then this one came in 2006
they actually have the same screen size
I'm a kind of a slow ruler
Corning is fast and it's totally readable
you don't need like some super crazy
so it's gonna load the share folder
it should load or at least before
I was doing it through the phone
it took like less an hour so
I'm very good as you can see
I'm I'm sitting next to the HDTV
is that exactly the way to do
it lasts eight hours in a PC
but let's go to the game where
it's got quite a bit of grunt
so that's what these locking mechanisms do
I mean with the whole thumb issue
I can easily cover the camera there
you'll here's some of the key differences
Docs to go and things like that
you know it's like two minute later
I noticed there was something else June
obviously when you turn it this way
I think that that really helps also
and your frame will drop a bit
You see these things there and there?
And finally, the load of spare pen
However this tablet is far from perfect.
it doesn't feel super premium or anything
I will say that the one thing
that kind of sucks about this tablet
the back of your hand starts sweating
let me just go to something colorful
ah we go to Asterix and Obelix
this one is a touch below that
the rest of the audio is again
so what is it about this that
it's not good as you can see
put it that way there was decent
so let you guys see let's say
and yeah you can see that was
okay before we move on to you
this was completely out of left field
I think I played for you guys
Club G candy crush candy crush okay
oh my goodness it's so so bad
our camera is so good and then
there is no usually for discount drivers
you will set it to your monitor
that is as light as a pencil
power for this pen is very good
the drivers are downloaded from prions website
my pen is on the surface now
this is unusable in me dying paint
let's see what out of software do
the beaut quality is actually quite good
there are balls so for us $80
yeah so that's over my review today
honestly because it's bigger than the tablet
the driver was quick to install so
this turned out way better than expected
hey everybody welcome back to art by
and it's been a long time since
I currently use a Cintiq 22 HD
I'm really excited to try with this
in our case it's the in spheroid
it doesn't have enough weight to it
so who would I recommend this to
it's also going to be also friendly
I think my wife game is broken
not really too much of a difference
but it really doesn't matter too much
comparison as you can kind of see
it becomes more apparent when you overlap
that wasn't the case for this pen
give this tablet a solid 5 stars
your tablet pen preference can be different
OC related contents in the near future
In 2019 Wacom released the Cintiq 16
The Wacom One is lean and mean.
The pen has over 4000 pressure levels
Pen tilt is supported which is great.
Even with the more budget minded tablets
I have this STAEDTLER, Noris digital pen
brands will be added in the future.
It's very lightweight at only 2.2 pounds.
Installation was very easy to set up.
This is very useful for doing video
So who is the Wacom One for?
It also feels great for note taking.
The Wacom One offers excellent pen quality
that's only exceeded by Wacom's Pro Pens.
some of my other drawing tablet reviews.
how about service bribe to China Tech
I really enjoy riding on this display
the riding experience itself is pretty incredible
thank you for watching if you enjoyed
it has a large rubber grip here
we have four rubber feet and here
the lines come out just the way
this is a finicky designer on the
I want to show you is higher
and that's all for my review today
see you in the next video bye
with its Amazon fire HD 10 2019
I tried that one's great as well
however that's not my experience at all
I think the performance was pretty good
I decided to get the blue one
that's what many cheaper tablets are lacking
TM standards to support Netflix in HD
hands-free that means you can call her
many of these ads are for books
adjust does not always look like it
that depends on what you're looking for
it's not really worth it to upgrade
I'd personally go with the Samsung one
that was sent to me from gearbest.com
Patty County go up down left right
there are other functions like accurate more
so here you can choose to map
let's take a look at other apps
it's really worth the money as for
I'm the producer of before you buy
very fun very useful and very nice
so you're going to get pretty decent
the ports on this are pretty nice
I haven't reviewed for a long long
I haven't asked to see the video
Android version 9 so nice and up-to-date
this is what the screen looks like
this was in less than optimal lighting
let's go across to this one again
I left a link to the van
this is what the back looks like
I think is admirable for the price
welcome back for another video so today
they put the power button logo which
just feels really great for this tablet
obviously the brand it's chewy or chewy
VX 3 7 inch android 4.4.2 tablet
so that's what you got in there
everything is responding very quickly to what
Android tablet with a quad core processor
it comes with a removable keyboard case
it's been working great for me what
I wanted to look at right now
graphics were pretty smooth which is nice
but it's also because of the angle
we get the Intel and 3450 CPU
Bluetooth Aniki and um listen that way
I was quite surprised to see that
The company is using you to profit.
So, what to do about all this?
Give the product the rating it deserves.
As of now I am quitting tablet
she is right in front of you
are these front mounted speaker grilles here
let me go back to s note
I have four things open at once
previously tablets were really just about consumption
I've used several tablets in the past
you can lock the tablet in place
I put this down to muscle memory
I did find that every so often
do not disturb your built in memory
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
it looks like a fairly quality piece
we've got some plastic on the edges
Tegra 2 CPU standard stuff right there
Wi-Fi 807 BG and a single band
I think Google doesn't really want it
let's see what talking about right here
they're gonna take a look at gaming
it's not the highest quality cutscene everything
I use LCDs most of my life
which would be this tablet right here
it's annoying but it's not deal breaking
so there's that as you can see
very impressed with the standby battery life
this is a pretty light game though
I think sometimes it goes actually higher
Noga it has 3G calling tablet capabilities
it is just a smooth and blank
the video and sound quality by playing
the bag is thick with many pockets
this is the yoga 2 tablet now
the front-facing camera is on the side
hold tilt and hang on the right
bezel is the headphone jack right now
the blacks are also rich in color
the chassis is built from plastic now
your hand naturally rests over the camera
if you rapidly tap the shutter button
a tablet is their number one device
suppose this is what you probably expect
so let's see how well that works
I have to say that works pretty
it's not too bad doesn't volume reasonable
it's it looks really good on that
I guess you it's not bad idea
it seems okay another nice feature that
I use so I've just tried a
it seems fairly smooth like 3d games
don't forget to subscribe to this channel
it weighs as much as a competition
the back of the tablet is protected
and that one has a metal hinge
better thought through when using the do-it
I've installed YouTube Adobe Lightroom Netflix onedrive
and in fact you can install normal
viewing angles are very y2 sure on
it supports 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity
I think the pen is good enough
I did manage to end the video
it surprised me in a positive way
another direct competitor is the Microsoft Surface
hi guys come in here so today
open the box and see what's inside
and here's the specs so 8 inch
which makes it feel a bit inexpensive
saturation which is surprising for an IPS
it's not as long as it looks
i'll go over the pros and cons
um it's very modern and attractive looking
the pen doesn't need charging at all
i was drawing so i was like
the the cables are kind of finicky
here's a picture that I took earlier
just turn against us pause it so
take it back screens nice and responsive
I haven't put the screen protector on
easy to set up can't go wrong
it takes a while to launch apps
its it has a pretty slow response
I'm just going to record a video
its has a pin and light design
also as a pre for $100 tablet
let's just talk about that real quick
so and that should work perfectly great
this is also a lot of time
you can see the screen right here
see how high we can push it
the videos a little bit choppy when
you'll definitely be able to do that
let me jump into another game cuz
I'm not very good at these games
I didn't see a ton of customization
I probably wouldn't know fully recommend it
we'll see you guys down the road
I phone eight all right so yeah
there is a ton of dust here
packaging is pretty nice so they have
this is so i was saying that
it's gonna draw a super thick line
I'd say I don't have any complaints
let me actually bring in a four
I don't know decent and what else
yeah this this color with blue eh
used is what I paid for this
so this is a basically a vivid
so there's different styles of pens right
this isn't always the case right so
Phone no there's no Windows Phone app
what else can I say about it
let's call it is is perfectly adhered
but they're clicking so they're decently clicking
this little leather pouch is super nice
well so you if you find on
I think 90 times up until now
yeah that's about it any other questions
I haven't ran into such an issue
the z4 tablet doesn't necessarily change that
should you decide to use them picture
it takes decent photos and good lighting
I changes a few things from stock
Android like the color scheme and customizable
they're putting into these things and if
submit your game idea by April 13th
I wish I went with the purple
it appears that all that is gone
there are some extras in this package
it looks narrow enough to me catches
I couldn't find it on their website
it's just really hard to unwire years
it doesn't have pen pressure or go
this is partly because of the things
Wacom one this is a cool idea
hey this is a great pen display
I mange for my next ever calm
Scylla no vote at m7 is fantastic
SD card slot and a headphone jack
and there's no real dice at all
it's goes to worse than the cheaper
every tablet that is released almost worldwide
not much for ports on this one
this connector causes some trouble over time
you got a built-in microphone over there
they say is up to 10 hours
you can certainly get by with this
Allegretto the four guys with quarters podcast
so this thing does get pretty bright
I do a review on a tablet
it's not the big HD version still
well we have all the other goodies
welcome to the video from the lifestyle
look at it as a tablet first
we'll talk about performance in a bit
it's a core m7 processor with plenty
I did have some of the pen
I'm a good drawer with the pen
reproduction as you can see from there
of course you've got the keyboard fly
well my short time with this device
Windows tablet apps full desktop on there
that goes with it on the ditch
let's open one of the photos here
turn it sideways for a better experience
youtube came pre-installed in the Google folder
one of my favorite games is solitaire
set up for me there we go
it's an ace in ten and that
I love photography in the 8 megapixel
Matrix pad s20 has everything I need
however the real selling point here for
you expect it to plus more okay
the side buttons can be physically pressed
it was very accurate tracking our movements
this is a super mobile tech review
this is their mm pretty much only
display the usual 1280 by 800 resolution
but that's that's how they're marketing it
that would be for a SIM card
who really just want straight pure Android
you're not even a half volume pop
but it's not harsh it's not tinny
Oh Aaron is all over our faces
Wi-Fi and battery level indicator over here
let's go ahead and show you that
okay now we can bring this back
these days you've got pension zoom available
the tablet re-renders the image very quickly
that will go ahead and pull up
who don't know graphic tablets or pen
this is a standard drawing tablet meaning
I don't know what this material is
it's that same kind of glove materially
it's nice kind of a soft fiber
it's fine the other things you get
you're using so this is great brief
I was able to sketch really easy
the pen is you know battery free
it has a nice weight to it
I like to look and design aesthetics
the control wheel provides very nice feedback
I'm not sure what keen mode is
this is the work area by default
I'm drawing the trackpad on my laptop
there is also input pad and now
that's a very typical for the shop
let's see if device can taper nice
is their phone tablet or something else
I recommend using this tablet with desktop
see you in the next video bye
some we theater applied onto the screen
it really should be a bit better
better score and cost us $30 more
well those are benchmarks at this price
that wasn't the case with the lenovo
Chrome with a lot of open tabs
it's probably another issue with this small
Netflix in HD synthesis not NHD Ted
Lenovo should have used an IPS screen
is the software again we often saw
you might not get any local volunteers
every tablet that is released almost worldwide
also there are four options on the
Left pane mapping function and about us
I'm playing around with the sensitivity here
and it was mapping all right so
being offered anywhere and speaking of design
their default functions are also working fine
I decided to test out the pen
the mezzanine gets 5 out of 5
I think it's a great beginner tablet
and it's a nice little upgrade that
the tablet weighs 308 point 44 grams
Cortana what's up it's - maple Saturday
that gets it up to one point
Wi-Fi still works with airplane mode enabled
a pair speakers really helps a lot
Windows version of Minecraft with subtle lag
modern combat 5 runs officially on it
so this is almost an unbelievable bargain
they put ads and stuff like that
they don't have the Google Play Store
one this is a little like widescreen
the switches are on the top portion
compared to the fire tablet otay constructionwise
I will tell you about this way
the features are mentioned on the box
so you don't need to charge it
I was drawing a sketch of corner
we're happy to see it more on
Buck Lightner we'll see you next time
now let's quickly open up the pack
ID right there is in volume rockers
MP camera with their company logo fit

this way you'll be alerted every time
here's a quick rundown of the specs
and you also get your keyboard cover
I want to know what you think
I was actually pleasantly surprised with it
I'm curious to know what you think
this didn't give me a rich sound
I'm not crazy about its battery life
don't forget to check me out on
is that painting not sure could be
google likes they've been tested by google
it looks like on off button now
okay so it takes a headphone socket
which is good should have done that
that is the screen protector in there
i'm not going to use it yet
she goes so that was an opposite
so that's quite a nice little feature
so here's all your settings battery 96
see how good she is no internet
join the free vip blah blah blah
let's turn it and take a photo
i don't need that no more delete
this might be the baby for you
this is a $60 tablet offered by
love the form factor of this tablet
I said Netflix is a very well
and there's lots of stutters going on
in my opinion it is the best
now this is um a pebble gear
it's virtually exactly the same thing now
i don't know we'll soon find that
it's the usage of the actual device
the best thing about this is actually
why not give him something to play
miss pac-man's on here you're probably thinking
this is where the problem lies right
all right here we go come on
there's no volume some of these books
ah there you go an amazing snowman
yay olaf is not your everyday snowman
his brother marshmallow is a playful fellow
we do know a lot of kids
this is the pioneer wt 7600 nex
and it's a floating screen digital receiver
tones and the colors will be reflected
this is one of my favorite features
you can even change the clock font
that's interesting because not even the iphones
such as bluetooth and wi-fi one thing
i forgot to mention this unit offers
so i'll get more into that later
the remarkable has wi-fi for transferring files
you've got to use the remarkable app
you've got the undo option right here
you have your sections for your notebooks
you've got all your quick links along
let's go over into the settings menu
so that's where the wi-fi comes in
it has three per row all right
the text is a little bit light
some devices have a way to darken
this is one of the poorest screens
it's easier to look at the pixelated
it's important to check as that's why
that is so clear and so big
I can't carry around and stop work
which isn't a problem since that's expected
and i say that to say this
it wasn't that painful or was it
all right let's keep it moving connectivity
personally i am over the headphone jack
hello everyone and welcome to droidforums net
I bring to you the tech glass
this tablet is quite a unique device
ok and i can scroll through it
so you're going to see the background
let me turn this back down again
I believe this is a great device
you're pleasantly surprised at what they have
now that we've gone over the specs
I think this is a good entry
Cover to get everything out of it
another review about collagen tablet research guys
and that's all for our collagen review
the toshiba thrive just weighs under 1.66
it really reflects some of its specifications
this is going to be increasingly important
we're going to be doing some direct
I'm going to be reviewing the Wacom
this is the video review on the
that wind press have a different function
capture does not include an eraser now
then the bamboo capture is for you
it does have a nice display though
the magnets will kind of line up
and then you have a headphone microphone
you know we're processing web browsing email
does it feel really familiar and comfortable
it's a little on the warm side
I really couldn't even tell the difference
and of course settings for any controller
the torque dip is almost completely done
I want to talk about the open
I'm not trying to say that open
flash tablet the news market for these
the car runs a lot more smoothly
I really don't like about this tablet
I'm gonna scribe it in three words
I've ever been through in my life
the point is just like the open
I say that I wouldn't buy it
the two tablets work exactly the same
is that the version 2 is better
meme or a gif or a gif
think of what you want to animate
all you have to do with this
you can't really see it very well
um what i'm going to do now
i've got my button on the pen
is it so press it over here
you can shift it you can out
there's my goofy whoops there we go
but that's what this side is for
we've got a full-blown 1ul in seven
they say 2020 and so very up-to-date
I would just say the cameras there
you can listen to music on it
that's they the these are the devices
I'll speak to you soon guys bye
plus it has some other significant improvements
I could sue the Smart Home gadgets
I already had connected inside the app
but they're good holding the tablet horizontally
this is one of those drawing tablets
I'm used to thinking of touch commands
spend me up quite a bit now
the stylus is standalone also like many
anyway actually confirm that with the artists
the glass is a little bit thicker
you're getting so much value for money
so is this for beginners or not
I have no idea about that game
the tablet runs about $30 on Amazon
this tablet is 4 inches by 2
it was even more painful to draw
it works fine with both paint tool
the buttons on the pen are customizable
I hope this kind of helped anybody
there is on the top left section
i thought it was a nice touch
um you guys should check out senselabs
it's a great great alternative to wacom
you will find my summary and verdict
hopefully it'll be too busy with zombies
it wasn't powered so i missed it
it's very solid check out other reviews
i love mine in july 2015 and
so why would they stop doing that
it is not much to see either
i have it open in many times
are there no speakers on this thing
there is a problem with the speakers
it is a 10.1 inch at IPS
LG v10 phone because of the Bob
i'm not entirely sure what that means
I never had any problems with it
yeah no that's not a good idea
alright this is not a good game
I'm going to skip out of this
is you know personal opinion or speculation
all right you can make it thinner
because i use is every day seriously
you know there's no point so for
this has been out for a while
I mean they're all capable of playing
you can buy these in the text
I screwed that up but the yeah
this video would be 20 minutes long
I like the way they do this
that was like when that came out
they're all capable of playing asphalt 8
what do you guys think about this
it has a good amount of keys
that's a little bit of a boomer
Gangwon cursor position is not 100% accurate
all you do is select the tune
check out that link in the description
and that's no longer the case overall
we're going to be uploading some more
TV project BRZ with its newfound horsepower

grab your food and away you go
Kobo has like on their main website

this is all this is worth it
I've got it narrowed down to two
alright here we go we got am
this also comes with some other things
if you can't afford that totally understand
the live space on the graphics tablet
I would probably erase the first couple
there was plenty of pressure for what
part of that is at this point
drawing tablet for free sounded pretty appealing
that comes with the tablet is bubbly
you need to pressure the bubbles out
it would only take like 10 seconds
it has a paper like sturdy feeling
not really anything to complain about here
so maybe it's worth that price tag
it's got a really really nice surface
it's just because we're used to it
it's got a very very nice feeling
absolutely fine there was no issues whatsoever
no problems there worked really well like
I said the drivers seemed really good
hopefully a card in the corner fire
I see anything hasn't got obviously it
it's got all your nibs in there
you can actually use it like this
they seem to have thought of everything
I think that's probably enough for me
it's got left and right handed support
everyone would be a lot more appreciative
and it messed up my recordings so
the drivers were really easy to download
there's no need to replace any batteries
the screen came with a screen protector
I had is that a few times
drawing tablet this is a drawing monitor
everything is well wrapped up and protected
the cables are as compact as possible
I began with a sketch layer then
I really enjoyed working with the tablet
I thought the performance was really good
it is something to keep in mind
I also really liked the pen design
it's smaller than the other digital pens
I know these screens are not cheap
this one is more affordable than others
hi everyone welcome back to our channel
i'm not sure i'm pronouncing that right
and it's for ages three and up
the hot dog paint box sounds fun

hello patrick jumped on top of him
I really loved the large drawing area
I never felt cramped which is important
this tablet can also go wireless which
download the XP pengie for 30 drivers
I think happens when I play osoo
that is a big problem when playing
that is a case for the screen
don't lose that and let more chords
this is kind of hard open it
I'll show you in a second see
you can do that on your tablet
this tablet was unveiled in last year
grilles this is a 10 inch ips
another thing i didn't like about this
one is the brightness of the screen
the degree of the detail is appropriate
which you might feel is too little
so just check that out with that
Super AMOLED screen and in this video
we'll be doing a full in-depth review
the staff s 10.5 is powered by
how vibrant they look on this tab
I noticed some cons with the stylus
I don't feel that they're very loud
the speaker should have been front firing
this is the stand for the pen
it's nice to touch and build quality
let me try and draw slow lines
well let's try to slow lines again
I've actually assigned here so I click
I can recommend very easily for us
it has a lot of shortcut buttons
This doesn’t work on iPhones or iPads.
Next, plug the cord into the tablet.
Then plug the cable into your device.
Set your shortcut buttons at the top.
You may also reset to default here.
What do I think of this tablet?
Everything about drawing felt smooth and natural.

Is it the top and the bottom
It doesn't happen in the black one
Now something I'd say is the battery
life is pretty reasonable on this device
It does charge up in one hour.
So that's a pretty reasonable recharge time
I don't know the word for it
They give you some cartridges for free.
So it is a very handy canvas
Now there is something called Live View.
Now there are some abilities for sketches
You can set it to flight mode
I think I really like it about

there's an awful lot to learn here
let's try something a bit bit bigger
what have we got on this thing
I presume over here just like Photoshop
you can have so much fun now
I've worked out what that is for
Wacom pen when I used a mouse
the tablet itself has 128 gigabyte solid

I don't feel any issue with it
so everything you see from here owns
it has increased my speed and workflow
you can do any work of this
you can tell it was safely packaged
compared to other tablet pens of youth
it's not too heavy not too light
they give you whatever function you want
I really like that kind of texture
the tablet itself has like rounded edges
I hope that you found this interesting
it's actually doing a really good job
it is running on android oreo 8.1
you want something that is more stock

daddy ooh woo a Rex on Jack
Rhine cinema look hanker code named Alex
SSD is sure to fill up fast
but you won't want to why not
megapixel sorry VGA quality front-facing camera essentially
you might want to play some games
the pen no longer uses any battery
it's a very typical drawing tablet design
this is this is very good performance
so you won't be able to change
it's excellent with the very strong software
see you in the next video bye
so let's go ahead and crack this
we've got the tablet front and center
this device comes with 32 gigs onboard
HDMI out and we have our microphone
Play Store so there isn't any limitations
everything worked flawlessly and everything rendered nicely
so it's kind of hit or miss
it's not the most ideal playing scenario
Keogh for sending out this review unit
hey I heard you guys like bezels
CPU and a much more powerful GPU
there's just not a lot so what
so first up we have 3d mark
we have antutu total score 90 1649

that's awesome a little bats up there
I've never actually had to do so
I didn't have any glitches with those
the tablet comes with inside the pen
they can barely fit anything onto well
probably not the best for you know
let's go ahead and close that now
is you can run full desktop applications
but it gives you a full size
the keyboards about 1.7 pounds and together
HD display in terms of overall performance
Haswell CPU but in terms of benchmarks
slow internet connections not making this ideal
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
the tablet itself weighs about three pounds
that sort of thing is fine now
this which is still really darn crazy
so the display on this supports touch
do diagramming all that sort of thing
this feels like a regular laptop keyboard
that's either barrel pin or USB see
you can impact battery life pretty strongly
it makes it for mobile tech review
so this is a very large tablet
this is how the stylist look like
the grip section is also hot plastic
let's take a closer look at it
it retracts a bit into the stylus
the stylus has 8192 levels of pressure
this is quite good lines of versus
that's not going to be any problem
that pressure works here as well so
Pro this is a very nice software
this is something to take note off
Pro it's quite smooth to work on
I wasn't able to reproduce them today
I prefer 10 by 6 inches now
it is a 10 inch graphics tablet
there we go right off the bat
I don't know what the material is
it's nice and smooth so good pen
let's look what was inside the box
it's very simple very sleek not overdone
you can see on the side here
you can barely see these things which
it feels nice in the hand obviously
I do not enjoy them at all
I like the look of the tablet
that would actually be perfect because then
I care about I don't care about
I think with a plastic thing anyway
I'm gonna put that in this review
three-wide why it means that it's wider
you don't need any gadget like this
installing the tablet is very very simple
I want it to be more neutral
the tablet comes with five different buttons
the brightness turned all the way up
i wasn't able to set it up
hope you all have a great day
I'm now using it for two months
the picture quality is not that good
and if you want to get it
6.8 gigabyte are used by the system
seven is much better doing everyday use
the performance is not great for multitasking
Kobo tablet why do I need it
things can happen if you lose it
I'll do it on the next one
see phrase in a plastic bag thought
this is Lisa from mobile tech review
AES technology that's the newer Wacom technology

ThinkPad displays this one has great characteristics

who likes to game a little bit
the x1 tablet does a fantastic job
I was getting some fantastic battery life
this is an upgrade over the prior
I think it's probably just fine now
it's got a nice weight to it
the screen as you can see here
you've got a 10.1 inch IPS display
so you can pop in additional storage
Prime video are also available on this
this comes up very quickly as well
there's one more mode to show you
show my advice would be to have
sorry about the background noise my mic
it's got two buttons on the side
I'm pretty sure you can order gloves
I don't know if that's focusing on
the cable coming out the side good
so I'm guessing ctrl Z or Z
I think I accidentally just Christa cause
yeah that's true our self an eyeball
setups you got a five megapixel shooter
it's solid as i'm tapping the screen
i have no issues out of that
i think it's a really good buy

I I was really surprised by this
the lines are consistent as much as
I'm getting thick when I want thick
that's just an old wives tale now
which is absolutely awesome for a budget
this is pretty awesome for a tablet
here you can see there's different straightaway
why would you need to be color
you know it's 15.6 so 16 inches
I want to do a longer sketch
I don't know how to explain it

getting scratched over time without a protector.
Wearing a glove helped reduce the oil
A screwdriver and screws for the stand.
The stand is heavier than the tablet.

Close this and run the tablet again.
